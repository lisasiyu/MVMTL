thinking  out  loud （ 初回 限定 盤 ）（ dvd 付 ）  sounds  monotonous  to  me  this  album  let  me  down ;  every  song  sounds  boring  and  doesn 't  come  to  my  mind  to  me .  actually ,  i  have  been  interested  in  bonnie  pink  since  a  perfect  sky  was  a  smash  hit .  and  what  disappoints  me  more  is  the  different  version  of  a  perfect  sky  in  this  album .  the  main  reason  is  that  the  tune  is  completely  watered  down  in  this  version .  since  i  love  a  perfect  sky ,  the  diluted  version  is  a  total  failure ,  if  you  ask  me .  i  had  expected  this  album  to  be  more  exciting  like  the  original  version  of  a  perfect  sky .  what  a  waste !
