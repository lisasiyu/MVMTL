スティール ・ ホイールズ   just  a  tad  noisy  i  know  it  is  not  polite  to  review  music  types  you  do  not  like .  however  i  did  not  know  i  did  not  like  this  until  i  listened .  it  is  not  the  genre  it  is  this  album  that  is  off .  it  is  very  noisy  and  with  out  substance .  it  must  have  been  designed  for  a  particular   8 0 ' s  environment  the  once  removed  has  no  connection  with  anything  of  value .  sorry  but  it  sounds  like  someone  practicing  in  the  garage  and  not  sure  where  they  are  going .
