セイント ・ アンガー  it 's  time  to  say  goodbye  first  of  all ,  this  album  sounds  raw  and  heavy  and  fast  like  their  garage  days .  but ... songs ... ..  i  bet  kirk  quit  the  band  within   3   years .  i  don 't  think  kirk  would  be  proud  of  this  album .  sounds  like  no  more  kirk  at  all .
