永遠 の 哲学 ― 究極 の リアリティ  ( mind  books )  " we  read  to  know  that  we  are  not  alone "  ( c .s .  lewis )  this  is  a  good  anthology  of  the  perennial  philosophy .  the  design  is  easy  to  follow  and  too  interesting  to  put  aside .  the  excerpts  from  many  sources  are  organized  in  such  subjects  as  " good  and  evil "  and  " time  and  eternity ."   he  specifically  chose  people  that  experienced  what  they  are  talking  about  as  apposed  to  philosophers  that  take  educated  guesses  at  reality .  some  individual  reader  may  come  to  different  conclusions .  but  at  least  what  is  presented  here  is  a  concept  not  to  be  missed .  
  this  book  makes  a  great  stepping  stone  to  all  the  other  writings  and  a  good  starting  place  for  ones  personal  quest .  there  is  a  pretty  comprehensive  list  of  recommended  books .  
  the  excerpts  are  encapsulated  with  a  clear  definition  and  other  examples  of  what  is  being  expressed .  it  is  always  better  to  have  someone  tell  you  what  you  already  know  but  in  a  different  way .  this  allows  for  different  insights .  more  then  that  it  lets  us  know  that  " we  are  not  alone ."
