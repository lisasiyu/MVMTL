みんな の 日本 語初 級 1   漢字 英語 版  different  and  effective  the  book  follows  the  kanji  of  the  chapters ,  but  instead  of  flooding  you  with  all  of  the  kanji  from  the  unit ,  it  gives  you  the  most  important ,  building  your  ability .  there  are  a  variety  of  activities  as  well .  what  impresses  me  about  the  book  is  that ,  while  it  does  its  own  system ,  it  definitely  gives  you  essential  kanji  and  kanji  combinations  ( !)  that  i  haven 't  found  in  other  books .  very  cool .  i  used  this  book  ( in  addition  to  the  other  books  in  the  first  set )  to  prepare  for  the  jplt  level   3 .  the  structure  is  totally  different  from  the  test ,  but  i  was  pleasantly  surprised  how  well  prepared  i  was .  definitely  worth  owning .
