a clever imposture in his 1000 or so unparagraphed pages , littell draws a picture , which defies credibility , of a fictional ss-man who is personified evil . the caricature is so gross that it exonerates the average unexceptional ss-man , making him seem less bad by comparison . i assume this was not littell 's intent . fortunately and whatever its 'readers ' may say , the book is unreadable . ||| a clever deception in his 1000 or so pages unparagraphed , littell draws a picture , which defies credibility , of a fictional ss-man who is evil personified . the caricature is so gross that it exonerates the average unexceptional ss-man , making him seem less bad by comparison . i assume this was not littell 's intent . fortunately and whatever its 'readers ' may say , the book is unreadable .
