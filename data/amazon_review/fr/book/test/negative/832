a qui profite le développement durable ? short book , many flaws sylvie brunel ( sb ) est-elle une créationniste ? she certainly is a post-modernist : she proclaims « la `` planète '' n'existe pas indépendamment de l'homme » ( @ 39 ) and « la nature est partout une construction sociale » ( @ 80 ) . so what would you call the 4,597 million years of the earth 's existence before the advent of the first hominids ? sb does n't go so far as to claim this was really only five days . but she does assure us `` l'homme n'est pas et ne sera jamais un animal '' ( @ 90 ) , and that humans are more important than animals ( e.g . @ 81ff ; 98 ; 100-101 ) . in effect , sb adopts the bible 's view that the planet and all life in it are at the service of man ( ch.1 ; also @ 85 ) , and that man and the planet are coeval . man is separate from his environment , not a part of it ( @ 66-68 ) . the assertions form part of the book 's fundamental premise : the equation of développement durable ( dd ) with environmentalism and `` conservation '' . sb is right to fault most companies for using dd as a pretext for capitalism-as-usual , and to suggest that effort should be spent on adapting to global warming ( e.g. , relocation of coastal communities ) , as well as on prevention . and she is sympathetic in her concern that poor people should have better access to the necessities of life and self-fulfillment . but she 's wrong to claim that dd excludes these latter concerns ( see , e.g. , _just sustainabilities_ , edited by j. agyeman & amp ; al. , eds. , ( mit press 2003 ) ) . so her book 's basic premise is false . sb 's arguments are often mired in overreaching rhetoric and contradictions . she trots out mainstream economists ' familiar assertions that « des ressources fabriquées matérielles » and « des ressources immatérielles [ , e.g . ] les compétences et les qualifications des hommes » can be substituted for natural or material resources ( @ 66 ) . is it so simple , then , to use bricks and diplomas as substitutes for food or fuel ? she sets up a tian'anmen standoff between the few persons « [ qui ] osent exprimer leurs doutes » about global warming against the « 2 000 , 3 000 , 4 000 » scientists mobilized by the giec/ ipcc , « ce formidable rouleau compresseur onusien » ( @ 113 ) ; and she compares « ceux qui prônent la sagesse des peuples anciens » to nazis ( @ 94-95 ) . sb declares her own faith in technology to solve problems ( e.g. , her confidence that co2-neutral cars that will be developed in china and india , @ 36 ) , but blames others for having this faith ( @ 69 ) . she 's against anglo-saxon market liberalism ( @ 51 ; 61 ) , and in favor of it ( @ 26-29 ; 90 ) . she ridicules the claim that global warming can cause both desertification and floods ( @ 15 ) , yet argues later that its effects are highly dependent on local geography ( @ 119 ) . she decries elitism ( ch.3 ) but condemns traditional societies without any qualification ( @ 92 ) . sb ignores some valid criticisms of dd . `` durable '' use levels of various resources are hard to keep track of , and in many cases do n't even exist in principle . moreover , perpetual economic growth is n't physically feasible on our planet , since the laws of physics show that all economic activity must create thermal or material waste . but rather than refuting - or embracing - the economist who pointed out these limitations , n. georgescu-roegen , sb simply makes the bizarre assertion that his ideas were anticipated by ivan illich ( @ 72 ) . although she mentions christian comeliau 's 2006 book , « la croissance ou le progrès ? » in her bibliography ( @ 155 ) , she flatly rejects décroissance ( @ 72 ) -- even though comeliau 's nuanced point is that décroissance might be appropriate for , and only for , some rich countries ( comeliau @ 10 ; 292 ) . while some of sb 's objectives seem sympathetic and sincere , they are ill-served by her extreme arguments . the absence of any concrete affirmative agenda is also regrettable .
