la solution à sept pour cent : d'après un manuscrit inédit du d watson not so elementary ... the canon of sherlock holmes consists of a set of short stories and novels penned by sir arthur conan doyle -- fifty-six short stories and four novels . however , this is a rather small corpus for such a large character , and even within the lifetime of the conan doyle , others turned their attention to working through different holmes/watson stories , filling in odd gaps in their lives , and sometimes greatly embellishing the legends . holmes and watson have travelled to outer space , through time , and have even had their genders switched in such tales .
