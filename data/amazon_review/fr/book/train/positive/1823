sans parler du chien ou comment nous retrouvâmes enfin la potiche de l'évêque a wonderous melange this is one of the most interesting literary mixes i 've ever come across , all the more surprising as it appears in the form of a science-fiction time-travel book . the book itself is a mix of hard sci-fi , victorian comedy of errors and manners , and cozy mystery . literary homages ( most notably to three men in a boat ) and references abound , including p.g . wodehouse 's jeeves books , gibbon 's decline and fall of the roman empire , not to mention tennyson 's poetry and herotodus ( who are both quoted throughout ) . the story has to do with a project in 2057 to rebuild the coventry cathedral , and time-traveling historians sent back to study its contents prior to the bombing of 1940 . the story is set in motion when one of the historians somehow brings a victorian-era cat through the time-travel `` net , '' contravening the natural laws governing time-travel . the heroes must then return the cat in order to correct any `` anomalies , '' but this gets them enmeshed in a matchmaking fiasco with loads of fun and well-drawn archetypes of the era ( the ditzy girl , the absentminded oxford don , the seance-loving matron , and miscellaneous butlers ) . and of course , by the end , all mysteries are revealed , everyone is paired off , and everything neatly dovetails . truly a wondrous feat of writing and imagination .
