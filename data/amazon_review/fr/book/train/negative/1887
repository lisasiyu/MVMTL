20 u.l.b . etude voyage bout de la nuit ( ancienne edition ) historically notable but a stale read today one of the problems with reading revolutionary books long after their initial publication is that they often do n't seem so , well ... revolutionary . such is the case with c√©line 's semi-autobiographical masterpiece-a 440 page behemoth that despite lively scenes here and there is very often tedious and boring . i gather that much of the controversy around it at the time was with regards to its use of `` naturalistic '' and `` vulgar '' language and slang ( perhaps akin to the love/hate critical reaction to scottish authors like james kelman and irvine welsh in the late part of the century ) . while it may have represented a profound stick in the eye of literary conventions back in 1932 , it certainly has n't retained any capacity to shock or surprise in that regard . if you 're a fan of the dark side of 20th century popular literature as represented by those such as henry miller , bukowski , kerouac , burroughs , vonnegut , joseph heller , et al ( notice that you 'll find no women on this list ) , you find it an interesting read just to see where they got some of their sensibilities , but otherwise it gets old fast .
