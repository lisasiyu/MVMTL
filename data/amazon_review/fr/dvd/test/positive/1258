le colosse de rhodes excellent fantastic dvd with many wonderful extras . beautiful , sharp , wide screen transfer but unfortunately , there is no english audio track -only french and italian - also there are no english subtitles . still , it 's a great movie and a great dvd . i just wish i knew what they were talking about , but these films are so 'visual ' that it dose n't really matter . put in your own dialogue .
