dagon there is something fishy about dagon two couples are out on yachting . they hear some sort of singing or chanting from the local village of imboca . a freak storm appears and tosses the yacht on the rocks . one girl gets her leg caught between the yacht and a hard place . so the other couple paul ( ezra godden ) and b√°rbara ( raquel merono ) brakes out the `` rubber '' raft and go for help . naturally the raft gets a hole in it so we just can not wait for something in the water to eat them raft and all . mean while back at the boat blood is spewing out into the water . i assumed they were the desert .
