rod√©o tour [ blu-ray ] not better than dvd ! the quality of the normal zazie dvd is quite ok , even though there are digital and compression mistakes clearly visible . to be honest : this blu-ray is no better than the dvd . the same mistakes are still very visible and there is no image improvement . my advice : do n't spend money on this one , just buy the normal dvd . it 's a shame this blu-ray is released by mercury . they just want to make as much money as fast as possible on the blu-ray market by releasing this inferior quality blu-ray . the 1991 ( ! ) hd-recording of tori amos live at montreux is ten times better than this zazie release !
