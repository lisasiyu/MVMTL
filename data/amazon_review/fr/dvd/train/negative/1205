bowling for columbine - Ã©dition collector 2 dvd extremely tedious tedious tedious tedious i am sure there was an agenda before their film was made . but what ever it was is lost in inconsistent and repetitious interview style questions . i did like the calendar girls ; i did not realize you could get such calendars . the militia looked like a neat organization . when they do interviews with canadians for contrast i thought i was watching `` canadian bacon '' with john candy . they did mention nukes but did not go to the other extreme and count how many people were knifed and hacked ( lizzy borden ) due to the absence of a proper firearm . no mention of the fact than kung fu is necessary so one can kill when deprived of proper defensive devices . they seem to be fascinated with charlton heston . `` home of the brave and land of the free '' ; his presents is peppered throughout the film . i suspect that the title comes from the fact that the students in columbine went bowling before their spree .
