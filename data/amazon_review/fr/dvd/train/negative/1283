y-a-t-il un flic pour sauver l'humanité ? this is the same man that was in forbidden planet ? the president has been cloned . it is up to dick dix ( plural ) to rescue him from an alien plot . naturally his sidekick is a sexy blond ( ophélie winter ) and he encounters too many close encounters of the third kind . in these days of diversity it is almost impossible to find a one star product . well here it is . this poor film had no body to save it . the script has a superficial appearance but never follows through . the slapstick humor is not professional enough to get a giggle . their timing is off and the mystery is not . this animal is not even in the same category as a spoof . if you see the first few minutes you have seen it all .
