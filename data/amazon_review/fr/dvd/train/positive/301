le clan des siciliens brilliant drama but a mutilated dvd-production this is a great and atmospheric gangster film , one of the best french films of the genre , made at the peak of the period when people still had the feeling for pure cinema . great direction from verneuil , who at his best equalled melville , fine production values and superb cast .
