johnny mad dog an important movie jmd takes us to places the vast majority of people never have to go . choosing to watch this account of `` child soldiers '' is a choice to be confronted but also touched by the experience of lives shattered by violence and terror which have no other purpose than to terrorise . this is an important documentation of what otherwise might be dismissed as incredible . the performances of all involved are quite amazing as we see those who have been brutalised become the brutalisers , afraid of what might happen should they break the chain of violent power . my first viewing was quite overwhelming .
