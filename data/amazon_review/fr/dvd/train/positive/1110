gosford park - édition collector 3 dvd surprisingly different this has the look and feel of english `` who-done-it '' . it is as much the society as it is a mystery . the first quarter of the movie is just introductions to the characters as they approach the manor . then the discussions start as they are settling in and the sub plots show up but do not overwhelm the main story . if you are trying g to guess ahead forget it . also plan for every english cliché . i suggest that you use the closed caption option the first time through as the mumble a lot and the background music is louder than the speech tract . do n't be surprised to find that it has ended just as you are getting into it . the dvd extras add a dimension to the movie as after watching them you can view the movie with out the sub tittles .
