la valse des pantins ( Ã©dition simple ) the court jester rules martin scorsese 's 'the king of comedy ' has long been a favourite film of mine . the storyline is nothing grand , and the acting is passing fair , but it is the little psychological pieces that keep poking in that make this movie an interesting one to watch .
