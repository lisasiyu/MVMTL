victor victoria julie andrews has an exceptional vocal range this movie is pretty much a remake of viktor und viktoria ( 1933 ) which is still available on dvd from amazon.de . however there is a character ( blake edwards as charles bovin , private investigator hired by labisse ) that distracts from the movie by using too many slapstick scenes that do not fit the story .
