das boot ( le bateau ) how do you expect other sub movies to compete ? by now you know everyone thinks this is one of the greatest movies in the cinema . it is described as realistic , and has great camera work . you could probably go on forever about the actors and the directors and so forth . what is really interesting is they are all correct ; this is one of the best sub movies ever . and you do get swallowed up in the action . there are other movies that can rival this one . yet it does not diminish what was accomplished here . the base story is the daily lives of an unterseeboot crew . it shows the trials and tribulations they must go through to accomplish their missions . one thing you can be sure of is that this is not an anti war movie . they would not be there if they were not hunters .
