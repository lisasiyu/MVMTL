classic cinema sounds this is one of those discs that has had a long life in my house - i first had the soundtrack of star wars on cassette tape , then when that broke ( from being overplayed ) , i got the vinyl version ( so i could re-record the tracks in a better order ) . when that record set got worn and poppy , i got the cd , and then when this special edition came out , i got it too . so , i guess one could say that this is a perennial favourite . ||| classic cinema sound this is one of those discs that has had a long life in my house - i had the first soundtrack of star wars on cassette tape , then when that broke ( from being overplayed ) , i got the vinyl version ( so i could re-record the tracks in a better order ) . when that record set got worn and poppy , i got the cd , and then when this special edition came out , i got it too . so , i guess one could say that this is a perennial favorite .
