arias one more handel cd first of all i would like to make clear from the begining that the point of my review is not to criticize rolando villazon 's talent and voice as a performer and musical instrument.because human voice is a musical instrument.but ... is anybody out there who realy believes that all we need is one more cd with handel opera arias especialy from the super star tenor rolando villazon ? what about so many singers talented baroque opera performers like gilles ragon , carlo vincenzo allemano , laurent naouri , paul agnew , jerome correas , janet williams , ewa malas godlewska , isabelle poulenard , anne-lise sollied , iris vermillion and many others who have spent their lifes performing baroque vocal music and never been given the opportunity to record their personal cds with baroque arias.yes , of course they do n't belong to a big recording label like decca , deutsche gramophone or virgin classics where the rest composers from the baroque period are not as prominent as handel.fortunately some of them like mark padmore , sandrine piau , veronica cangemi ( an amazing soprano who recently recorded her debut portrait cd ) and the late lorraine hunt liberson made excellent recordings that clear up what baroque vocal music is stood for.recently rolando villazon began to perform and record baroque music with emmanuelle haim but i am not quite sure if this was haim 's choice or virgin 's claim.the fact is that the lyric tenor of the romantic type was unknown to baroque opera.the baritone-tenor and the bass were only used in roles such as the rival of the lover ( who usaly was a castrato or a female singer in travesti , in character parts , and at some periods in buffo parts.if you are a villazon 's fun you probably be delighted but if you are a baroque vocal music lover who likes historically based performances i do not recomend this cd.if you want to find out the truth about the baroque vocal music ( the real bel canto ) , rodolfo celletti 's book 'a history of bel canto ' is available in amazon .
