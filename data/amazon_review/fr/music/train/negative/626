oops ! ... i did it again one star for the guy on the knobs this is perhaps the most puerile dribble i have heard . what it has is a seductive , strong drumbeat , hypnotically sucking the listener into a morass of silliness . some of the lyrics are almost funny in their awkwardness , and verge on illiteracy . `` my friends say you 're so into me and that you need me desperately they say you say we 're so complete '' worse yet is the cover of the jagger/richards `` ( i ca n't get no ) satisfaction '' , which is full of vocalized wiggles and oooh ahhh uhhhs in a girlish whisper .
