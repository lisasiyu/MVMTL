eh eh ( nothing else i can say ) weak single until now this is for sure the weakest lady gaga 's single : the original version is quite boring nothing more than a silly pop song . only the remix by psb is the reason to buy this single , even if even their mix does n't change the song in a good song . totally to ignore the other mix . save your money and buy something else , or just download only the psb mix .
