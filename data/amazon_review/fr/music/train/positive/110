live at woodstock hey joe , where you goin ... i grew up in the woodstock era and was actually stationed in nearby west point after my viet nam tour . so this collection or documentary `` the road to woodstock '' directed by bob smeaton also holds a piece of me history . i must say i almost did not watch this film as the front have was a packed with sound bites of people doing just what i did in the first paragraph of this review ; they spent too much time telling how great they were and then some antidote about jimi . hang in there you will be carried away . this is as close to live as you are going to get . jimi is one of those performers that when let lose can perform rings around his formal recordings . some times i think it is an acquired taste . i have to confess besides his adaptation of `` starspangled banner '' i was taken back more by `` hey joe '' written by billy roberts . of course everyone has their favorites . no mater how you look/listen to it this production deserves a place in your collection .
