legend absolutely marvelous ! all of his major hits are here . the remastered audio is outstanding , to say the least . i can hear evey single nuance of the music . it 's as if i were present at the original studio sessions . the only thing i did n't like , in this respect , is that yoko 's wild , maniacal caterwauling can now be heard loud and clear on the xmas track . was that there all the time ? or is this another one of her ploys to say `` here i am , again folks ! '' ? anywho , it 's a great collection in my book !
