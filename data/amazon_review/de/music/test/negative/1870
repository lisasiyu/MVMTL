bat out of hell iii : the monster is loose it 's only a loud album worse than i was expecting . such music becomes an exhausting matter to hear if it has n't a thread , a soul , no myth , no spirit behind all that . this album is nothing but loud , always `` power power power '' , filled with unfulfilled ambitions ( best example is the superfluous piece `` monstro '' ) . again and again you hear orchestrally painted segments which adhere to soundtracks of last jugdement movies . even the sticky pop songs in between of the anthems are pushed this way ( where they actually do n't belong on a bat out of hell at all ) unlike vol i and ii , bat out of hell iii does n't excite you as a whole , you ca n't listen to it like watching a movie . it does n't drag you in . you need a break after half of it , or skip . there is a lack of a quiter atmosphere on some occasions , that is what created a more emotional depth on the provious vol 's . meat loaf sings at full throttle from the first to the very last note ( which is the word `` hell '' ) . i 'm afraid this is the last bat note you will ever hear . meat loaf wanted to have the trilogy finished at the age of about 60 . he is older already . when you see him on stage , after 1 hour , you see pain .
