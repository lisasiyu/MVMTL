greatest hits the a-clones if ever there was a group that was undeserving of its fame and wealth than these four abba clones were it . much younger than abba , but without the powerful voices to carry off the harmonious sounds of the original group ( their questionable vocals were obviously tweaked digitally ) the four cleverly borrowed from britney spears ' lolita-esque image as well . two innocent looking but seductive schoolgirls and schoolboys ( two blonds and two brunets to further ape the originals ) put a techno spin on abba 's greatest hits and earned millions , then quickly split up and headed for pastures new , which included a stint on the catwalk for the two blonds . what became of the brown half of the quartet is a mystery.the pop rip off of the nineties ... rip a-teens . you are history whereas abba will remain a living legend .
