gülümse as a german living in the middle east ( gulf region ) i truly appreciate sezen aksu , the queen of turkish pop music ! as a german living in the middle east - gulf region : oman , emirates , saudi arabia , quatar , bahrain , kuwait , ... - i truly do appreciate the music from that area . the rhythm is always mystical and very highly personal . you can feel the instruments and the musical tones which the artist wants you to feel . the musician wants to take you on a trip . they want to take you to a world unlike any other . and in this album , the very popular female singer sezen aksu manages to do just that . sezen aksu - a portrait sezen aksu , born as fatma sezen in july 13 , 1954 in denizli is a turkish pop music singer , song-writer and producer popular at home and abroad . she has sold over 40 million albums . her nicknames include the `` queen of turkish pop '' and minik serçe ( `` little sparrow '' ) . aksu 's influence on turkish pop and world music has continued since her debut in 1975 , and has been reinforced by her patronage of and collaboration with many other musicians , including sertab erener , ebnem ferah , akn nur yengi , hande yener , and levent yüksel . her work with tarkan resulted in continental hits and her collaboration with goran bregovi widened her international audience . sezen aksu was born fatma sezen in sarayköy , turkey . her family moved to zmir when she was 3 years old and she spent her childhood and early youth there . after finishing high school , she began studying at the local agricultural institute , but left college to concentrate on music . along with her close friend ajda pekkan , aksu is credited with laying the foundations of turkish pop music in the 1970s . her sound has also spread across the balkans and greece . it was this sound that changed the face of the eurovision song contest when her protegé sertab erener won in 2003 . aksu has also toured in europe and the u.s to critical appraise . she has championed a variety of causes , including women 's rights , the environment , and educational reform in turkey . aksu has been married and divorced four times , but kept the name from her first marriage to ali engin aksu , a doctor of geology who currently resides in canada . she has a son with sinan özer . sezen aksu released her first single , haydi/gel bana ( come on my luck/come to me ) in 1975 under the name of sezen seley . however , she remained undiscovered until her 1976 single olmaz olsun/vurdumduymaz ( wish it never happened/insensitive ) reached number one in the turkish charts . her first album was 1978 's serçe ( sparrow ) , which was to give her the nickname , penned by a turkish journalist . an aksu drive finally got turkey to apply for the eurovision song contest in the mid-70s . ironically however , even though she competed in the national finals for the competition three times - `` küçük bir ak masal '' ( a little love tale ) was a duet with özdemir erdoan , `` heyamola '' was performed as a trio with cokun demir and ali kocatepe and `` 1945 '' was her solo performance - none got the chance to represent turkey abroad . it was to be left to her pupil erener to win the eurovision and realise aksu 's dream to push her musical vision further into europe . in the 80 's , aksu had a relationship with producer onno tunç that was both romantic and professional . the couple put their signatures to works that broke new ground in turkish pop music , such as sen alama ( do n't cry ) , git ( go ) , sezen aksu'88 and sezen aksu söylüyor ( sezen aksu sings ) . her music matured in the 90 's , when she co-produced her best selling album to-date gülümse ( smile ) with tunç . the a-1 track from the album called hadi bakalm ( come on now ) was a hit in turkey and europe , and was published as a single in germany . it was to be later rediscovered in europop by singer loona as rhythm of the night . she also began to produce albums for her vocalists , notably producing akn nur yengi 's debut album sevgiliye ( to the one i love ) again with tunç . she was to repeat this successfully with artists erener and yüksel . parting ways with tunç , in 1995 , aksu branched out with the experimental album ik doudan yükselir ( light rises from the east ) , drawing both on western classical and regional turkish musical traditions . this album made her name outside turkey and gave her a world music following across europe . in 1996 , she released dü bahçeleri ( dream gardens ) as a tribute to tunç , who died that same year tragically when his private plane crashed . in 1997 , she released düün ve cenaze ( the wedding and the funeral ) , this time collaborating with goran bregovi . she returned to her roots with ad bende sakl ( its name is hidden in me ) , which was released in 1998 . she began to use experimental sounds and was once again pushing turkish pop into the future . aksu continued with this trend with her subsequent albums deliveren ( crazymaker ) , ark söylemek lazm ( got ta sing ) , yaz bitmeden ( before the summer ends ) between the years 2000 - 2003 . after a two year hiatus , she returned with bahane ( excuse ) in 2005 . that same year she released kardelen ( snowdrop ) where all proceeds went to charity , and before the end of 2005 released a bahane/remixes ( excuse/remixes ) double-cd album which contained the original bahane album in disc one and the remixes of songs in bahane in disc two . at the end of the year her albums bahane , kardelen and the re-released album ark söylemek lazm were the three best-selling albums in the country . in 2005 she was featured in fatih akin 's documentary film `` crossing the bridge : the sound of istanbul '' with a performance of the song `` istanbul hatirasi . '' aksu has recently been re-releasing all her old classics digitally remastered and with specially designed new sleeves . after her concert tour in summer 2006 , she will record a new album in the usa . sezen aksu performed at the royal albert hall in london , on 7th october 2007 . after zeki muren , she is the second turkish artist to have performed at rah , london . new york city based label breaking records released karine hannahs debut cd `` i 'll be alright '' on july 31 , 2007 . hannah collaborated with producers eve nelson ( hayley westenra , laura branigan , chaka kahn ) and ayhan sahin ( sandra bernhard , beu sisters , vonzell solomon ) on an album of english-language covers originally recorded by turkeys most-acclaimed female singer/songwriter sezen aksu . recorded in new york , il be alright recasts some of turkeys most memorable songs with english lyrics and contemporary arrangements , conceived , arranged and produced by nelson and sahin . standouts on hannahs album include ill be alright inspired by the vanity fair article on jennifer aniston after the split , drink sure to be a juke box favorite , rash & amp ; burn about where the planet is going if we dont wake up , and the beautiful someday .
