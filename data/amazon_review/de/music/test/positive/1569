meets the francy boland - kenny clarke big band great cd i highly recommend this cd of gitte haenning , great voice , great singin and great arragements ! excellent sound quality for a recording of 1968 ! ! just beware that this cd has not the original title , so be sure you do n't have it already in your collection as it has been issued already on cd with the title : `` out of this world '' . while the original lp title seems to be `` my kind of world '' quite confusing indeed ! so a little attention is needed before getting it .
