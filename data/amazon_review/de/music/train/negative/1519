dancecore disappointment ! ! ! before i got the dancecore cd i had heard back in town , dropp the bass and junkfood junkies remix of the everybody . i really like those songs and i was really exiting about dancecore but when it came and i listened it it turned to be the biggest disappointment that i had ever had in the record zone . only rocco kind of song , that i thought that album would be fullfilled with , was generation of love and that is one and only reason i gave one star to this cd , even the rocco 's own version of the everybody is 100000000000000000 times worse than the junfood junkies remix . i do n't get why all the people say comments like : best record ... becauce it did not sound like i would have imagine because of my previous experience of rocco 's songs . and what is with those freeking skits ? leave them out please .
