hard candy the last for warner this is madonna 's last record for warner , i think madonna experiment a new style to see how far could she go , good or bad she had nothing to lose ... beside a couple of million fans that followed her since the beginning of her carrier . rumors saying that with this album she is trying gaining back her straight odiens tired of being associate with the homosexual scene . in my opinion everyone should stick on what they know best . ok r & amp ; b is `` cool '' right now , but is it the right choice for madonna ? or lets turn tables ... can you immagine eminem singing material girl or like a virgin . this madonna 's album is not for the fans . i listeng to it 4 time trying to like it ... . i was number 1 madonna 's fan but this album is worse than the american life flop , it is monotone , passive , boring , in some part annoyng and almost disturbing ... .. dont waist your money .
