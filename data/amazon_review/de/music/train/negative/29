anything but love too bad it 's really too bad that daniel could n't have been advised to take a better song and composer to release as his single instead of doing the `` best friends '' thing ( wtf ? ? ? ) and performing this pos as a compare and contrast exercise with his competitor . of course he could have handily won the vote with more than the 50.4 % of the vote that he actually did if he had sung something else like `` soulmate '' , as he did for his first number . he nailed the complexities of that song like a pro . now that he is a pro it is sad that he is starting off with a steaming piece of 3-chord bohlen crap like this . of course , it might make the top of the charts because of the dsds win and the rtl hype . and he might stay around for a while , but i 'm not sure if he will ever be a `` superstar '' - not if he keeps with bohlen and doing this tripe . but , his voice is actually quite good and more important , he actually knows how to use it . unfortunately , bohlen knows how to use it too .
