wizard s diary vol . 1 not the russian invasion the latest from hensley , an ex-uh keyboardist , features all the greatest hits listing of the famed band . what 's more important , those are totally new arrangements . the songs are given fresh dimention and vision . since ken found it hard to impress the west with his heavy ballad rock tradition , he wisely decided to record and produce this album completely in russia , and that `` trick '' has worked out well . the resulting sound is unique in its `` removed '' laid-back nature . it helps to underline hensley 's own part . the entire thing resembles early work by asia . the production is neat , and only the somewhat shabby booklet betrays this was actually russia .
