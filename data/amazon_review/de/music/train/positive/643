bring 'em in best ever this album probably is my favourite one ... ive bought it at the last of the 5 albums but i think its the very best one ... the songs sound like 70s music , great changes of the music stiles . there are some title to rock on , some title are pretty slowly and a bit sad . the best song on this album is `` lady '' - as also t-mobile found out and took this song for their commercial use . eyeryone who likes music from the seventies but also a very very good rock music from today should by this great album ! its the best one ive got ! ! !
