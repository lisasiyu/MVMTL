on the radio : greatest hits excellent collection on the radio is a brilliant collection of donna summer 's greatest hits from the middle to the late 1970s . as such it 's a mix of classic dance tracks and beautiful ballads . amongst the former , my favourites include the much re-released and remixed i feel love - the hypnotic pioneering synth-pop masterpiece , plus the breathtaking macarthur park , the rock-influenced hot stuff and bad girls plus sunset people and our love from the bad girls album . her early albums are also well represented with the tracks love to love you baby , try me and i remember yesterday , one of her best loved ballads . the album concludes with no more tears , her powerful duet with barbra streisand , and an extended version of on the radio . it 's a perfect showcase of donna 's versatility and contains all the chart hits from that era , but is by no means the full story on donna summer , who continued to make music throughout the 1980s and 1990s . good music ages well , and this collection is proof .
