eagle when she.. . one of dolly 's finest albums dolly recorded for columbia during the late eighties and early nineties , during which time she had three number one country hits during that period , the last of them ( rocking years ) coming from this album . rocking years was originally intended to be a duet with george jones but he left the label so ricky van shelton became the duet partner . the success of the single may have owed more to ricky ( who was fashionable at the time ) than dolly , as american country radio only showed limited interest in the other singles from this album . despite a lack of airplay , the album sold in vast quantities ( well over a million in the usa ) and deservedly so .
