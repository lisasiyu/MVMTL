destiny destiny ... fulfilled ? there are some things you can not deny . the fact that no angels are an enticing , loveable group with great vocal abilities is one of them . after the 'pure ' project was cut short and the girls decided to part ways for a while , it only seemed fitting for them to unite again . the result is 'destiny ' , and the sound is definitely no angels , sans vanessa who was definitely the one injecting a bit of sass and dare into the group 's agenda . this album is catchy and exciting , and debut single 'goodbye to yesterday ' clearly indicates that the sound of the angels is back to pure pop . although in-keeping with debut elle'ments and follow-up now ... us ! , 'destiny ' is a definite step back from the exciting rnb-tinged , rockier sound of 'pure ' , which had established the girls as credible artists with a unique pop sound , much like girls aloud in the uk . yet 'destiny ' is a clearly pleasing and enjoyable collection . opening number and debut single 'goodbye to yesterday ' is everything you want from a ballad with a light message , supported by a video showing the girls at their best in their `` it 's nice to be back '' mode . other outstanding cuts include `` been here before '' ( a track reminiscent of one of the girls ' finest moments , the mousse t. produced , remixed 'let 's go to bed ' ) , and the eighties-lite `` i had a feeling '' . the closing number oddly reminds of 'that 's the reason ' , the last track on no angels ' debut , later reworked for their 'best of ' album . all in all , 'destiny ' makes for pleasant , easy listening , with the added excitement of hearing from friends you had not heard from in a long time . it 's good to have the angels back ...
