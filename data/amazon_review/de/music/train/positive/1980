blessed ( premium ) seeing a swan and listening to black velvet this is the 1st song from an exceptional voice like black velvet , carrying true emotions wrapped in a lovely melody that grows on you and meaningful lyrics . 'blessed ' is only a 1st step for a potential world class singer and entertainer with unique charisma . especially for those of us who think twice before buying a cd , as to this one there 's no choice at all . if you 're looking for beauty you 'll find it here - both in product and in person , although the term 'product ' is almost a sacrilege in this case . blessed are the lucky ones who realized that they were witnesses of a star being born during those spring weeks , those who were able to watch bigger clouds of stardust coming down to a cologne stage every week . what seemed like a duckling turned into a swan - especially visible in that suit singing 'blessed ' . fady maalouf came a long way to help our emotions coming out of their shell and he has every right to accept our gratitude . any record company not willing to support this artist in the original sense of the word all the way had better ordered hearing aids and guide dogs for their executives . in the long run they would deeply regret not having invested in monsieur musique . if you 're looking for mediocrity buy any other record , if you 're looking for beauty , buy this one .
