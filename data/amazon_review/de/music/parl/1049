no power , bad production pretty dissapointing , i remember thinking 'on ya feet on ya knees ' ( or whatever it was called ) was pretty exciting when i was younger . bought this for a bit of nostalgia . the production is pretty bad ( as in the recording of the live concert , the quality of the dvd is terrible ) . the songs are mor crap with the odd half decent riff thrown in . i guess i do n't like böc much . ||| no power , bad production pretty dissapointing , i remember thinking 'on ya feet on ya knees ' ( or whatever it was called ) was pretty exciting when i was younger . bought this for a bit of nostalgia . the production is pretty bad ( as in the recording of the live concert , the quality of the dvd is terrible ) . the songs are mor crap with the odd half decent riff thrown in . i guess i do not like bÖc much .
