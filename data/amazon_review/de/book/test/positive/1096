my dear krauts : wie ich die deutschen entdeckte could have been so much more ( sorry to write in english - it 's just easier to express what i 'd like to say ) . back in summer 2006 , i read an article on the website of a popular german magazine , which went on to invite comments from british people 's experiences of germany . judging by the responses , there are a lot of common experiences and some of these do lend themselves to humourous anecdotes . we are different , after all ! as an englishman in germany i have to put up with countless jibes resulting from stereotypes about britons ( warm beer , mad cows , poor footballers , beer bellies , poor food , pale skin , etc ) . if you ca n't take a step back and see the funny side of these sterotypes , this probably is n't the book for you . for one reason or another , i assumed the story would include far more anecdotes of real-life experiences , which i hoped could be shared with friends and family to help them understand me a little better . where boyes does include such anecdotes , i laughed a lot . i was disappointed when i realised that the story could n't relate to actual events , as i 'd expected , and spent much of the book waiting for a climax that never actually came . it does n't really warrant the hammering it has received here but it could also have been longer , wittier , more cohesive and less hurried at the end . perhaps the bits that would make it all those things had to be edited out to make it more acceptable for german readers ?
