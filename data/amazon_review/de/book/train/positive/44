das orangene buch : die osho meditationen f√ºr das 21 . jahrhundert gnadenlos gut sorry for the english , i can read and speak german very well but writing it is just too dificult for me at the moment . this book is wonderful . please note that the only negative comments here are from those who ca n't get past their own predjudices and discuss the book objectively . even the one who tries to warn us that osho/bagwan was a `` dangerous cult-leader '' admits that he found the ideas stimulating and positive before coming across this misleading bit of propaganda . if you live a sheltered life under a rock , full of fear and are not ready to come out and live life to the fullest , then maybe this book is n't for you , *yet* . if you 're relatively open-minded and curious about life in general , than this book is indispensible . even if you have no intention to put the meditations into practice , there is enough worthwhile commentary in here , as in all `` osho '' books , to keep your heart open and your mind stimulated .
