the king maker stiff acting and bad special effects i thought because of the reviews mentioned here that the film was on par with crouching tiger/hidden dragon , but it definitely is not . the acting seems stiff and without any heart . the only redeeming factor is john rhys-davies , who makes as much out of his character as he could . being an american , i watched it in the original english and discovered to my amusement , that the thai dialogue was dubbed again . at first i thought that the actors might have been speaking in another language and then had it dubbed into thai , but it turned out that the actors were speaking in thai and the filmmakers decided to redub all of the thai actors ' speaking parts , which was done very badly . the special effects seem to be out of an earlier era . i nearly laughed with i saw an arrow volley that looked like it had been badly drawn onto the film . i am probably not the best critic for this film , however , since i turned it off after half an hour and was glad i only rented it . do not rent !
