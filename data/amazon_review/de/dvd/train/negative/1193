eric clapton - one more car , one more rider bored out of my ever , lovin ' skull ! ! i had high expectations for this dvd , after seeing ec in concert at the charlotte coliseum , ( charlotte , nc , usa ) during the `` reptile tour '' . in fact , the day after this particular show , he announced that this would be his last tour . those of us who attended the concert that night , had a feeling this was coming , because the last number was a soft , melencholy version of `` somewhere over the rainbow '' . ours , was one of the few venues on the tour that had an appearance by `` the impressions '' , the group which sang with him on `` reptile '' . we loved it ! ! but , this is not a concert review ; so , let 's move straight to my thoughts on the dvd , itself ... i must say , i felt monetarily violated after purchasing this dvd . first , i did n't get the feeling that clapton was into the show . it had a sort of , very-structured , `` i 'm being recorded ... better make this look good '' feel . '' unfortunately , most of the songs he performed were a re-hash of the same stuff on his last two dvd releases . how many different ways can you possibly play `` hoochie coochie man '' ? i loved it on `` live in hyde park '' . it was still , pretty good on `` ec and friends '' ( 1999 ) . but , you 've done it to death , man ! let it rest in peace , for cryin ' out loud ! than there 's `` change the world '' and `` tears in heaven '' ... .yada , yada , yada ... . yeah , we 've all heard them a gajillion times now . thank goodness he included some tracks from his new album , to offset these played-out tunes . the only reason this hideous swill is even getting 2 stars from me , is because of a couple of great songs ... first , an acoustic version of `` bell bottom blues '' . this was very nicely arranged ; adding a breath of fresh air to a timeless classic . the second song is `` somewhere over the rainbow '' ( already commented on above ) . yet , i have 2 issues with the last one ... . what the heck kind of instrument was his keyboard player using in his mouth ? that stupid thing was so stinkin ' annoying ! i wish i could have been there to literally rip the cord out of it 's socket ! ! ( wah , wah , wah , wah - oh , brother ! give me a break ! ) my other issue has to do with one of the camera angles they used . the whole dvd is this superbly , crisp , high-definition deal . and , then , on the last song , one of the camera shots is completely washed out . it 's almost as if you 're looking at the band though a blue , lense filter . what 's the deal with that ? did no one catch this ? finally , knowing that this was being recorded for video release ... why did n't he have `` the impressions '' there ? i mean , c'mon eric ! at least , then you could have performed `` do n't let me be lonely tonight '' , which was a great cover of james taylor 's song , on `` reptile '' . well , if this is the best he can do , maybe he should retire . anyway , do n't waste your money on this one . i 'll probably wind up selling mine on ebay !
