stalingrad ( special ed . - 2 dvds inkl . dokumentation ) love this film , but ... ... how can you release such a great film with remastered sound and no english subtitles ? i 've had the poor dubbed version for years , the best way to watch foreign films is in the orignal language with subtitles to get the nuances of the performance . i leapt for joy when i saw this here , but my heart sank when it arrived in the post . am i being unreasonable in thinking that english subtitles are a must for bringing a wider audience to this film ? whose bright idea was it not to bother with them ?
