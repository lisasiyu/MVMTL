the derby stallion [ uk import ] the heart of a boy . the soul of a champion . i 've bought this movie deliberately . just wanted to see if zac could play his role and show a charachter of a person who 's very different from troy bolton . no . he could n't . actually , despite being shot earlier than first high school musical movie was shown in theatres , you can see the same troy/patric in the movie , and , by and large , close story . i had expected more interesting job from zac but he failed . although those facts , the movie itself is not bad . not at all . first of all , it 's pretty kind and dramatic story where you could see not only relations between father and his son ( the well-know problem `` fathers and sons '' , described in russian classic literature and not only ) but also love story of patric and jill , patric 's goal achievment and tragedy of old lonly man , living in small provincial town . unlike zac efron , his movie partner bill cobbs has brilliantly played his role . solitude he showed was unbelievable and touching . moreover , the ending of the movie prevents excessive iridescence this story . do i recommend this movie ? more yes than no . igor . russian federation .
