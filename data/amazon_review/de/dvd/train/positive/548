bride of the monster ( omu ) the one ed wood to watch ever since he became the subject of tim burton 's biopic ed wood has been hailed as the king of z-film and his oeuvre was re-edited . tiobe perfectly honest : most of his films are bad in terms of being terribly boring . so they mostly have no entertainment value whatsoever . bride of the atom however is different . here , you get the works . people walking into doors , wobbly sets , the female actresses who obviously hate each other and a monster with a colander on its head . this is the one ed wood film you should really watch simply because it 's hilarious . so it 's ten points even though they are not for what the spiritus rector intended .
