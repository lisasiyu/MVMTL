frankenstein junior not only a classic parody but a classic in itself mel brooks ' `` young frankenstein '' is such an excellently observed piece of parody that it could fit quite easily within any collection of the universal horror cycle it so lovingly satirises as not to see the joins . unlike much of the later brooks ' works , `` young frankenstein '' contains true homage to it 's source material which though extremely funny is never dismissive . his commentary track is far from comprehensive but does allow some insight into the efforts put into making the picture the success it still continues to be when more recent mel brook 's comedies seem extremely dated .
