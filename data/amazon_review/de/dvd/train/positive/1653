manchester united - end of season review 2003/2004 [ uk import ] what a surprise ! i bought this dvd out of frustration because i would n't be able to see two of my favorite manu players perform till probably november . and wow what a lovely surprise this dvd was . over 120min . packed with action , sublime goals , interviews and much more . for any manu fan this is definitely a must . that 's what a season review dvd should be like . brilliant !
