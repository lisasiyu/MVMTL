casanova the music is one of the actors as the movie opens we approach casanova from behind as he is about to reveal a story that is not his to tell . based loosely on the known history of casanova this play takes place and is filmed in venice . it is one of those farces of mistaken identity and opportunity . everyone did an excellent portray of the characters and the time . however i must say i was very much taken by victoria ( natalie dormer ) the genoa virgin . i wonder how she makes her nostrils flair like that . and that was a cute scene when she broke the wooden bridge that was made just for that scene . aside from the great music , much of it original , there are some beautiful panoramas and sunsets . and for those that like adventure or s and m you will not be disappointed . there is even a scene with a real swinger .
