i 'm so glad i bought this film i bought the film after reading the commentaries and i 'm really glad i did . i had to stay up late until 4 in the morning watching it last night , because i just could n't stop . and now it does n't go out of my mind . `` pride and prejudice '' is my all-time-favorite , but this is one film that comes close . richard armitage is just unbelievably good in his role . the female artist does leave something to be desired , but still.. so , in short : highly recommended.. ||| i 'm so glad i bought this film i bought the film after reading the commentaries and i 'm really glad i did . i had to stay up late until 4 in the morning watching it last night , because i just could not stop . and now it does not go out of my mind `` pride and prejudice '' is my all-time favorite , but this is one film that comes close . richard armitage is just unbelievably good in his role . the female artist does leave something to be desired , but still .. so , in short : highly recommended ..
