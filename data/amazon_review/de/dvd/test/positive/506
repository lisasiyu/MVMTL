the 51st state **** good action comedy **** now this is something of a rarity , a british action comedy that actually delivers and is as good , if not better , than many of the so-called action comedies hollywood occasionally delivers . it of course stars an american , the king of cool himself samuel l jackson , it 's also part-financed by american money and it is directed by ronny yu but it 's still essentially a british movie , written by stel pavlou ( not a very british name , i know ) whilst working in an off-licence .
