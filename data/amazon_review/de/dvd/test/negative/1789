charlie daniels band - volunteer jam volunteer jam dvd i 've bought the volunteer jam dvd and i should n't have done that . it 's because i own the real volunteer jam movie on vhs . when i compared the two recordings , i immediately noticed that there were things altered in the new recording . for exemple the music does n't match with the images . there is a one second difference in sound and image . you see the drummer hitting the drums and one second or maybe less after that you hear the drums . there 's no synchronocity with sound and image . further more . the quality of the recording in the movie is far better than on the new dvd . |i 've written eagle rock enterainment about this . if you can get the real original volunteer jam movie you 're better of .
