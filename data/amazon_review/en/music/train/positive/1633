no funkin ' around funk , in its purest form , is hard to come by these days . that 's because we do n't have the kind of wreckless visionaries that the 70s had , like dr. john and george clinton . these guys were so far gone into their music that they bordered on being parodies of themselves , and somehow that translated into the kind of raw and unprecedented energy that makes their music so saturated in what one would ideally define as 'funky ' . take dr. john : the dude is basically the white george clinton , with his crazy head dresses and honky tonk muppet voice . put him in front of a piano , get the meters to lay down the tightest funk grooves you 've ever heard , and add producer alain toussaint 's canjun roots and you 've got an exceptionally enjoyable album in `` in the right place '' . the music is uplifting and listenable ; the meters take the house down with some thick bass riffs , brilliantly arranged horns and tight-as-hell percussions . dr. john wails like a drunken canjun cartoon character , which is such an endearing and appropriate compliment to this musical experience that you will not know how to listen to this kind of funk without a voice as original and funky as this . while the entire album provides a consistent line-up of quality jams , the two stand-outs that have become two of dr. john 's greatest hits are `` right place , wrong time '' and `` such a night '' . `` right place , wrong time '' would fill any dance floor with its danceability factor , while `` such a night '' is a kind of honky tonk interpretation of a faster-paced soul ballad , with great backing vocals and a nostalgic , bugsy malone-sounding keys section . this album is a must-have for any self-respecting fan of the funk . dr. john is a true pioneer in the genre and , while most of his work is worth owning , this is nonetheless one of his best albums to prove it
