excellent symphonic christmas album i was looking for arrangements of many traditional christmas carols done by orchestras . this album hits the spot . it is not uniquely orchestra carols , the canadian brass is mixed in as welll . the highlight of the album for me is the back to back track of & quot ; sleigh ride & quot ; pieces . it begins with w.a . mozart 's & quot ; sleigh ride , & quot ; followed by leopold mozart 's piece of the same name , and then finnished with the ever popular arangement of & quot ; sleigh ride & quot ; by anderson . it is a really good mix of carols , and can be listened to for hours
