millennium ~ front line assembly when i first heard this album back in 1994 , i did not like it all . i was expecting tactical neural implant part two . however , later on in life and with a much broader palate for music i must say that i love it . it was a stroke of genius to add the layer of guitars and i love the hard edged sound which sounds like a mix between ministry , fla , die krupps and even front 242 . the cover is a very odd thing that does not look like anything at all and the text is not all that great . the lyrics are interesting and they make up for the not so great vocals with plenty of energy and a tremendous tallent to make cross over music . the guitar layer is amazing and add a brutal edge to an already grimm sound . fla show on this album that they can mix and match their sound and still be able to create amazing music .
