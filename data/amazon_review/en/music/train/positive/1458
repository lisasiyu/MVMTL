wonderful undeniable groove i do not have many kenny loggins cd 's . i bought the & quot ; essentials & quot ; cd 's and then found out about this one . i am really enjoying this cd . the songs & quot ; fit & quot ; into my playlists whether i am playing only kenny loggins music or playing other artists as well . it is always good when i can mesh the music with my mood . so far i have been able to pull out this cd and find something that matched . i would have liked a few more songs
