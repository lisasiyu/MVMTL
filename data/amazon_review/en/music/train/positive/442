unbelievably good . a master guitarist , stellar songwriter and voice to die for . this is an amazing collection of all new works from not only a master guitarist and stellar songwriter ... but one of the smoothest and most amazing voices around ( for another voice this good ... see `` neil finn '' ) . even if you 've never heard of vince gill , or do n't listen to country music - buy this cd and enjoy it ( each cd is in a different style ) . i just saw him last night at the wiltern theater in los angeles and he blew my mind . he and his roughly 20 piece band were sensational . he performed 5 or 6 tracks off each of the four cds in this collection and not one of them was n't fantastic . there are n't enough good things to say about this box set of all new material
