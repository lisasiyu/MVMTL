one of my all time favorite cd's this is an excellent cd . it is fun to dance to , sing to , and drive to . it does n't matter if you like country music or not-you can enjoy keith urban 's music . even better than his cd 's are his live shows . well worth the ticket price and one of the best concerts you will see .
