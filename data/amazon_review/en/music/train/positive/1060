top notch the greatest thing about this lp is the songwriting . sexsmith writes songs about overcoming a difficult upbringing , dealing with mortality and being average . i think he tends to write too many love songs on his other albums but on other songs he creates a great diversity and depth . mitchell froom 's production is perfect for the songwriting ( it 's almost as good as kiko )
