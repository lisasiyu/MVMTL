fine second volume of obscure apple recordings ! this is the second volume of recordings of songs by writers signed to the beatles apple music publishing company . though most of the artists contributing to the cd are pretty obscure with a very limited recorded material behind them , there are a few exceptions . the iveys , who later changed their name to badfinger , are represented with four mod-inspired recordings quite unlike the material they originally released the group . though all very much time-pieces quite interesting material , with pete ham 's `` black and white rainbows '' as the strongest track . george alexander of grapefruit wrote two songs for the cd ; none of them recordings by grapefruit , but both among the strongest recordings on the cd . songwriting team gallagher and lyle wrote four songs ; three of them their own demos . quite obvious that they were already at that time great songwriters . the hollies sounding tracks `` technicolour dream '' and `` ivy unrehearsed '' are my favourites . the obscure band `` the u no who '' who later turned into `` bachdenkel '' , deliver some of the very best recordings to the cd . quite amazing that apple did not offer the band a contract . their title-track `` an apple a day '' is a very catchy song ; their music both melodic and complex . their other two at least as strong . all in all a fine collection of music from the 1968-69 psychedelic years in british pop-music .
