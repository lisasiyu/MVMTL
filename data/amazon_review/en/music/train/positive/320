great follow-up to & quot ; i just ca n't stop it & quot ; for whatever reason i bought this album much later on than the other two english beat albums - something about it & quot ; not being as good & quot ; . that 's complete nonsense . this album is excellent and it was a welcome revelation to hear it years later , after the fact as it were . there 's not a weak track on this cd . plenty of soulful saxophone solos abound . & quot ; dreamhome in nz & quot ; , & quot ; walk away & quot ; , and & quot ; monkey murders & quot ; are lost 80 's classics to go along with the better-known & quot ; doors of your heart & quot ; and & quot ; too nice to talk to & quot ; . love the alternate version of & quot ; get-a-job & quot ; found here . i rank this second beat album in the all-too-short trilogy of albums from these guys right up there next to & quot ; i just ca n't stop it & quot ; ; it 's certainly a stronger album from start to finish than & quot ; special beat service & quot ; - their final album - where the strain of not having widespread commercial acceptance sounded like it had taken its toll . looking back , i wish the english beat had stayed together long enough to record a few more gems like & quot ; wha'ppen ? & quot ; . they probably do too
