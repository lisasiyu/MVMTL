great musical the music in this musical uncannily remains faithful to abba music and the story line which was written to showcase the music . i saw the las vegas production , not the the original london production yet the music sung and played in the lv production was just as fantastic as that within the original production . if you like abba , ( and who does not ? ) and can not spring for the price of a ticket , this dvd is the next best thing
