great vocals , very good overall sound this is the first plumb cd that i have purchased . i suspect it wo n't be the last . the vocals and overall musical quality is appealing and quite catchy . the lead singer 's voice is really very good . lyrically , it is good . most of the songs are not very clearly christian . one exception is their remake of michael w. smith 's 'pray for me ' , which is great . others have lyrics that occasionally allude to christian topics such as , 'i ca n't do this ' . there is one line that says , 'i ca n't do this . i ca n't do this by myself . oh god , i need your help . ' in spite of the overall lack of christian oriented lyrics , which i prefer , there is nothing objectionable about the wording in these songs . i will likely check out another one of their cds . this one is very good and seems better each time i listen to it
