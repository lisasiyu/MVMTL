timeless probably one of the top 20 rock albums of the past 20 years , i still consider this to be pearl jam 's best album to date . possibly even pearl jam 's career defining album , which is unusual for a band to be at the absolute peak of their game on releasing their debut . penned and sung by eddie vedder , without a doubt one of rocks great vocalists , this album has a fair few of pj 's best-loved tracks . if you 're relatively new to pearl jam 's music , i would recommend you buy either this release or their greatest hits album , 'rearviewmirror : greatest hits 1991-2003 ' . fan favourites on this album are `` jeremy '' , `` alive '' , even flow '' and `` black '' . some tracks i rate highly would be `` alive '' , `` garden '' , `` jeremy '' and `` release '' . still , if you do n't fancy buying the album , at least download some of the tracks i mentioned . you wo n't be dissapointed . if you 're a fan of pearl jam you might also like the smashing pumpkins , soundgarden , audioslave , alice in chains , stone temple pilots or even nirvana . if you like this record i would highly recommend listening to 'siamese dream ' by the smashing pumpkins , or 'superunknown ' by soundgarden , which is apparently one of eddie vedder 's favourite albums
