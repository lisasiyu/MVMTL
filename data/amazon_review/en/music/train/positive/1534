this is what that `` cali iz active '' album should 've sounded like ( rating : 8 out of 10- -4 stars ) snoop dogg is one of my favorite rappers . i 've grown up listening to him since i was a child while he was rhyming on dr. dre 's `` the chronic '' . i 've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums ( `` the game is sold ... '' ) and when he dropped a decent album ( `` paid the cost ... '' ) . `` the blue carpet treatment '' would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me . this album is full of laced beats and good rhymes . `` think about it '' comes off real strong from snoop laced with a dope beat . the radio hit `` thats that ... '' with r. kelly gives listeners a nice r & b tune to listen to . as well as the other hit `` i wan na love you '' with akon , another hit for this album . as i said in my title , this is what `` cali iz active '' should have sounded like . that cd was so horrible and failed to follow it 's concept . this album followed what that concept should have been . most of the guest appearances are form cali . `` candy '' would feature goldie loc , mc eiht , e-40 , and the dogg pound , and a real nice tune to ride to . `` lax '' with ice cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from biggie 's `` going back to cali '' in the hook . i 'd say for some reason , my favorite song is toward the end with `` imagine '' with dr. dre . and d'angelo . possibly because that piano laced throughout the song . snoop would close the album with `` conversations '' with stevie wonder , showing off that he 's trying to get his mind right . other guests include the game , b-real from cypress hill , george clinton , and kam ( where the hell have you been kam ? ? ? ) . although this is a good cd i 've heard from snoop in a minute , it still has some rough parts . `` 10 lil ' crips '' sounded kinda weak to me . and i was n't feeling the song `` beatin ' up on yo pads '' although it 's a positive song about him coaching and playing football , but it 's a good song , so i 'll make it my honorable mention track . if you heard that this album was his most consistant since `` doggystyle '' , you heard correct . we 're more than aware that he 's not going to drop another one of those albums , but this is a real good one from snoop . if other west coast artists drop albums like this , we might have the west coast making a comeback . and being a fan of west coast rap music , i am more than ready for it . if you thought snoop fell off , well he gives doubters `` tha blue carpet treatment '' . lyrics : a- production : a- guest appearances : a- musical vibes : b overall : a- my favorite tracks from this album : think about it , thats that ... , candy ( drippin ' like water ) , gangbangn 101 , lax , which one of you , i wan na [ love ] you , psst ! , imagine , converstions honorable mention track : beatin ' on yo pads peace everyone ! !
