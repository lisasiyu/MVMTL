brilliant debut album ! ! ! ! ! ! thanks for reading . i 'm surprised reading some reviews that this album receives such poor comments from people . this stuff is brilliant and has awesome songs ! as usual the album is a great mix of slower and faster songs . the early line-up was great , albiet missing don felder . ( forget about walsh ) what 's remarkable for me is not the hit songs `` take it easy '' `` witchy women '' and `` peaceful easy feeling `` ( which are all wonderful songs ) it 's the other songs . some are just brilliant , including `` chug all night '' `` tryin '' and the best non single ever from the eagles `` take the devil '' mind blowing song from randy miesner . great guitar and melodies as usual . this is my second favourite eagles album , just pipped by `` one of these nights '' a must for music fans in general . this is great music ! ! ! essential for your collectio
