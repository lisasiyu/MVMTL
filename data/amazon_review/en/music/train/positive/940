blackfoot rattlesnake rock bites ! i saw them open for kiss in 76 and they blew me away . but for some reason i never bought any albums . i never heard them on the radio . i always thought they were another skynrd type band but they are not ! they are just kick butt rock and roll ! i love it ! i love the live versions so much i wan na get the live album now . reminds me of saxon or ufo live . awesome . i 'm sorry i did n't listen to them before . train train , wishing well , queenie and the kickin ' good morning are just killers ! if you think they are just some southern band think again . highly recommended for any hard blues rock fan . buy blackfoot
