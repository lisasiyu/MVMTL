near-forgotten master of jazz guitar : buy this if you can ... mr. farlow came along years before wes montgomery , and never achieved wes 's level of mass appeal . listen to this 1956 album , however , and you will be amazed . this expanded cd has 63 swinging minutes of guitar , piano and bass , but the trio sounds like a quintet at least . the old standards are recognizable , the tunes written without lyrics are interesting , and the absence of horns or drums is n't noticed at all . i wanted this when it was an lp but never got my hands on it . i have coveted it on cd the last few years , looking for a bargain price , but finally settled on something close to full retail . it 's worth it . enjoyable all the way through , i could see how a real guitar lover might declare this to be his favorite jazz disc ever . i expect to hear this one a lot over the next year or two , and to be fully satisfied . read the other reviews posted here for & quot ; why & quot ; it works , and & quot ; how & quot ; tal was so good . as a non-musician , all i can say is & quot ; this one is great fun and what 50 's jazz was all about. & quot
