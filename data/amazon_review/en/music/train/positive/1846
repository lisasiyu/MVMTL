suga free , problem free this is a very solid debut . a unique style of flow that seperates him from the pack , but easy to bang . hes hot . production is q-u-i-k no c so u know its bangin . lyrically this cat is a west koast phenom and highly underrated . for the majority of the album the feel is reminiscent of quiks ground breaking `` tonite '' . very close to being a classic . my reviews are for those close to the streets so if this isnt u dont be surprised if u dont agree . 6x9 b down or get klowne
