a great compilation , with a few 'classics ' missing decca has put together a wide range of early jazz from a bunch of different artists ; some with tracks you would not expect , which i suspect may have been intentional , the dates vary from 1929-1959 , but the latter date is a bit misleading ( see track list ) . there is no & quot ; modern & quot ; jazz here . it is also a self-admitted limited survey , due to the label . men like ben webster and johnny hodges are not represented due to the fact that no solos from any decca , or decca owned subsidiary , were deemed proper examples of either . but what is included is always classic , even if not the most obvious candidate for the artist . making up for any shortcomings in that regard is the 79 page booklet included , which is really half the presentation . well done , informative , and richly packaged , it is a great companion to the disc , and a great gift idea for a jazz aficianado
