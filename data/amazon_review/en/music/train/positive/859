a-z cool owning most of their output , this is my favorite , followed by `` mirror conspiracy '' and then `` cosmic game '' . re-mixed tunes from obscure ( to me ) artists segue into one another for over an hour 's musical world tour , thievery-style . their musical perspective explores the best elements of each choice , moving on at the perfect time to keep you interested and wanting more . unlike a lot of cds , this set stays strong towards the end ! stand outs : 'international flight' 'sea groove' 'cramp your style' 're-return of the original artform' 'expo in tokyo' 'my french brother' super-nice artwork and cover treatments . take this to a party only if you never want to see it again
