snake farm-tastic i thought `` delirium tremolos '' was the ultimate display of ray wylie hubbard 's style & talent , then i listened to `` snake farm '' . wow ! i did n't think rwh 's essence could be distilled down any further after `` dt '' , but with `` snake farm '' i was hooked from the first riff & did n't come up for air until the cd changer kicked in at the end . this stuff is 100 proof hubbard . honey , it 's all good , down to the last drop
