still a lot of `` country '' on this crossover album in the 1990s , the country music began to go through some transitions . country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music . as a result , the sound started to change . one artist that led this transition was faith hill . faith hill had previously released two albums , but it was her 1998 breakthrough album `` faith '' that helped her break into mainstream music . surprisingly , while `` faith '' did cross-over into the mainstream , there still is a strong country element on this album . by no means do i consider myself a country music expert . the nice thing about `` faith '' is that i believe it caters to a fan like myself that may not be deep into country music , but can appreciate many of the elements country music can bring to the table . while `` faith '' could be directed to a more casual fan like myself , i think the collection does an admirable job at addressing the fan who is deeper when it comes to the country music genre . faith hill brings an interesting formula to this album . faith 's role on the collection is primarily of vocalist . since she is focused on vocals , she is dependent on a solid cast of characters ( musicians and songwriters ) to support her effort . on `` faith '' , this does n't appear to be a problem . she is surrounded by many top notch studio musicians and is given an oustanding slate of songs to work with . given this solid infrastructure , faith is able to provide stellar vocals and produce a great product . the interesting twist to this formula is that faith hill is a co-producer on all 12 songs . therefore she just is n't a `` vocalist for hire '' . she ultimately is deciding what the songs should be and how the final product should sound . this is why `` faith '' is a solid collection . `` this kiss '' was the song that made faith hill a household name on the mainstream music scene . this was also the song that was my first introduction to faith hill . in 1998 , i first heard this song on the radio and it completely blew me away . one reason why this song made it into the mainstream arena is that it does have qualities that make it sound like a `` pop '' song . however , there is a true country element to this song - complete with steel guitar and fiddle ( played by glen duncan ) . this instrumentation gives the song a most unique flavor . the song features some very clever and catchy lyrics such as `` it 's a centrifugal motion ; it 's perpetual bliss ; it 's that pivotal moment '' . the vocals are delivered with a very up-tempo pace ( with little rests between the words ) and that also contribute to the unique flavor . this song features some great background vocals by chris rodriguez ( who provides background vocals on several other songs on the album ) and beth nielson chapman ( who is a co-writer for this song ) . at first , upon purchasing `` faith '' , i expected it would basically be `` this kiss '' and not much else . however , after my first listen to this collection - i realized that this was not the case . there were many other terrific songs that are included on this collection . the second song `` you give me love '' is also pretty catchy . this has much more of a country element on this song . this song is highlighted by some terrific drums and more fiddle by glen duncan . although not as catchy a song , `` let me let go '' is worth mentioning . the highlight of this particular song is background vocals by vince gill . gill is a master in the domain of steering country music toward the mainstream , but not abandoning the country music element . this song clearly has a country element and it works . this song also features a string section of viola players . the country music element is alive and well in the song `` better days '' . this song was co-written by former fleetwood mac vocalist billy burnette . this song also features duncan 's fiddle . the country music element is also present in the song `` my wild frontier '' . this is a powerful and sad song about a woman , who with her family moves into the canadian prairie . tragedy then strikes when the woman 's baby son dies in his sleep . this song is a great example of some of how a very well written song is made even better by some very emotional and powerful vocals by faith . the best song on the album is `` the secret of life '' . this song was co-written by gretchen peters , who is a songwriter that worked with bryan adams on `` on a day like today '' and his `` unplugged '' album . the song is about exactly what the title says - telling little bits on what `` the secret of life is '' . no loss of a solid country feel in this song - including more great fiddle by duncan . simple lyrics like `` the secret of life is in sam 's martini '' ( sam is a character that is referred to in the song ) or `` the secret of life is a good cup of coffee '' give this song a very special quality . two other country element songs are that are solid are `` just to hear you say that you love me '' and `` the hard way '' . in `` just to hear you say you love me '' , faith does a terrific duet with her husband tim mcgraw . as for `` the hard way '' , this is very powerful song ( more great fiddle ) and is best described by the lyrics `` i keep livin and lovin and learnin the hard way '' . finally , `` me '' is another good song - this song has more of a pop element and deals with a woman changing who she is . on a side note , sheryl crow is a co-writer of `` somebody stand by me '' . not a great song , but worth mentioning . all of the lyrics , studio musicians , songwriting and production credits are listed in the liner notes . this album should appeal to country music and mainstream fans . highly recommended
