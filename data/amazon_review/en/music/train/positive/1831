another williams masterpiece if you watch -- and listen to -- enough movies , you can almost name the composer of certain scores , they 're so similar . john barry 's scores to & quot ; dances with wolves , & quot ; & quot ; out of africa , & quot ; and & quot ; somewhere in time & quot ; ( except for the rachmaninoff ) , are like that . james horner 's scores are a little better differentiated . but the two best , able to write evocative scores that capture the essence of the film 's story and make us feel it -- without leaving us thinking we 've heard this before -- are jerry goldsmith ( e.g. , & quot ; the sandpebbles & quot ; ) and john williams . here , like goldsmith 's score to & quot ; the wind and the lion , & quot ; williams is able to take a truly exotic motif -- the musical forms of west africa -- and mix it with truly american , if a little copland-esqe-sounding , music . and that 's the whole idea . people were violently ripped from their homes and transported to , for them , a place no less alien and bizarre than africa was to white europeans and americans . and yet the united states was a place that declared & quot ; all men are created equal. & quot ; the contemplative , high-principle-sounding music to & quot ; mr. adams takes the case , & quot ; is as stirring as the exotic & quot ; dry your tears , afrika , & quot ; but in a completely different way . that john williams is able to do that in score after score is what makes him one of the all-time greatest in a genre that has n't been around all that long . my only wish is that film score composers would more often produce true , symphonic suites from their film scores that can be played by orchestras as stand-alone , concert pieces . i hope this music becomes such a suite . like the subject matter of the movie -- the eternal human quest for freedom and equality -- it would become timeless
