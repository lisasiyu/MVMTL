holy cow ! i got this cd almost exactly a year after hearing & quot ; not pretty enough & quot ; on a sampler cd i got from purchasing a present for someone . i immediatly fell in love with the song , mainly because it put my feelings into words about someone . after listening to the one song for a year , my boyfriend finally got me barricades and brickwalls for christmas . it 's awesome , and i 'm listening to it now ! her voice is amazing , with a touch of breathiness that adds to the overall effect . the lyrics are another thing , so thoughtfully written out and sung from her own heart . she actually wrote the songs herself . i 've never been a country fan , but the cd is making me change my view ( very slowly ! ) . i love this girl
