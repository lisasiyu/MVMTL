flyleaf is so awesome ! ! ! i bought their ep cd yesterday , i was going to buy their full album but i did n't have enough money and then i saw the ep cd was cheaper , so i just had to buy it . i liked flyleaf before i had their cd because i knew the songs `` i 'm so sick '' and `` fullyalive '' i 've seen , the fully alive video on sky angel ( a christian channel ) before , and the video is awesome ! i love all the songs on this cd , my favorite is of course `` fully alive '' and `` red sam '' , and `` i 'm so sick '' , i love all of the songs though , i ca n't wait to buy their full cd next time , knowing me i will always love listening to their cd ! i love this band , they are better than evanescence ! i highly recommend that you buy this cd , and the debut cd ! i ca n't wait til their next cd comes out ! and lacey mosley , does really good in her singing and she can yell in the songs too , she 's awesome ! fly leaf rocks
