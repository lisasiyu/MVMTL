words can not express where to begin ? to put it as briefly as possible , if you 're an adventurous music listener you will not be disappointed by blueberry boat . this is the most inventive work i 've heard since radiohead 's kid a . ( no small feat ) . every style you could imagine is carefully melded into one , including the most wonderfully bizzare lyrics i have ever heard . no sense discussing every track ad nauseam , each individual will form their own opinions . i can only give this my highest and most urgent recommendation . pay no mind to the impatient simps who give this album one star and call it `` the worst of all time . '' sit down with blueberry boat ; listen to it as many times as you have to . those who *get* this musical gift from the friedbergers will fall in love . give it a chance and you may be pleasantly surprised
