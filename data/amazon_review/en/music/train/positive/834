cub koda could really rock ! ! ! ( rest in peace man ) this album contains the classic rock song `` smokin ' in the boy 's room '' which a lot of my peers did back in high school.back then they used to smoke filter cigarettes . sadly these days the filter cigarettes have now been replaced with a more potent addictive drug . anyway back to the album . the guitarist and singer of this band cub koda was a wild man of rock who was always great to watch in action as he jumped from one place to another on stage . they do n't make them like him anymore . this album rocks so play it loud and forget about the neighbours ! ! !
