the sixth dimension you 'll probably recognize grazing in the grass as the backround music from that tv commercial with the chinese-american lady from the view . i forget whether its for khakis or golf , and i most certainly do n't watch the view , but this is great music . - - you might remember issac hayes making fun of the million mile an hour & quot ; i can dig it & quot ; conjugations in & quot ; i 'm gon na get you sucka & quot ; - -my point is , they 're songs like kung fu fighting and a lot of tunes in those gap commercials ... you may not have actually bought the album or even know the words ( personally , i have a sealed copy of kung fu ) , but if you 're a certain age , you you 're bound to remember them or perk up when you hear them . i tend to think of this group as kind of a slightly more soulful take off on the fifth dimension . when i 'm in the mood i like both groups . they are cheery yet soulful at the same time . while grazing was their big hit , i 'd have to say the winner for me is love or let me be lonely ... especially the way it starts out all slow and dramatic then goes into that brassy uptempo part . - - anyway , these songs make great listening ( and sometimes backround music ) for the key of life . for sure they were definitely the & quot ; have a nice day/*smile* & quot ; side of the '70s . i would definitely reccomend exploring them
