an album for the middle of the day on saturaday or cruising this is a great album with an insane amount of energy that if you listen to it . . .right before you go out for the night , run errands , take a long drive , then this is the album that is a necessity in a music collection . though too much of a good thing , is never a good thing , so moderate intake with the previous album . switch it up , go crazy , do whatever just do something . i got ta run some errands now
