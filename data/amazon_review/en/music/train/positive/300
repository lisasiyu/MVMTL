gently overwhelming time without consequence is one of those albums . one of the ones that you can put into your cd player and just feel completely enveloped by the music . the quiet , gentle intensity of this album is just outstanding . murdoch seems to be singing/playing so effortlessly and at the same time pouring his entire soul into the music . it is a dichotomy that is present throughout the entire album and it works extremely well . the comparisons between murdoch and nick drake are valid , and that is actually the first time i 've said that , which is amazing considering how many artists people compare to nick drake . the biggest similarity between the two is the quiet intensity they bring to their music . but murdoch goes beyond nick drake in the sense that he is not just a drake clone , and his songs showcase murdoch 's own identity and direction . i wo n't go into individual songs , because i 'm sure others will review the album song by song . i 'll just say that i although i have my favorites , there are n't any bad songs on this album . all the songs are quality pieces of music and none deserve to be skipped over . this will probably be the top album of the year for me , and it is definitely the best i 've heard so far . great music .
