experimental joni sometimes i still ca n't believe the constant quality of joni mitchell 's discography from the early days in 1968 up until 1980 . mitchell released several masterpieces , not only the well-known blue and court & spark , but also the 'transitional ' albums for the roses annd hissing of summer lawns can be marked as totally perfect works of art as far as i 'm concerned . from there on things got less accesible but actually even more interesting , as mitchell plunged into the depths of jazz , classical and even african music on don juan 's reckless daughter . the album takes some time to get used to , but the end-result is a flawed yet fully satisfying album like blue . here mitchell just went through the roof and shamelessly recorded an african drum-and-chant piece ( the tenth world ) , awkward minimalist-music ( the gorgeous dreamland ) and a 16-minute song that packed folk , jazz and classical into one mindblowing piece called paprika plains . the other songs continue where hejira ended , most notably the lovely jericho and talk to me . the endresult is simply a fantastic record , that many people had problems with upon the original time of release . too experimental , too weird , too out-there . that may be , but fact is that don juan 's reckless daughter stands as joni mitchell 's most interesting and boldy innovative work . ever .
