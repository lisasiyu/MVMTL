fire coming out of ya speaker as a devoted jigga fan , this album was everything and above what i expected . every track from beginning to last consist of stellar production with complex rhymes . jay shows off his wide array skills and versatillity with backshots at nas ( takeover ) , radio cuts ( i.z.z.o ) , emotional wordplay ( song cry ) . highlights include `` girls , girls , girls '' , `` never change '' , and is topped off with `` renegade '' which in my opinion contains hip-hop 's greatest verse of the past 10 years by eminem . even the bonus tracks would be leads for the next rapper . jay has been called commercial , but who ever says that ai n't listening .
