spare me the down talk . this is an awesome band , and they 've realeased an awesome cd . so it 's not the most technical stuff . it has atmospehere . but ok , let 's bash a band because their music has higher meaning than just cool sounds and constant head bangning . while there are some headbanging tracks on here , a lot of it is about the atmosphere . somehow this music can sound very depressing but with in the same song gives you a sense of hope . it 's a very different sound . probably an aquired sound
