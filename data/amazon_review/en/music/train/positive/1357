the best songs are there only die hard fans of gershwin should buy the massive songbook ella and nelson riddle made in 1959 , because the great songs are all included here.back in those days , gershwin was still considered the best american composer , probably because he was the only one who tried the classical experience and succeeded , and also because of the fact that he died young.nowadays we know that richard rodgers and johnny mercer are the deserving legends of american popular music.having said that let me say that this collection is perfect , it 's really the best.personal favorites of mine are someone to watch over me and but not for me.even the guy from texas should enjoy that one
