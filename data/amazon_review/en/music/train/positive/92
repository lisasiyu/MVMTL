great follow up album i dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to the killers new sound and look , i for one love it ! by the 3rd time i heard the album , i knew there was no way i 'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time , just like hot fuss . the songs are great , the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection .
