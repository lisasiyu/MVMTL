supa ! i picked this cd up after hearing a single freestyle from a mixtape like 2 years before this dropped and knew i had to have it . im so pleased w/ this album ( and all of supas music ) that everytime i listen to it i like it a little more . one of those cds you can just pop in and listen till it 's over . i just got deadline in the mail today and it 's not even in the same league as this album and still better than most cds ive listened to this year . you can see how he really strives for greatness and is constantly evolving . a true masterpeice and future classic
