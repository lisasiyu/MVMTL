fave jazz album ! every tune is fab ! thankfully , the remastering has not diminished the old scratchy sound typically found in recordings from this era . this is why i hate most modern jazz . this has genuine feeling , a raw sound , natural flow , and catchy licks -- things lacking these days , imo . pick this up if you are not a huge jazz collector , but just wish to add something worthwile to your otherwise ecclectic collection of music
