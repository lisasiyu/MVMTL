a slice of texas texas is home to many different musical styles , and adolph hofner is one of those artists who seems to capture nearly every one of them in his recordings . what strikes me is that while many would label his music as & quot ; diverse , & quot ; hofner would probably have just called it & quot ; music. & quot ; the fact that hofner is not well known and celebrated nationally puzzles me , for i believe he is one of the great texas recording artists of all time , which puts him in grand company
