what fla should be only gay song here is victim of a criminal . everything else makes for a complete album with some real winners like liquid separation , plasma springs , sex offender , and this faith . in my opinion the essence of fla lies in gashed senses & crossfire , state of mind and tni , but millennium is just a killer cd regardless of who put it out . if you 're new to fla and this is the only one you have heard and you like the style then you might not like other fla before this release . i think they tried to evolve millennium into later releases but failed . its one of those cd 's so good it was probably an accident . :
