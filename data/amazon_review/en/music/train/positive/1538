irresistible nicolette -- catchy , sexy , fun if you 're a big fan of that 'laidback '70s california pop-rock sound ' ( and who in the right mind is n't ? ) , then the late nicolette larson 's 1979 album `` in the nick of time '' is an album you should definitely have in your collection . this was nicolette 's follow up to her debut album , 1978 's `` nicolette '' , and it 's actually a better album , easing off of the sappy balladry & country/ western fluff that takes up a painful amount of space on `` nicolette '' in favor of infectious , no-nonsense pop-rock . although `` in the nick of time '' is a bit on the short side and has a few less-than-great tracks , it 's largely a splendid album . nicolette 's fun , innocently sexy presence and her irresistible , husky vocals are on full display on a bunch of ultra-catchy tracks including a couple disco-flavored tunes with `` dancin ' jones '' and `` breaking too many hearts '' , the driving , riffy pop-rocker `` just in the nick of time '' , & `` daddy '' which has a piano-and-vocal barroom-style prelude before kicking into that good ol ' california sound . also great is the breezy , feel-good ballad `` fallen '' , & the somewhat bossa-nova-flavored `` rio de janeiro blue '' ( which is suspiciously , and strikingly , reminiscent of steely dan 's `` your gold teeth '' , especially with that little lick that appears at 1:56 of the track ) . `` back in my arms again '' , a motown cover , is n't exactly a great song in the first place , but it 's given an agreeably energetic performance . the cover of karla bonoff 's `` is n't it always love '' is nicely done , though it 's quite similar to karla 's own version & not as strong , & the album ends in limp fashion with the dorky little feat cover `` trouble '' which is quite annoying . the biggest hit to come from the album was the duet with michael mcdonald `` let me go , love '' which is a splendid , soothing ballad . as with the previous & subsequent albums , this one was produced by ted templeman , & it seems he & nicolette were an ideal match . if all you have by nicolette is her compilation cd `` the very best of nicolette larson '' on rhino records and you think it 's all you need of her , think again -- the only track from `` in the nick of time '' included on there is `` let me go , love '' . originally released in october of 1979 on warner bros. , a big thumbs up to wounded bird records for reissuing this highly recommended album on cd in february of 2005 -- the sound quality on this version is phenomenal . wounded bird commonly releases two-fers , i.e . cds with two albums on 1 disc ; it would have been perfectly logical to pair this album with her first album `` nicolette '' -- they would easily fit on a single cd -- but it 's still a pleasure to see that they 've been re-released , and hopefully these reissues will help to introduce new listeners and remind old listeners of the numerous gems these albums contain . for any nicolette fan , `` in the nick of time '' is unquestionably a must-have .
