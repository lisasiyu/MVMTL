very good cd , i recommend it to any serious pop music collector ! this cd has a `` catch '' : the surprisingly beautiful voice of leigh nash . i am usually reluctant to hits covers , but in this case i would suggest to give a special try to sntr performance of the la 's `` there she goes '' , crowded house 's superhit `` do n't dream it 's over '' , and even abba 's `` dancing queen '' . special mention to that wonderful tune titled `` kiss me '' . leigh nash 's voice reinvents these songs and provides a new dimension to the meaning of `` cover version '' . believe me ... this cd is a serious improvement for your music collection !
