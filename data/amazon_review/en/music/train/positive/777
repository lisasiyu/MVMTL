effortless grace . most singers have to scream from mountaintops to be heard . others have to strategically position themselves to be taken seriously . but maysa leak , vocalist of the underexposed incognito , has a grace that oozes so effortlessly , that her peers must be scrambling to wonder how she 's able to do it . her solo debut is n't going to make anyone forget about incognito , but it 's a solid album that shows that she 's able to stand on her own . the disc is a mix of jazz-laced soul that never makes leaps and bounds to make a statement ( heads up , alicia keyes ) and does n't stray too far from her past work with incognito . like a kite on a windy october afternoon , it soars with ease . favorte tracks of mine are & quot ; black heaven , & quot ; & quot ; can we change the world ? , & quot ; and & quot ; peace of mind. & quot ; maybe , one day , the mainstream will catch up with maysa and find out what it has been missing for all these years
