jewel of hari is a convoluted surprise of joy and freedom~ this is my favorite of her two albums and one of my favorite cds in my entire collection . i love devitional music , and this album is totally upbeat with tastefully interwoven flamenco guitar , indian percussion , tablas , among more modern sounding back-beats , and dance grooves . perfect for meditation , yoga , and even just getting inspired . to me this album has a whole lot of aries/libra balance about it . it has a very freedom love feeling about it and yet it is very clear , balanced and awake . this album , i hated the first time i listened to it ! so i sold it . the second time i listened to it , i was absoluetly shocked to love it , and it is now one of my most favorite albums , and more frequently listened to , without ever getting sick of it . maybe that is how i love it so much . somehow this album merged with me in a non-conscious way , and totally snuck up on me ! wow , a very magical abum of peace and freedom in devotional modern style~ very very highly recommended .
