blast from the past i can vividly remember when this type of music was `` new '' now it 's just very collectable . of the steamroller set i loved number 1 and this one . help us and save us i had the record albums . granted , the cover pctures were more enjoyable back then . aside from sentiment it is still lively music . buy one now
