a haunting and invigorating album syd barrett 's first solo album is very different from his work with pink floyd.it is much more haunting and sad than the whimsical `` the piper at the gates of dawn '' , yet it still contains psychedelic elements . the lyrics are poignant , meaningful , and haunting . `` late night '' `` dark globe '' `` long gone '' and `` terrapin '' all have beutiful instrumentation and haunting lyrics.on `` no good trying '' and `` no mans land '' , barrett 's madness comes through , but in a way that adds an excellent tinge of psychedelica . `` golden hair '' is a beutiful setting of a poem , while `` octopus '' is a fun , invigorating , whimsical , and intriquing song.not all is good though , it features the horrible songs `` feel '' `` if i'ts in you '' and `` she took a long cold look '' . they fall apart and they are out of tune.these hardly matter though , and this is an excellent album with many things you woud n't expect from a crazy , drug addicted man
