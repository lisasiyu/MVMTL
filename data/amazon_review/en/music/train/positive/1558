7.5/10 _in the fishtank_ is an ongoing venture of an independent record company that allows the free exchange of musical ideas between ( usually ) two bands . ultimately , the _fishtank_ delivers exactly what it promises : a veritable fusion of the bands in question to create a sound that in itself is unique , but could also realistically ( though far-fetched perhaps ) fit in with any of the individual artists ' other recordings . the bands involved with this volume of _fishtank_ are isis and aereogramme , two bands that have some overlapping qualities , but are n't exactly the same by any means . this is the first and only _fishtank_ volume i have heard as of yet , but it is apparently a great success on more than one level . `` low tide '' starts with a tender , echoing melody that sprouts like an elaborately blooming plant . the reverberating music seems to lean more towards the style of isis , but the singer of aereogramme handles the vocals . my first impression was that the vocals sounded a bit like maynard james keenan 's quivering falsetto . just a bit . well maybe a bit more than a bit . either way , they sounded good . the track builds up with a pulsing bass line and industrial rhythm then calmly dissipates into the vast void of the sea . `` delial '' gets off to a heavier start , and the hollow vocals of isis ' turner become shrouded in a driving rhythm that evolves into an abrasive screech . the third track , `` stolen '' is more relaxed , with an extremely peaceful orchestration forming the bulk of the song , which trails off into an ambient mix of synths and natural sound effects . the _fishtank_ concept is a good idea , and it provides a bridge of discovery for fans of both bands involved . for having only two days to produce the songs , i 'd say both bands did a great job . i would also say that both fanbases will enjoy this , and for the price , it is another good impulse buy if you 're looking for something new . actually , i recommend getting all three albums in the isis/aereogramme trilogy that i have reviewed , along with _in the absense of truth_ and _seclusion_ , and listening to them in succession with the _fishtank_ in their midst . all else aside , this volume has prompted me to seek out the others
