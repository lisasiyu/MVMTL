even in his 50s , he 's still the rock-musician say what you want about bruce `` getting old '' , but i strongly believe that this album ( which showcases bruce in his late-40s/early-50s ) puts many rockers half-his-age to shame . all the songs are great , especially the ones that are re-arranged , such as `` the river . '' for a special treat , bruce throws in the rarity , `` do n't look back . '' and yet , of all the songs on this live album , i believe the most impressive is bruce 's acoustic version of `` born in the u.s.a. '' , where bruce plays an acoustic 12-string . for those of you who have tracks , but not this , trust me when i say linyc 's version of `` bitusa '' makes tracks ' acoustic version look like nothing . one warning : though i personally have no qualms about the song-selections , some of you who want to hear the `` staples '' ( i.e . `` the promised land '' ) might be dissapointed . and yet , when it comes to preferences of bruce-fans , the term `` to each his own '' is definetely applicable . is it an extensive treasure-trove of live performances a la live 1975-1985 ? no . is it worth it nonetheless ? yes
