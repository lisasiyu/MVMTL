fantastic this album took me awhile to get into , but it really is fantastic . none of the songs have lyrics , it 's all about the electric guitar . some of the songs jam , and some are more mellow , beautiful peices . there are a couple duds that i never listen to ( namely , `` trundrumbalind '' and `` raspberry delta jam-v '' , and `` up in the sky '' i also usually skip ) , but the rest of the songs are fantastic . `` train of angels '' is the best of the bunch , along with `` love thing '' ( gorgeous ) . `` time '' is also a fantastic , dreamy track , `` a piece of liquid '' is relaxing and sounds like something you 'd listen to in the caribbean before it goes into some cool `` night-time-sounding '' soloing . it 's impossible not to tap your feet during `` psycho monkey '' or `` house full of bullets '' , and i love the awesome playing at 1:40 in `` secret prayer '' . `` with jupiter in mind '' and `` crystal planet '' are great space-themed rockers , and `` lights of heaven '' is one of joe 's best . if you only buy one satriani album , i first and formost recommend the electric anthology and surfing with the alien , but then i also recommend you pick up crystal planet , and time machine ( not the most consistent album , but there are some here that you simply ca n't miss )
