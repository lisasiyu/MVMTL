completely thrilled me and surprised me ! usually i 'm not the greatest gloria estefan fan , but this cd utterly won me over ! i 'm not a super english gloria estefan fan , but her spanish cd 's have captivated my heart . when i decided to buy this cd , i was waiting for your typical dance music . i was really glad to hear good spanish music because now a days we lack that . every time i hear it ( whether i 'm doing homework , easy listening , or reading ) i want to be cuban ( de la patria ) and dance salsa forever ! she moves me-if not her , then definitely her music/orchestra . beautifully arranged , perfect timing , and a glorious attack of cuban beat/rhythm/love/spice/energy ! ! ! after this cd , i bought all her other spanish cd 's immediately ( like mi tierra and abriendo puertas ) but nonetheless , this cd ( alma caribena ) beats them all ! :
