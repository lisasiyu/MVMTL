much better album to round out his shows just saw the `` kid '' the other night and the tracks he played from long time coming blew the house away . what is missing on the studio versions are the blistering ( understatement ) leads he incorporated . the title track and give me up again both earned well deserved standing ovations . i ca n't wait for a live album . myself , i just mixed a cd incorporating the best of all three albums and long time coming makes it an all around great listen .
