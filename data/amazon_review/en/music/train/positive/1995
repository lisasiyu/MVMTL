do n't expect hip hop & you 'll be fine ... reading all these reviews , you 've got a whole buncha people bashing on this cd because it 's a dance album . well , to all you that do n't know norman cook , aka fatboy slim is in fact a dance artist who produces dance music , do n't go into this album expecting anything different . mr. cook is a genious and his singles time & time again are proven not only to be sucessful , but also timeless ( aside from the tracks that the top 40 radio djs get ahold of and cram down our throats a zillion times until we never wan na hear 'em again ... thanks for that by the way , you 're doing the world a great service ) . as far as not understanding `` star 69 '' , ; what is there to understand . `` star 69 '' was made for one reason & one reason only , to make you shake your butt . if you 're looking for meaning in music , go listen to yanni , or enya , or celine dion , only listen to fatboy if you wan na boogie to the mfin ' oogie . as far as the guy bashin ' `` bird of prey '' , it 's jim morrison dude ; what more do you need . for those of you who do n't know musicians outside of the backseat boys , jim 's the lead singer from the doors , & one of the few truely brilliant musicians of ours any other generation ... ever . basically i 'll put it like this , do n't bash on the man because you 're to sheltered to understand good music unless it 's played for you twice every hour on the hour on the radio or mtv . cook 's music 'll be around alot longer than any one of your 1 hit wonder 's out there . just because norman makes his own music , & not from some mold given to him by some slimey record executive does n't mean his music is bad . if you do n't get it fine , but do n't bash on something just because you 're to shallow or close minded to understand . open your ears and give it a shot , your brain will thank you
