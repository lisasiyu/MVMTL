a gem that shines brighter with each listen carbon leaf 's sound continues to evolve , and the results are outstanding . the band says it has given up trying to `` define '' its style of music , since it 's a shifting blend of so many influences and original ideas . in the past , carbon leaf has played variations of rootsy folk-rock with celtic , bluegrass , and alt-pop flourishes . this new album is focused more on a clean but no less impressive , straightforward pop-rock sound that 's catchy without being cloying , radio-friendly without being superficial . even with this focus , there 's excellent variety : `` block of wood '' has a gorgeous country-rock lilt , for example , while `` international airport '' flirts with jazz . all in all , this is a polished gem that deserves to be the band 's breakout album . the songs range from engaging ( `` bright lights , '' `` love loss hope repeat '' ) to anthemic ( `` learn to fly , '' `` comfort '' ) to heartbreaking ( `` block of wood '' ) to humorous ( `` a girl and her horse '' ) to profound ( `` the war was in color '' ) . if you enjoy infectious melodies , stunning harmonies , thought-provoking and often bittersweet lyrics , beautiful instrumentation , and pristine , finely crafted production , you will love this album . there are acoustic rhythm guitars aplenty , neatly embellished with subtle electric guitar riffs and fills ( terry clark and carter gravatt ) , anchored by a killer rhythm section ( jordan medas on bass and scott milstead on drums ) and some touches of mandolin ( gravatt again ) . this album also has a bit more keyboard work than some of carbon leaf 's earlier releases , courtesy of guest musician tim lauer . soaring above it all is the clear , resonant and at times hypnotic voice of lead singer barry privett , who also writes all of the band 's lyrics . this is my favorite release of 2006 so far , along with `` ganging up on the sun '' by guster . both new and longtime fans of carbon leaf have much to celebrate with `` love , loss , hope , repeat .
