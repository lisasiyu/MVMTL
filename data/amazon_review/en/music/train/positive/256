blew my mind i 've been listening to chris cornell for about two years , after discovering him in audioslave . then i heard `` black hole sun '' and `` spoonman '' and after that more or less forgot about soundgarden . my friend lent me this cd one day and i forgot about it for a month or two and finally listened to it yesterday and well ... wow . first off , chris cornell has one of the strongest , most recognizable voices in rock and he has such range it 's amazing . these songs are all hard , raw , catchy , and all have a great guitar & drum sound . `` outshined '' is probably my favorite soundgarden song of all time . no rock fan should pass this up : 1 . rusty cage-5/5-one of my favorite soundgarden songs . it 's fu**ing great ; chris cornell hits some great notes too . 2 . outshined-5/5-fu**ing killer ! the chorus is catchy as hell . 3 . slaves & bulldozers-5/5-chris cornell has an awesome screaming voice . this song has some good lyrics , guitar solo is good , and matt cameron 's drumming stands out . 4 . jesus christ pose-5/5-i do n't know what this song is about , but it kicks a $ $ . the music ( guitar & drumming anyway ) is really good . 5 . face pollution-5/5-great title , the song is ok . the shortest song on the album . i know i 'm probably hallucinating but it sounds like maynard james keenan ( lead singer of tool ) is singing gibberish at the end . 6 . somewhere-5/5-the most harmonious song on the album , but there 's still some `` screamage '' . 7 . searching with my good eye closed-5/5-the opening of the song with a man naming animals and what they say and finally stating `` the devil sounds like this '' and then cornell begins singing is great . really good lyrics too . 8 . room a thousand years wide-4/5-the music is good , but the vocals are kind of overshadowed by the music ; hence 4/5 9 . mind riot-5/5-easily has the least amount of screaming of any of the songs . cornell sings the song perfectly . 10 . drawing flies-5/5-lyrics are good . 11 . holy water-5/5- ( no comment ) 12 . new damage-5/5-one of the best on the album . the album goes out with a bang !
