the way this song was supposed to sound i 'm astounded at the number of people that think that an upbeat lovesong like this is supposed to be sung with a voice that conveys angst . gritty is putting it mildly , the album version of this song sounds like chad kroeger has bronchitis.. curiously enough it sounds very similar to an audio file that 's been run through a heavy sound compression codec , which is to say distorted and overall harsh . i 'm certain that this is the version that santana would have wanted on the album , but alex band of the calling just is n't as big a name as chad kroeger of nickleback , they needed big names to sell it . so they recorded this altogether better version to play on the radio and in the video to make people think that 's what they were getting on the full cd , then pulled a fast one and delivered the bronchitis special edition instead . on the other hand as the other reviews have suggested , if you liked the album version , if you honestly believe that a love song is supposed to be sung with angst.. and.. er.. grit.. then the cd single is probably not for you
