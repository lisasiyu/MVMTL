good tunes just keep on coming from ocms after the profound impact of the david rawlings produced `` o.c.m.s. , '' to my music collection , my pre-order of `` big iron world '' came with pretty high expectations . i 've listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail last night and though it does n't sport tracks with the immediate staying power of `` wagon wheel , '' `` big iron world '' does pull some wonderfully surprising punches . though he does n't capture ocms 's live act at it 's fullest ( and who really could ) , rawlings ' production once again manages to maintain ocms 's authenticity and pushes their `` old-time '' music into the modern area , without a hint of the tacky , over-produced , artificial , gimmicks , heard on other neo-bluegrass records . `` big iron world '' is not an album stuck in history , or looking to bite of the accomplishments of the past . with `` big iron world , '' ocms once again displays its own sound , pushing the limits of bluegrass/county/rock/punk/folk forward , while paying its respect and harkening back to the fables of woody guthrie , the picking of muleskinner and the late 60 's albums of dylan . moreover , the songs of `` big iron world '' comprise a complete body of work . the pro-union , `` union maid '' and folksy `` james river blues '' are the standout tracks on an album that works as a whole , with each song complementing the next . as with all of ocms 's albums , `` big iron world '' is a breath of fresh air in comparison to most other albums put out by artists of a similar age . they have put together a great collection of songs to be enjoyed by fans of numerous genres .
