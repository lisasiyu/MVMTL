standout van go gan is excellent . i 'd been waiting many months to recieve this cd and was thrilled and surprised once it arrived . every song is strong in it 's arrangements and vocals . in my estimation every track is interesting but with `` kiss life '' , `` international '' , `` sunrise sunset '' being standouts . this cd also contains a unique spin on `` now sue '' and never get tired of hearing `` i need you '' which has interesting harmonies and background vocals . as one reviewer stated some songs are simple and uncluttered , it 's just the vocals and a guitar done acoustically . this cd is always in rotation in my player and highly recommended
