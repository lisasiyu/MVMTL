excellent being from portland , the wipers were a band i always knew about but somehow never actually saw . their heyday in portland ended right before i turned 21 , to my eternal chagrin . greg sage is one of the great unkown rock stars of all time , bow down before him . kurt cobain wanted to be greg sage . think i 'm full of it ? listen to the nirvana cover of d-7 on the box set , listen to the original version of d-7 here and then consider the rest of kurt 's music in that light
