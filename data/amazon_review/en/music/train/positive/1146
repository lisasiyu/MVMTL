do not die without first hearing this album holy toledo ! what a mix of unbelievable sounds . from the most haunting melodies to the rockinest guitars ever heard with sounds inbetween you 've never imagined . it 's unnerving and riveting and shocking and there 's a crazy edge to it that kind of stuns the senses because they ca n't be sure they 're really hearing what they 've just heard . highly addictive . highly unusual but an absolute must have listening experience . `` baby 's on fire '' and `` cindy tells me '' are worth the price by themselves . i ca n't live without cranking this thing up two or three times a month and listening to it 2-3 times straight . i 'm going to shut up now because i have to go listen to it again . all the cudos from other reviewers here are dead on . this is one amazing album that i will be drawn to 30 years from now and i 've had the vinyl since '74 . the cd is perfection . this is an underground classic
