amazing melodic death metal this is in my opinion the best performace from anders . he mixes his higher pitched vocals found prominatly on the newer albums with the classic melo death vocals found on earlier albums . there is also some low talking thrown in a few songs , bullet ride being one of them . musically , while its not their best , it is very good . similar to the vocals they mix old and new sound on this cd to create a masterpiece . pounding and yet melodic guitar work is the in flames trademark . also , daniel 's drumming on this album is probably his finest hour , a standout for him being brush the dust away . stand out tracks overall are : bullet ride pinball map square nothing brush the dust away all the songs on here are awesome those are just my favorites . this is a good cd for newcomers because it isnt too much like the old or new and its a great mix . all in all , this is not only one of my favorite cds from in flames , but all time as well
