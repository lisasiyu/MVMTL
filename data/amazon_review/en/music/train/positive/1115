one of the best jazz/country fusion ever done - not air head pop forget about the pop music of loggins and messina . this album is different . this happens to be the best jazz/country fusion album ever done . there 's great musicianship here . there 's excellent instrumental solos that can take up half of the track as in `` move on '' . this is superb music that never made it to the radio . these tracks are simply too long to have gotten air play back in the 1970s . l & m put together a truly great album with mother lode but not too many people have heard it . sadly , they broke up shortly after this album was released . afterwards , kenny made a come-back by going strictly pop .
