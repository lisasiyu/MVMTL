wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! terminal heaven 's rock is a great song ! sick vibration and over amp are pretty good too . over amp has usual weird english lyrics . `` she lives by fake slide away '' . i highly recomend you get this . it 's 12 minutes , 8 seconds a pure good songs . you will listen to them at least three times each time you pop it into your cd player
