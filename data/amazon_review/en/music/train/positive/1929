sophisticated orchestration , great voice , love the words this was the most sophisticated popular music that i heard when i was young . joshua rifkin , who also plays piano rags by scott joplin on another record , arranged and conducted this music . `` both sides now '' ( win and lose are a strange trip in this song ) was a hit on the radio for years , competing with `` walk away renee '' and `` pretty ballerina '' by the left banke for best songs with harpsichord in popular music . i soon bought the judy collins songbook with 55 songs that included eight of the songs on `` wildflower . '' the first musical thing i notice about these songs now is how often i hear a trill or slower alternation between two notes . the first song , `` michael from mountains '' by joni mitchell is in the key of e-flat , with a short introduction that repeats f g f g f g in the treble clef before judy collins starts singing those notes . the second song , `` since you 've asked '' by judy collins , which seems to be in e-minor , starts with an e and d alternating an octave higher over an e-minor7th chord , dropping through b-minor to a c chord with e d e d e d e in the octave of the voice being much like the introduction to `` michael ... '' but with enough g , a sus.4 , d9 , a-minor7th , and b chords to have as much complexity as sophisticated people expect to hear in their music . the words on such simple lines , `` take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood , all the willow winding paths leading up and outward , this is what i give . . . `` are as poetic as can be expected when people hardly listen . `` sisters of mercy '' by leonard cohen is brilliantly done with flutes and french horns . there is certainly more going on than i can describe . judy collins had done `` suzanne '' on an earlier album , `` in my life , '' and the combination of judy singing leonard cohen songs worked so miraculously that `` wildflowers '' took it in a very religious direction . `` priests '' has 7 verses , with the third verse : and who will shoot the arrow that men will follow through your grace . and when i 'm lord of memories and all your armor has turned to lace . the music seems a lot more complicated than a trill , possibly in b-flat-minor , with the notes between the staffs alternating between b-flat and a-flat three times per measure until the chord changes to c-flat . if you have never heard `` la chanson des vieux amants '' by jacques brel and gerard jouannest , you might not realize how sophisticated french popular songs had been before this album pushed american radio up to international standards . big bands had been popular once in the united states , and american music during world war ii might have been as popular as anything the rest of the world had to offer , but i lost track of what songs great singers had to choose from after that , when perry como and dean martin could have used a few more hits . there are some distinct instrumental voices which make the brel song on `` wildflowers '' interesting , but brel often worked with gerard jouannest to achieve musical complexity . so i suspect that this version is notable because judy collins ' french is so beautiful . the final song in her songbook , `` my father , '' ( on the `` who knows where the time goes '' album ) is about `` my father always promised us that we would live in france , '' and she sings like she wants that more than anything else in the world . contemplating intense desire is inspiring , but this song for lovers who have grown old expresses it sweetly . `` oh , mon amour , mon doux , mon tendre , mon verveilleux amour , ... '' `` hey , that 's no way to say goodbye '' is a beautiful song by leonard cohen , soft with sorrow but hey . .
