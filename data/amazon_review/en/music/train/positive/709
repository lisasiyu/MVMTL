great cd , beats a little worse than usual this is a great cd . it is not quite as good as quality , but it is a mix cd so you ca n't expect it to be . the raps and rhymes are great . i think ms. hill is one of kweli 's finest songs . the only problem is the beats are a little sub par for kweli , but still a very good album anyways
