definitely definitive but where 's `` josie '' ? while steely dan has received the compilation treatment on more than one occassion , the latest `` definitive collection '' brings some of the band 's best known work onto a single disc . also , for completeness , one track each from their 'reunion ' cds are included here . steely classics such as `` do it again '' , `` reelin ' in the years '' , `` rikki do n't lose that number '' , `` black friday '' , `` deacon blues '' , `` peg '' and `` hey nineteen '' are all included here and sound just as fresh and unique as they did back in the day . while this collection is an ideal place to start for the beginning dan fan because of its songs and low price , it should be noted that there is one glaring omission to this definitive collection - the all-time classic `` josie '' . granted , this cd is already packed to its limits with close to 78-minutes of music and is excellent from start to finish . however , including `` josie '' and dropping a track like , say `` dirty work '' ( writer 's opinion ) would have made this collection a lot stronger and cohesive overall . i guess this is how the band wanted it because they were indeed involved with the compilation of this collection . apart from this , steely dan 's `` definitive collection '' is a great introduction to the band . for a more comprehensive overview , check out the double-disc compilation `` show biz kids '' which includes all of the tracks included here ( minus the two 'reunion ' tracks ) plus many many more .
