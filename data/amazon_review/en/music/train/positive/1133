wake me up before you go-go ! ! make it big is one of the two wham ! albums with the other being music from the edge of heaven . of all the three albums released by wham ! , make it big is the better one of the three . with three number one hits including `` careless whisper '' , wake me up before you go-go '' and `` everything she wants '' . another song that made the top 5 is `` freedom '' ranking at # 3 . all of the songs on the album r my favorites so i do n't have a clear cut favorite . everyone else haz said wut i wanted to say so there 's no use in repeating it except thta i highly emphasize that if u r an 80s music lover or love to listen to pop in particular , then u must get this album
