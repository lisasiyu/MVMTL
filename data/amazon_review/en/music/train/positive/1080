sonny 's back ! ! i have n't finished listening to this cd , it 's playing as i type now . much that i 've heard lacking in a lot of recordings from the late 70s when mr rollins seemed to be exploring a more popular sound for younger audiences has been recaptured and reshaped , that tone and timbre , his big , full sound , the wonderful improvisation , the sly americana references , the calypso blends , it 's all here . and my best regards to the group , bob cranshaw on bass , steve jordan on drums , bobby broom-guitar , kimati dinizulu-percussionist , and to clifton anderson on trombone , who really knows what it 's all about
