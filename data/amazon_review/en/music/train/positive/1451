catch it if you can it is not always wise to revisit old loves , because nostalgia can be treacherous . but not this time . as an adolescent in the 60s , i , like many of my peers , fell in love with dusty springfield . forty years later , i listened to this collection , and i am in love with her all over again , only more so . her voice was very special . from the country-style folk of the springfields , through the romantic standards , to soulful r & b , she could do it all , and all exquisitely . there are nuances to her singing and a depth of emotion to her voice that i missed first time round . listen to the unique phrasing on the son of a preacher man , a song that she made her own , and the delicious seductiveness of breakfast in bed ( which i heard for the first time on this cd ) and you will see what i mean . her life had tragedy in it . in many ways , the sixties were not as permissive as you might think and the british tabloid press were vicious when they caught the rumor that dusty was a lesbian . this helped destroy her uk career and after that she spent most of her time in the us and the netherlands . by nature insecure , she could not come to terms with her relative loss of celebrity and resorted to drug and alcohol abuse and even a suicide attempt . just when she was making a comeback following her collaboration with the pet shop boys and an appearance on the jools holland tv show ( what a hero that man is ; when are we going to have his show highlights on dvd ? ) she was diagnosed with breast cancer , which ultimately killed her . among the divas of twentieth century british popular music , she is supreme , and was one of the very few to achieve real success in the us also . it was good to hear the look of love on the catch me if you can soundtrack . it will help keep her voice alive for a new generation . that track is on this cd and is just one gem among many . they repay close listening .
