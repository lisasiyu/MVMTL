a classic album ! from the laid-back observations of passenger to the anguished soul squeals of turn blue , iggy injects a range of styles with honesty and irony . from beginning to end , a perfect listening experience ! i do n't think even one song is sub-par ! if you like rock , you must own lust for life !
