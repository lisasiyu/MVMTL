this thang is a superb groove ... . but i never understood why they did n't catch on . they had a bona fide producer in kay gee ( naughty by nature ) , incredible vocal chemistry , heavy-duty promotion , and catchy singles . this resulted in an impressive debut . so why the snub ? i guess that will always be a mystery . anywho , along with blackstreet and age ai n't nuthin ' but a number , pronounced jah-nay ranks as one of the top five best hip-hop/soul debuts of 1994 . and here 's why . it was a very cohesive record , consisting of five r & b entries , with `` hey mr . d.j . `` , `` groove thang '' , and `` sending my love '' making the top five . you think that 's the story ? not ! . the story is how good the rest of the album is . in fact , i will say ( like other very strong debuts ) that the album tracks are better than the singles . and that 's saying a lot , given there are only a handful of hip-hop/swing albums worthy of such praise in the 1990 's . those tracks are : `` sweet taste of love '' , `` changes '' , `` la la la '' , `` for a reason '' and `` hey mr. d.j . remix '' . that 's eight cuts that should get played everytime it 's in the cd player . it does n't get much better than that . in sum , zhane turned out an impressive debut amongst an incredible year of hip-hop soul records . however , their fame did n't last long . they would go on to suffer the dreaded sophomore slump three years later and never release another set . but their debut will never be forgotten . it 's hip-hop/soul at its peak when it was still relatively fresh . and that 's what makes it irresistibly catchy . a hip-hop fan definitely needs to obtain this one , but a casual listener should as well . grade : a
