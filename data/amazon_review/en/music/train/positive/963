eagles learn to rock . great stuff ! ! ! this has 4 stone cold rock classics on it - hotel california , new kid in town , life in the fast lane and victim of love . for these songs alone the album deserves 4 stars . the rest i can pretty much do without . i 'm not a big fan of the slower songs sung by don henley , such as wasted time and the last resort - he sounds much better singing the grittier rock songs . the guitar work throughout is amazing - i still get chills listening to the guitar solo on h.c. even after all this time . felder and walsh sound great together . i hear they 're recording a new album for release late this year and it 's a shame that felder is no longer in the band . anyone who plays guitar like he does is going to be missed , if not by the band then definitely by us listeners
