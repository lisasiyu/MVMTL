if you love rock n ' roll music - buy this ! there 's no point in repeating what others here have said . had it not been for a chance perusal of the review in rolling stone , i never would have known about this cd . it is a great , joyful rock album - i never even listened to the dolls in years gone by - but this one nails the spirit of the genre . i 've worked backstage at stones , ac/dc and dead shows , and i modestly suggest that i know the real thing when i hear it . tear the shrink wrap off , baby , and crank this one up on the way home with the windows down , while the weather is still warm enough to do so ! if you 're a guitarist , pay attention to what syl is playing , and watch the video - he 's really learned to do it right
