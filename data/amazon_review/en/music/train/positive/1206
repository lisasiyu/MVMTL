great but where`s the rest of the best ok so everyone has different tastes but to my mind some of glenn`s best work did not make the cut on this album . instead we`ve been given work which has`nt appeared in any of glenn`s previous releases , common ground , who`s been sleepin in my bed etc , which while good pale beside i volunteer , that girl , some kind of blue which all sound like they could have been eagles tunes . having said that it is a good album although i would recommend soul searchin , strange weather ahead of this one . further proof that the eagles whole is better than its part
