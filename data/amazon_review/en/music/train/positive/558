my favorite & quot ; nearly unknown & quot ; show a great show makes a great cd . i will never understand why this show did n't become a hit ! i saw this show at a local amateur theater and have loved it ever since . maltby and shire are the best composer and lyricists to never have a successful b'way show . this score is great- fatherhood blues , i want it all , the story goes on , the ladies singing their song- these are unforgetable and deserved to be heard . get this gem
