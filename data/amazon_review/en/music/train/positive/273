superb live cd that will draw you in . well , i have to confess that i had never heard of chris until i was taken to a concert back in 2004 . of all the bands that played that night , i have to admit chris really reached me . this cd has a good balance between worshipful songs and ones that rock . chris ' lead guitarist often sounds somewhat similar to u2 's 'the edge ' especially on 'forever ' which really adds a great dimension to the song . i had never fully appreciated worship songs until i heard chris do 'how great is our god ' which gave me a whole new perspective and is very effectively captured on this cd . besides those tunes , the cd becomes a must-buy with the inclusion of a superb energetic version of 'indescribable ' and other popular songs such as 'famous one ' & 'raise up holy hands . ' i had been hoping since that concert that he would release a cd from that tour , and my hope has now been answered ( imagine that ) . 2/06 update : eight of us just saw chris again in saginaw , mi and days later we all agreed that it was one of the best worship experiences of our lives . it 's certainly difficult for a cd to fully match the experience of being there , but with the right perspective , it can get you pretty close . be sure to try and see chris on his current tour w/matt redman & speaker louie giglio
