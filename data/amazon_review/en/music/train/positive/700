lay back jon b. returns with his sophomore efforts with a more relaxing feel with cool relax . 11 of the fifteen were either written or co-wrote by jon and seven of the fifteen were produced by jon b. himself . with hands on experience , this release becomes more personal and touching for its listeners . for the most part , `` bad girl '' has the fastest tempo and blended well with the direction of the lp . hearing jon reach for the higher notes on `` ca n't help it '' was a good display of talent and range as it is altered throughout the song for an appealing tone was quite impressive . the title track was more or less a jazz tune with an upbeat drum track . 2pac was featured with equal time on `` are you still down '' as he almost stole the show until near the end where jon b. flexed his abilities . `` i do ( whatcha say boo ) '' is a song about being in a relationship for some time until he finally pops the question of being married . he then admits how his woman makes him want to stay home instead of hanging with the boys on `` i ai n't going out '' . the inviting `` can we get down '' is seductive as the question itself as he questions his desires to be with someone sexually . hearing jon croon in another language on `` tu amor '' sends this album to heights of a climax indeed in tuned with the title . there 's nothing missing here except maybe the company of someone to enjoy this with
