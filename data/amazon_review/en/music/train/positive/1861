it grows on you . i bought this album two years ago , because i 'd fallen in love with the one song that made it to radio & quot ; in my hands , & quot ; and was hoping the whole album was built like that song . how wrong i was . at the time i hated it . i put it away and did n't listen to it again until about a month ago . while i still think that & quot ; space ceildh & quot ; could stand to go away , i must admit the album grows on you . & quot ; get me through december & quot ; is a haunting song , as is & quot ; flora macdonald. & quot ; i like it more and more
