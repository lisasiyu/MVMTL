does n't get any better than this . i am assuming if you are reading this , i do n't really have to say anything technical about mozart or these great late string quartets . i am only writing this review to let you know ... for anyone who is disappointed with the performance and sound quality of the berg quartet 's emi mozart collection of these same quartets , this is a horse of a different color . recorded in the early 90s for teldec before the berg 's signed with emi , these performances are sublime . you would not belive this is the same group that made those horrid emi records . this is the bergs we all know and love and nobody before or since has made mozart 's string quartets sound this good . perfect intonation , tone , blend , dynamics and yes , passion . i 've had many collections of these works and this leads the field . by far . this one has it all ... . and the teldec sound stage is the cleanest and crystal clear you 'll ever hear . with wonderful front to back depth and air around every note . demonstration sound with great imaging and transparency . you can `` literally '' step inside this recording . well you know what i mean . it really does n't get any better than this
