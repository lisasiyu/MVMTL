dark trance but very calming this double cd is awsome ! nick warrens mixing ability is so awsome and it earns the global underground name . the cd is pretty dark and the songs are not popular club hits , but if you buy this , you shouldnt be expecting it . this cd really puts me into a trance and i love listening to it , expecially when im driving . i would totally buy this cd to mix up your collection
