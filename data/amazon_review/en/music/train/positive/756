worth the money as a boy , i hated all country music , because my father hated rock'n roll . but i knew that hank williams was something special . i bought his 40 greatest several years ago , thinking that this was the ultimate collection . however , for some reason , when this 10 cd collection came out , i bought it . if anyone thinks hank williams was one of the greatest preformers ever based on his hits , you need to hear these cd 's . his versions of songs such as & quot ; cool water & quot ; & quot ; the old home & quot ; & quot ; rocking chair money & quot ; and many others make his hits seem tame . these recordings are masterpieces
