better than most german goth i 'm pretty new to these guys , figured i 'd take some time to dig into german goth since goth is pretty well dead here in the us , by which i mean all the pioneers from the 70 's or 80 's are either gone , changed tracks , or sold out to that crappy early 90 's house tekno sound . these guys have a little of that crappy house sound that you would expect from about 99 % of the so called german goth bands now a days ( and sadly now skinny puppy as well ) , but it also offers a lot of new an original beats which i can really sink my teeth into , also some of it does kind of tug at the ol ' psych a bit , which is a good thing , but it is no where near as amazing as skinny puppy was in its glory days ... ... everything pre-process , though the process was still `` pretty good '' for the most part
