finaly a cd worth the $ $ i wo n't leave a long review but i felt i had to write something in support of this album . as you all know , the millineum brought some pretty bad music with it . the 1990 's brought the best music in my life time when alternative hit the scene . i was born in 65 . i do n't understand how the junk most stations play even gets on the airwaves . in a world that 's pumping out cr @ p music . it 's good to see an artist giving me hope that the industry is n't totaly going down the toilet . a quick rundown : -best song is # 8 -excellent songs are 1,4,6,9,10,11,12,13 -song # 2 and # 5 are still ok -songs 3,5,7 are just average . overall the album has excellent flow , ie . the hit songs are n't the first on the album . -rivals nin 's downward spiral . without a doubt the best or second best nin album . i hope nin will continue . we need to purchase albums like this to show trent r. that we appreciate his work . ps . keep a look out for the new tool cd out in a few days . i 've heard it ( do n't ask ) and it is their best ever ! a must buy . -r
