beautiful debut this is an excellent debut from mindy . her voice is beautiful and each song on here is good . & quot ; guys do it all the time & quot ; is a fun slap in the face for all those & quot ; macho & quot ; types out there , the title song is my favourite though , but all are good , from the love songs to the fun songs . i hope she stays true to her roots though , and does n't go the way of leann rimes and faith hill . one thing i have never understood though , is why nearly all country cds are limited to 10 tracks . this one for example is only 35 minutes long . rock and pop cds quite often exceed 12 songs but country albums rarely even exceed 10 . anyway , thats just an observation , and does n't take away from the worth of this album . recommended
