goregous operetta if you 're a fan of regular book musicals , this one is not for you ! ! ! passion is an operetta style love triangle that is complex , poignant , and beautiful . stephen sondheim 's brillaint score ties the entrie musical together , which again helps him keep his genius status . the clever weaving of songs , scenes , and , most interestingly , letters , make for a great cast album . as for performances , it 's the females who own this show . marin mazzie is as glorious as ever as clara ( she 's even better in ragtime ) , and tony-winner donna murphy brings all of the emotion forward in her portrayal of fosca . for those who are used to the usual sondheim , this one may dissapoint . others , however , will love this opera of love
