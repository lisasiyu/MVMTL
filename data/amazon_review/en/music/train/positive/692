whats to say ? splendid i think this is one of the best films i 've seen in this life . i always wondered what they did to represent a date in the past as well as they did while i watched the movie . the music was a major groundbreaker in helping creating a totally nerve wrecking feeling of belonging to the past . this is music for the mind . it seems to speak a language of its own . i didnt know that i liked scores and instruments before i heard the music of `` road to perdition '' its so complete in its mesmerising process that it makes me want to salute it . certainly the best music i 've heard for any film . i liked the music to `` the village '' too . passion of the christ is another favourite
