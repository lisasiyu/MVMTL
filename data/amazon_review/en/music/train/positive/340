armchair anthropology i have seen the movie and bought the sound track . having marinated my bones and psyche with tibetans for over 25 years this soundtrack unites two ostensiby disparate cultures , america and mongolia . as music is the one art form that transcends cultures , it is intersteing to hear the blues united with their asian cousins . the phenomenon of throat singing is what you have heard in tibetan monks chanting with the ability to produce two tones simultaneously . paul pena , a black , blind , blues singer from california , copped their gig and taught himself how to do this . he went to tuva and won their annual throat singing contest in his category . it is an exposure of the roots . like mongolians do n't get the blues . for any armchair anthropoligist , this cd is a must . the movie will make you cry as you see the challenges that paul faces , distantly empowered by the deceased physicist , richard feinman , who went to tuva on his last journey . paul 's trip is peppered with stickers that they paste up , & quot ; feinman lives & quot ; feinman was a great thinker from far rockaway , n.y. who collected stamps from tuva as a child . this record is strange and profound . irresistable for any thinking person
