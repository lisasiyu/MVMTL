they still got it i 'm no longer as ignorant about public policy and processes and the government as i was when i started listening to the likes of `` suffer '' and `` against the grain '' . now i do n't protest things or show support by voicing my opinions for all to hear or through public action like a pretentious prick , but now i do it by voting and posting crappy reviews . and i do n't totally agree with bad religion like i used to , but , i got ta hand it to them , they definitely churned out another great album and i love the songs . `` beyond electric dreams '' , `` los angeles is burning '' , `` sinister rouge '' , `` god 's love '' are all great . i say , you do n't have to support the band view on the current issues and whatnot , but show the love for the band and their musical talent
