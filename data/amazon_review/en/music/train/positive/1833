by far the best group these days good music is easy to come-by ... great music is rare . what an incredible combination of talent ritchie and candy have ! i 've known of ritchie of years , from his 'rock ' days and always respected his talent . but blackmore 's night is probably one of the most wonderful convergences of talents i 've encountered . i wish i could say i listened to blackmore 's night on purpose , but it was quite by accident . nonetheless , i was enchanted enough to look into what they had done . i 'll never regret it . they are unsurpassed in the music world these days . candy 's voice and lyrics and ritchie 's guitar ... it does n't get any better
