best disney film score while i 'm not always a big fan of the musical-esque style of disney movies ( although the kids love it , and that 's what matters ) , sleeping beauty is one of the best orchestrated films i can remember . george bruns does a brilliant job of arranging tchaikovsky 's score from the sleeping beauty ballet . the recording itself is decently remastered , and the small ensemble performing is excellent . mary costa 's vocals are flawless and almost supernatural . if ever there were a disney soundtrack to own , this would be it
