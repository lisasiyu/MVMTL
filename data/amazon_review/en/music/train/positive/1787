everytime i hear this i can not believe it 's not huge ! ! ! ! i am a 34 year old real estate agent who used to own a dance club ... . think 10 years ago going to school ... my personal leanings musically are more 80 's dance and new wave ... i got into the gin blossoms , toad the wet sprocket , origin stuff in the early 90 's but when nirvana changed the style of mainstream music i sort of dropped out ... went to dance music and there wasnt much of it ... these past few years as i was busy with a family and real job i have not payed much attention but about a year ago i found synthpop and www.adifferentdrum.com and www.slothradio.com aside from the synthopop and blank and jones type stuff i have been listening to i also have liked a lot of the teen-i-bopper music out latley ... really top fourtyish as it has a dancable beat and the best writers seem to have gone that direction for the money ... . k thats a long intro for why this album blows me away ... i have all this stuff playing in my office to keep me and my staff pumped all the time and whats wierd is we have this server ( itunes ) where everyone can choose from 90 gigs woths of music and with itunes you can keep track of number of plays . in the past 3 months with probably 100 new cds in the server in that time this one is on top of all of them with the killers coming in second . its sort of dark , but energy filled , incredible vocals and it really makes you want to dance . please ... check out the different mixes of
