mastered the art listening to 'mastered the art ' is the acoustic equivalent of running your hand over shag carpet that has n't been vacuumed since the seventies - it reveals a surprising accumulation of hidden textures and diverse beats , from spanish-style acoustic guitars and menacing orchestration to xylophones and galaga samples ( you know the tractor beam sound just before your ship gets taken up ) . 'mastered the art ' is a gigantic mixed-media canvas that subsumes all the brilliance of his previous albums while adding authentic variation and depth . like any original work of art , 'mastered the art ' is difficult to categorize - it represents the leading edge in the ongoing revolution that is combining hip-hop , jazz , groove , and funk into unique and powerful musical expressions . greyboy is an accomplished composer and this album is a masterpiece . now if only he 'd publish the complete list of his 8-track collection . .
