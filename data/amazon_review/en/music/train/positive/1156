here 's what you do wow / grape jam is incomplete . so is columbia legacy 's vintage . answer ... .buy both albums ( amazon 's other buying options still has some copies of vintage for around $ 15/disc - which in california is a third of a fill up for a camery ) .take the best cuts of both , and put them on a blank disc ( the only song you wont have is the ( very spacy ) the lake , and the announcement to turn your platter speed from 33 1/3 to 78 for just like gene autry , a foxtrot that was on the original wow album . this album reminds me a lot of buffalo springfield again . pungiant little gems from a rapidly disintegrating band . enjoy . incidentally , you can do this , add the place and the time ( original version - from vintage ) , miller 's blues ( live - from vintage ) , and still have around 7 minutes to mess around with . great for a car backup
