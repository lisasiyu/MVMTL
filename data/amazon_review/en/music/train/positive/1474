almost cried i went on my lunch break to the local radio store as i usually do to purchase music . i had been meaning to replace my other shirley murdock cd 's that ungrateful people refused to return , but when i saw the greatest hits cd , i snatched it quick , fast , and in a hurry ! ! ! ! it had everything ! ! ! ! ! when i heard `` go on without you , i was at work , and the only thing stopping me from letting my co-workers sample my voice was the fact that i need my money ! ! ! ! ! my eyes filled with tears because music just doesnt get any better than what that sista did to me at that moment ! ! ! i love it and i cant wait for that drive home so i can let all of houston hear it . if you collect old school music -- -this one is a must have ! ! ! ! ! ! ! how bout ' that ! ! ! ! !
