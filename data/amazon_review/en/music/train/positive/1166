smoooooooth , cool , and hip west coast sound when i first heard this album it captured me . now that i 've expanded my house collection my tastes have changed a little , but i still consider this to be a stellar deep house album . there are enough memorable tracks on this 2-disc set to easily justify owning it . my favorites are `` waiting '' , `` next to me '' , `` do n't stand there '' , `` do n't change '' , `` you ca n't stop '' , `` petalpushing '' , `` the remedy '' , and `` lionel 's jam '' ( in that order ) . i own just about everything migs has put out and i consider this to be his best . if i may drop a sales pitch for a couple of his other works it would be jay-j & miguel migs - in the house and miguel migs - colorful you . this latter one has some incredible r & b tracks . my only criticism of miguel migs is that some of his tracks have too much reggae and latin/jazz for my tastes . nevertheless , he is one of the best dj/producers i 've ever heard .
