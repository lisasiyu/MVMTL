plush is real comfort so you wan na have music on that provides some real audio comfort , music that has some very cool rhythms , music that is well-orchestrated and textured , well search no more for plush delivers on all levels , it is a lovely mix of music in the so-called `` downtempo '' vein but it is really above and beyond just the latest kind of thing , instead it is a combination of some very sexy music that exemplifies the best in current trends in music ! i found it to be wonderful for playtime and my lover agreed with some stunning sonic cues to me as the disc unwound the first time we had it on as we got it on ! it is certainly a great disc for the romantically inclined although it is good enough to be just darn good without having to occupy anything specific by way of description since it rolls easily all the way from the very cool to the beautifully hot . i could wax on about my fave tracks but i actually love them all , it is a well put together set and has that magical sort of flow from track to track . you should try it on for love , do n't even say a word to your sweetie , just put forward your best kiss and let the disc play , plush indeed
