timeless the word & quot ; classic & quot ; , in my opinion , has been way over used in describing noted records.but if there ever was one , this is it ! janis ' best and one of rock n'rolls best.the right songs , the right band and janis.timeless.full tilt boogie really took these songs where the ( pretty lousy ) big brother never could have.if janis had lived , the sky would 've been the limit.her heart and soul in every song.a truly great work .
