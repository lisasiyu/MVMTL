glider some of this is quite pretty - - `` kometenmelodie 2 '' , in fact , waxes practically majestic . and it 's true : the title track glides along with four wheels off the ground for 22 minutes or so . and the recorder piece that closes the album ( replete with little birdies twittering all over the place ) is a bit of a pleasant and unexpected surprise ; `` morgenspaziergang '' , after all , translates as `` a morning walk '' . not quite of its time , and slightly before it , you have a bona fide classic here . fah'n on .
