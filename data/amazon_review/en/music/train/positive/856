amazing music from an amazing band ! every track on this album is a standout . an instant classic from a classic band . the boys have never rocked harder , sang better , and grooved groovier . i ca n't get this cd out of player . i ca n't get the hooks out of my mind- i go to sleep at night humming one of the tunes , usually the joseph williams-sung chorus on `` bottom of your soul . '' i absolutely loved the guest musicians on this record- james pankow ( chicago ) and ian anderson ( jethro tull ) especially . i do n't know if you can call steve porcaro a `` guest-musician , '' especially with artistic work with the overall sonic `` canvas '' and cool timbres he is able to evoke . he is a genius . why these guys ca n't get any radio airplay in the states anymore is beyond me . they are so much better than all of the crap that comes out on the radio nowadays . i hope they tour the us hard for the next couple of years and win over old-fans and new converts .
