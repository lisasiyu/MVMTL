the doors and dts audio i became a doors fan way back when they released their first album . forty years later most of their music still bends my ear . this elaborate box set is worth seeking out , especially given the limited numbers available . i read some reviews about the cd remixes that were disappointing . well , folks , they were wrong . and if that 's all you 're looking for they are being released as single cds in the very near future . i wanted this for the dts dvd audio discs that bring this set to twelve discs . nevermind the historic but boring videos tagged on . the dts surround sound is nothing less than stunning . from strange days through la woman , the recordings were obviously meant to be heard this way . the remixes only enhance my favorites . and this begs my next plea : i have this set , i have talking heads dual disc brick , and pet sounds , and the beatles love , and lyle lovett 's joshua judges ruth , richard thompson , etc. , all in 5.1 surround and/or dts . i would really enjoy the beatles catalogue in dts , as well as most of joni mitchell 's catalogue . and michael jackson , dwight yoakam , steely dan , tom waits , and any other artist whose music is marked by originality and impeccable recordings . the success of perception should be a positive indicator that there are tons of music whackos like me willing to shell out hard cash for items like this . all you record companies that are so worried about pirating and downloading ? not us ! give us what we want , ( and these are n't downloadable ) ! win win ! sony dropped the ball bigtime with sacd , do n't let us down like they did !
