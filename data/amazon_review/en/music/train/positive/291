i 'm sick of it all ... ok , so ks has a similar voice to conor oberst . so what ? what 's the big deal ? blink-182 , good charlotte , and simple plan all sound exactly the same , and they 're getting five star reviews ! just lay off of it . and , even though their voices are similar , their music is much different , they sound different . they even use orchestras and accordions and brass and woodwinds and ... well , that 's it . but this is not your ordinary rip off folk/indie band . and , maybe his voice naturally sounds like conor oberst 's . you ca n't help that . an angle are very talented and experiment with different sounds . i pop this cd in from time to time , not my favorite , but it 's very good ! so , just give this a chance without thinking it as a bright eyes rip-off , because that 's just what it 's not
