quality retro whatever happened to melody , creativity , individuality and good old beats ? somewhere along the line it has been replace by singers who ca n't sing , write or play an instrument , songs without melodies and beats as monotonous as a flywheel . fortunately the eurythmics are of the former school - turning out original , quality hits that showed a spark of genius at times . ( `` sweet things '' is perhaps the most famous song of the decade - deservedly so . ) the haunting voice , odd instrumentation and artistic approach to every track makes this one a winner . my grade :
