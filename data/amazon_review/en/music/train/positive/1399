incredible ! ! the guitar intro to riptide is worth the price of this cd alone . lou really shines on egg cream , adventurer , riptide , set the twilight reeling and finish line . the only week song on this collection is hooky wooky . i bought this cd in 2004 and i ca n't stop listening to it ... ..very groovy !
