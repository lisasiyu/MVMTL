incredible texas music album this is without a doubt the best texas music album i 've ever heard , and quite possibly my favorite cd i own . i just do n't get tired of it . there 's simply not a weak song on the album , and there 's a good variety of upbeat songs as well as slower , more somber ones . pick this one up .
