merritt creates an alternate universe , where , the real world does n't matter . when it comes to `` pop , '' people are use to hearing the crap played on the popular radio stations . brittany spears , and terribly horrid music like that . i want people to know the true meaning of `` pop '' music . here it is in the dictionary : `` a bland watered-down version of rock'n'roll with more rhythm and harmony and an emphasis on romantic love '' now , before anyone bashes me , i do n't agree with the `` bland '' and `` watered-down '' words , expecially in the case of stephin merrit , but it 's true of the music played today . there 's magic in this album . it 's so full of life , and dare i say , the bliss of happiness . it 's truly amazing how `` wasps ' nests '' can completely change my perceptions . it puts me in a state of mind . maybe i 'm just a hopeless romantic , but this album happens to be the soundtrack to my life , as cheesy as that sounds . and no matter how cheesy the lyrics may be , you 'll find yourself in love with them , almost as much as the luscious sound that is , `` the 6ths . '' a masterpiece
