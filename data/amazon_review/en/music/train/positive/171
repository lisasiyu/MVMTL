not your father 's paul simon album . this is a very different sounding paul simon album . the influence of brian eno is obvious and at times over-the-top . my conclusion , now that i 've had this album for a while , is that it 's not one that i 'm constantly listening to but , when i 'm in the mood , this is really an interesting and fun album . occasionally , paul reaches heights i do n't feel he 's reached since graceland . there are some great songs on here . if you 're looking for `` still crazy after all these years '' or `` 50 ways to leave your lover '' - type songs , you 're not going to find them here . if you 're interested in hearing paul push the envelope , however , this is the one . paul hits the mark more often than he misses it on this one
