grushecky 's `` a good life '' is a great listen ! ! ! veteran rocker joe grushecky is back with a new cd , entitled a good life . in an age where there 's possible instant fame with tv shows and slick videos , grushecky did it the old fashioned way : grinding it out in clubs and theatres over the years . starting 25 years ago with his band , the iron city houserockers , grushecky 's always been part working class hero & part philosopher . it 's a combination that has held up over time and this new cd is full of tunes that will make you think as well as crank up the stereo . gary borress , ny
