shock and awe i feel like such a fool ! this album is 6 years old and i heard it for the first time a few weeks ago . what 's more , i 've since asked several of my friends who also love neo-soul music if they 've heard it , and may of them did n't even know who i was talking about . that is a crime , because this album is fantastic . fantastic , i say . it 's one of those albums where i did not have to look at the album credits to see who wrote and produced the songs . it 's obvious from how his voice perfectly compliments the music that his is not simply the voice chosen to sing these songs that someone else wrote . this is what i appreciate most about the neo-soul genre ; the tendency for the artists who perform the music to be more than just singers . they are musicians . ( this is what is so frustrating about brian mcknight , incidentally . he is a musician , but still refuses to sing in his vocal range . many of the songs that he has written for himself are too high for him ! that just should n't be ) in any case , go get this album if you like good music
