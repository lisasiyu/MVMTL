i 've just heard the best ! ! ! my wife and i just returned from the john jorgenson concert in jonesborough , tn . we agreed that neither of us expects to ever hear a finer guitarist ! we bought two of his cds during intermission ( including franco-american swing ) . as much as we will enjoy listening to them for years to come , nothing will replace the rare privilege of `` seeing '' this master play . the experience ca n't be described with words . the audience even gave him a standing ovation at the intermission of his two set show ! and two more before the end of the evening 's concert . buy this cd ... you are n't likely to regret it . and check out his web site www.johnjorgenson.com to see if he is playing anywhere near you . it will be worth the drive to catch his show .
