if only all albums were like this one there 's a difference between an o.k . album and a good one , all mod cons is neither , all mods con is a masterpeice . it has a level of quality that few albums have , great songs , great production , and great fade ins and fade outs , no this is not just a collection of songs all laced together in any random order . a very well thought out sequence has the album 's lone cover the 60's-ish psychedelic/mod/pop sound that is david watts ( a kinks song ) followed , by & quot ; english rose & quot ; 's acoustic guitar and ocean waves , and when the singing kicks in , and thats when it hits you how good this album really is . & quot ; in the crowd & quot ; 's bass lines , guitar riffs , and melodies , is one of the many gentle gems in the album . and then just when you think you 're listening to a 60 's pop album , & quot ; billy hunt & quot ; 's guitar intro punches in , reminding you , the jam were many things , including a great punk band . well i guess i should end there , thats tracks 4-7. but i should mention my favorite tracks right now are ( 2 ) & quot ; to be someone ( did n't we have a nice time ) & quot ; and ( 8 ) & quot ; it 's too bad & quot ; but honestly the whole album is a pleasure to hear from the & quot ; 1,2,3,4 & quot ; whisper/intro to the haunting closer & quot ; down in the the tube station at midnight. & quot ; albums just do n't get better than this one , folks
