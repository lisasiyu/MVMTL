my top release of 2006 i can not state more emphatically that sunset rubdowns album is my pick for album of the year , not just for how surprisingly good it is to anyone that enjoyed wolf parade 's incredible debut but because it is simply inspiring from start to finish . as a whole this is the most delightful kind of album , the one you wish everyone 's side-band would put out to keep the enthusiasm going . the fact that it will remain under almost everyone 's radar is not entirely bad , as it leaves it open for discovery many , many years down the road
