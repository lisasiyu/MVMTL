really the thing that gets me really the thing that gets me is not dolphy 's playing at all . it 's bobby hutcherson 's . he is a master on this album , proving solo after solo that his taste is something to be reckoned with . if you are a fan of the vibraphones , and want to hear them used the exact opposite of the way that the modern jazz quartet used them , grab your keys , walk out of your door , lock your door , walk down the path in front of your house , out of your front yard , shutting the small latch on your gate , get in your car and go to a music store . once there , head to the jazz section and get this album . or , you know , click buy . either way . it 'll work
