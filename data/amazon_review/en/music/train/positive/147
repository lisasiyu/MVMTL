food and liquor is an classic hands down ! ! ! ! ! i must say that when i first heard `` kick push '' i thought to myself that this guy really had something to talk about because he is such a metaphoric rhymer and his delivery is very strong so i know i had to buy lupe fiasco 's debut album `` food and liquor '' . after listening to this album from beginning to end i was not at all disappointed but indeed this album really let me know that there are still a few rappers out there that are still kicking rhymes about issues that we deal with in everyday life instead of hearing these other mc 's that dont rap about anything except cars , clothes , jewelry , and women . i would recommend this album to anyone that is a fan of real rap because this album will open your eyes to alot of things in life . my 5 favorite tracks are : 1 . `` the cool '' - this song is basically about a young man who had died ( not literally ) but he was able to come back to life and try to make a change for the better but at the same time he chose to live his life the same way he had lived it once before . song is very metaphor and deep . 2 . `` he say she say '' - this song is about a little boy who doesnt have a visible father and it is affecting him deeply . 3 . `` hurt me soul '' - this song talks just about any issue you can think of from women being degraded in rap music , drug dealing , crooked cops , government not offering black people welfare and overcharging healthcare , johns and prostitutes . song also has a very nice hook . 4 . `` sunshine '' - this song is about this girl that he falls in love with in a club eventhough he 's not looking for love he can not resist it with this girl . 5 . `` pressure '' featuring jay-z- very nice concept to it from lupe 's standpoint and eventhough im not a big jay-z fan he still put down a nice verse . other songs i like are `` just might be ok '' , `` daydreaminin '' , `` kick push '' , `` i gotcha '' , '' instrumental '' , and `` american terrorists '' . i would recommend this album to anyone who is a true fan of real rap because it will not disappoint you at all ! ! ! !
