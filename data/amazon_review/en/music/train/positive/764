not the beatles thats for sure if you are looking to add to your beatles collection be forewarned . this is not your typical beatles fare . it is however a good deal better than fair after you get past trying to peg it as a beatles album . its lennon . he 's pissed off . he has a lot to say and he says it all on this record . he sings these songs like he has wanted to sing them forever but was never allowed . he breaks these songs out like they are part of a therapy session and he doesnt turn back . this album on 1st listen is a bit of a disappointment to me . on 2nd listen you know what its all about and you dont listen for pop hits , you listen for the album as you heard it the first time . the only way most people will enjoy this album is after a few listens especially if your going into it with a preconceived notion . also a lot of songs on this album have a rocky start and then pick up steam in the middle . this album is ultimately very good once you know what your getting into . its lennon breaking the chains from the beatles and really from himself . after the 3rd listen , it immediately made sense to me . now i cant put it down
