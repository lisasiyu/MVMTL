live in paris : evanescence i first need to say , if it were n't for the dvd and all of its features , anywhere but home would have gotten three stars . i say this because , evanescence does not sound as good live as they do in the studio . the cd : this contains the audio to the rock band 's performance live in paris . it also has the album 's most beautiful and stand out track : `` missing '' . the concert : the overall sound balance for this rock band is way off for this performance and the distorted guitars tend to drown out anything in the form of a musical line . amy lee also has her share of troubles for this performance . she can sing her high loud notes pretty well , but her lower ones tend to be in a constant use of pedal tones . late into the performance , amy 's voice cracks and even starts to give out on her . she does however , know how to work the crowd . the bands newer tracks are well performed , and the covers they perform sound better than their own work . this is good and bad ; it shows that evanescence can play pretty well , but they need a lot more practice playing live and communicating with each other live . the best part to this concert is getting to see the beautiful amy lee perform and add new and very interesting introductions to some of the band 's songs . awesome performances include : `` thoughtless '' `` breathe no more '' `` farther away '' `` bring me to life '' `` whisper '' dvd features : this disc is awesome because it has so many features . it of course has evanescence 's performance in paris . it also has music videos for `` going under '' , `` bring me to life '' , `` everybody 's fool '' , and `` my immortal '' . there is also a hidden video icon of evanescence 's band symbol . when this is activated , another live performance of `` bring me to life '' is played . the disc also has tons of rehearsal , bloopers , and on the road footage ; including evanescence 's tour with seether . the credits also have the audio to evanescence 's newest track `` missing '' . anywhere but home is an interesting concert and a fun look into evanescence 's life , i recomend viewing it
