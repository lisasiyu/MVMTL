yep , it 's amazing ... what more can be said ? this album blows so many great albums in rock history away . i became a fan of dishwalla when i was 15 . i bought their first cd like a week before counting blue cars started getting airplay everywhere . but ever since i got this amazing cd i have just not enjoyed pet your friends nearly as much as i used to . that 's not trashing pet your friends . this album 's just that amazing .
