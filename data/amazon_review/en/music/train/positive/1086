every track takes you 'across the pond' you will not be disappointed by this delightful album ! this may be sacrilege , but the chieftains can get old after a while ( well , they are old ) ... and altan is certainly a breath of fresh air . these folks know what they 're doing , and you can hear it in their whimsical reels . i look forward to getting more of their stuff . highly recommended
