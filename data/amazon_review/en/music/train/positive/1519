him review i was rather dissapointed by the awful review 's of this cd . i love the band and consider all of there cd 's to be the best one 's in my collection . ville valo 's lyrics just pull you into a different reality . the bands songs mixed with the chris isaak and blue oyster cult 's covers of wicked game and do n't fear ( the reaper ) make the cd better than imaginable . i do n't care what the other reviews say i would consider this one of my favorite cd 's .
