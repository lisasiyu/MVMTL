more great juno reactor ! there are a few tracks that stand out on this album . pistolero is fantastic with its spicy latin sound , and masters of the universe is good in the typical way . the deep throaty vocal samples in the track entitled badimo are very interesting , and carry a unique vibration . i wonder what it means ... if you like juno reactor , this album is worth a look at least
