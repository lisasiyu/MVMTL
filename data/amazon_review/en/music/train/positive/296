cementing their standing as hip hop megastar icons outkast had been out for a minute but this album made me become a true fan and recognize their creativity . this album is crunk , it 's exciting , it 's brilliantly put together and a fine example of hip hop at its best . outkast is pioneering and yet so fantastic they 're almost mainstream now -- but in a good way ( outkast is the anti-black eyed peas , lol ) . stankonia just continues outkast 's everchanging shape that keeps taking hip hop to higher levels . if you 've listened to southernplayalisticadilacmuzik , atliens and aquemini , you probably know to expect the unexpected on this album . stankonia is one of the hip hop albums i always throw up in debates as proof that good hip hop can still simultaneously make you dance/groove and think at the same time . that andre 3000 is deceptively very , very political , but you got ta pay attention or you 'll miss his messages . highly recommended lp . fun and crunk with hidden social/political commentary . one of my all-time favorite albums
