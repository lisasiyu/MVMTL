music from your bone marrow the other reviewers are spot-on exact about the loveliness of this music . i shall only add that i gave my copy away about 6 months ago but am only now replacing it -- the tunes are finally sounding a little worn and faded when i play them in my memory . this music accompanies you after a while . it is a quiet conversation with a much beloved friend , a silk scarf against the wind , a warm bowl of good soup on a damp chilly day . enjoy
