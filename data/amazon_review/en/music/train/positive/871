great cd ! this greatest hits collection is a nice overview of jermaine 's work from the late '70s , through to the early '90s . there are some great upbeat dance tracks along with some slow jams . the only downside to this collection is that it does n't include & quot ; when the rain begins to fall & quot ; , a duet that he did with pia zadora back in 1983/84 . this does n't take away from the other classics like & quot ; do what you do & quot ; , and & quot ; dynamite & quot ; . i seemed to have a few singles of jermaine 's from back in the day , so it 's nice to have his songs on cd to enjoy for a long time . there are other greatest hit collections out there , but i opted for this one because it was released by arista , which was one of 3 labels that jermaine was signed with . it sounds clear & amp ; clean , not screechy like some other older recordings converted to cd do . if you like some great r & amp ; b , then jermaine jackson 's & quot ; heritage collection & quot ; will hit the spot
