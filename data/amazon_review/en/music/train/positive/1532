... remains the favorite . it 's a tough call between this red house offering and & quot ; one more goodnight kiss & quot ; , but this record remains my favorite greg brown album and one of my all-time favorites ( mind you , most of greg 's albums appear on that atf list ! ) . each song takes you through the country , no matter wh'er you live there or not . if you 've ever sweated in a growing season or you 've walked a gravel road , this album 's for you..
