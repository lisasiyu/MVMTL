teenage memories my friend marc and i used to take trips to the old coastal bunkers all around the san francisco bay area to map them out . the first thing we would do when hopping into the car was stick the slider in the 8 track . now admittedly , the lyrics were nonsensical and silly , but the sound was so catchy , that in no time we 'd be singing along with them . the sound was just so unique and riveting , that we 'd listen over and over . point is , this album will give bring back memories if you grew up in that era , and will give you an idea of what it was really like growing up in the 70 's
