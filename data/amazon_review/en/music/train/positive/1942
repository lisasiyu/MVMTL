great overview ( but sometimes a difficult listen ) while the idea to make a collection of the fall out of punk and hardcore scenes in the 1980s after the great no thanks box is a really interesting idea yet it proves extremely hard to pull off . why ? well when punk became new wave and hardcore became alternative , you were left with so many sounds , so many viewpoints . while it totally made the music scene much more interesting compiling it to 4 discs makes it a hard listen sometimes because of that collage of styles . so its a great learning experience for the uninitiated to learn from , and its a great nostalgia trip for those who grew up with this music . for those of us in the middle we are left kinda scratching our chins and flipping over some of the tracks . i must say however that rhino did choose the prime cuts from each group , and chose the right groups from each scene but thats what rhino is great at archival material . its by no means a bad box set in fact its really quite the opposite , but i guarantee even the most open minded listeners will find themselves hitting the skip button past their first listen
