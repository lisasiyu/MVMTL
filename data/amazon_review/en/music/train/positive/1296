beautiful piece of audio art as i said just above , this is a prime example of what i like to call audio art . from the dynamio begginning to the story song ending it is a great album through and through . it is more electric then their debut release but it 's a welcomed change . not that the debut was bad . the songs tell tales of broken hearts and the story song carries along a nice message of anti-suicide which is a welcome break from other bands out there . i give it five stars because the music flows together so well , the quality is magnificent and the whole album is so through out and well laid that it deserves nothing less
