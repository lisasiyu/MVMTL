loved this i love this cd . i watched the concert and was blown away . there are very few things to complain about when listening to this cd . i wish they had put the tracks on the cd in the order they appeared in the concert . i also wish they could 've done something with correcting the pitch on the destiny 's child tracks . it was painful to watch them doing it when the concert aired and it 's worse listening to it while trying to drive . this cd is worth what you pay for it . where else could you get billy joel , elton john , james taylor , john mellencamp , paul mccartney and the who on one cd
