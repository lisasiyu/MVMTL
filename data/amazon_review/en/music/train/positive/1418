a very pleasant surprise ... .. i must admit that i have never been a boyzone fan and quite fankly i found ronan 's solo efforts rather dull , so when a friend lent me a copy of boyzone member stephen gately 's debut solo cd i was rather skeptical . i was pleasantly surprised . this cd is filled with wonderful pop sounds and stephen 's sweet singing voice is used to full effect here . with several tracks cowritten by stephen himself , the lyrics are basically dealing with his coming-out . a wonderful cd - i throughly recommend it
