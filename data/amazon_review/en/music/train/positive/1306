the return of the massachusetts metal masters ! the almighty unearth has returned to us with a brand new ep entitled endless . picking up right where 'the stings of conscience ' left off , this massachusetts metal machine is ready to kick your teeth in once more . first of all the new material is more metal if you can believe that . the song endless could very well be the greatest hardcore song erver written . the track kicks off with susi and mcgrath going absolutly ape ... on their axes and trevor spitting some of the most truthful and inspiring lyrics ever written . the track ends with one of the most monstrous breakdowns i have ever experienced . awesome ... . internal war is an anti war song and here we witness some absolute sick skin smashing from mike rudberg . the pace is fast as susi and mcgrath lead the way accompenied by phipps as he belts out words of truth : 'power in the wrong hands , our scaffold is destroyed , children killing children cuz the government has ignorned , i sling my arrow to shatter your walls , no more creating victims from ignorance ' . i loved the charm , because its like an old guitar driven eighties metal tune sounding like something shadows fall may write . once again gutiars fly all over the place and trevor sounding like a psychotic madman . this is followed with some sick breakdowns and some bad ... solos . the last track my desire also appeared on their full length . i for one do not really dig eps , but unearth is one of my favorite bands so i gave em a 5 . if you dig any european influenced metalcore or just plain old hardcore , unearth is the band for you , and i for one can not wait for a new full length
