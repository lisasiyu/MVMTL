a fun and enjoyable trip down memory lane if you like huey lewis , do n't hesitate to pick up this disc . it has a nice mixture of hits from the 80s , 90s , and today . you can tell the upper end of huey 's voice has suffered a little bit with age . but otherwise he and his ( now ) larger band sound great . i especially enjoyed the new arrangement of `` do you believe in love . '' as somebody who grew up during the 80s ( when huey was at his peak ) , this disc has been a real treat to listen to .
