one of the most original and best albums in the last 10 years this album is without any doubt one of the most original cds i have ever heard . the success in which kearney mixes musical styles is astounding . what makes this album so enjoyable besides the catchy melodies , good lyrics and his voice is the top notch production given to each of the tracks . there is so much here that one most listen to the album a good 3 or 4 times before you start to truly appreciate the depth of this work .
