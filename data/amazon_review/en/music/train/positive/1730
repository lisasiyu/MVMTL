2 of the best what a pleasure to sit down and listen to such great artists , they certainly do not come like that today . great sound to , it 's like one is there , job well done by the sound people . i saw louis armstrong in holland in 1959 and it will always be for me the best jazz concert i have ever been to . i recommend this cd to anyone . aalf j molenberg .
