just wow , no words to describe it . where should i start , well it was 1997 when my older cousin said let me show you a game . it was of course ffvii , i was blown away by the game . at the time i was 7 years old . i immediatly bought the game and played it straight through . i always loved the music , it was one of the many fine elements of the game . nobuo uematsu did an amazing job with the music he is truly an amazing person , if i saw him walking down the street i would bow before him and kiss his shoes ( i bet i 'm not the only one who would do that ) . here i am now 15 years old just listened through all 4 ( yes four ! ! ! ) cd 's ( which i put on my ipod . i was blown away , with each song i remember exactly what took place in the game and where i was and what i was doing . any fan of ff would love this but even people who never played the series would appreciate it , but if you have played the game straight through you can get the full effect of it . the price you say may be high but lets do a little math here . all four cd 's cost $ 29.18 now there are 85 songs . divide and each song will cost about 34 cents , yes 34 cents . you buy songs on itunes for 99 cents . it 's a great deal , i would pay $ 100 for this . if you played ffvii buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you hav n't played ffvii buy the game , it 's the best game ever screw halo 2
