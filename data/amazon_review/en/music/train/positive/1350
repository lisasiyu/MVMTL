the offical amazon hip-hop reviewer hello there people looking into buying thug life volume 1. i would first like to start with a little information on thug life which was the name of a rap group which featured 2pac , big syke , mopreme and a few other 's . if you are a 2pac fan you may of already heard of this album although this album is one of 2pacs most unrecornised albums and when 2pac founded the group in 1993 they where quite unknown to the public and it was only after 2pac was shoot when people noticed the album . the thug life group may better today be known as the outlawz with big syke changing his name to mussilini on the outlawz albums 2pac to makaveli , mopreme did not stay with the group when they changed there names to the outlawz which was a shame due to the fact mopreme was one of the better rappers on the thug life album , he was also the son of the late mutulu shakur which was 2pacs stepfather . mutulu is mentioned alot in 2pacs older albums due to the fact mutulu was there for tupac and tupac saw him as a father figure , even though mutulu was placed on the fbi 's most wanted list after escaping from prison in the 80 's tupac looked up to him . the name thug life is a name 2pac called the group with the meaning : the hate u gave little infants f**k every1 which spells out thug life if you use the first letter in every word . the notoious b.i.g was also meant to join the group when they had first started but the record label desided against it and removed b.i.g * the album * this is a old classic album and fans of tupac would be expected to have this place near the top shelf of any cd rack , due to tupacs death the rise of price 's to shakurs albums means they have shoot up quite a lot and you could be expected to pay from $ 15 and upwards per album but at the moment i think this album is going rather cheap . if your a fan of all eyez on me and alot of tupacs latier stuff and style then this album may not be your best album to buy , tupac is often well know for his poetic rhyming and graphic lyrics but this album is more hardcore and talk 's about diffrent topics in one song rather then the song telling a story of just one topic ie : tear drops and close caskets there seems to be more of a darker side to this album and although the album is diffrent to shakurs newer stuff this album is still a brilliant album , ( i did n't leave this album to be the last one to buy till i finished my pac collection , i think it was the 3rd i bought ) there are some brilliant songs on this album , songs like how long will you morn me in memory for kado ( r.i.p ) which also d.m.x . does a memorial for kado at the end of where the hood at vidoe even if you buy the album for how long will they morn me it is still money well spent due to the song been such a classic with great lyrics and a brilliant choaros by nate dogg , there are other great song on there too with great basic background beats of the drums with a funky tune the come over the drums . plent of song reach out and touch you when listening to the lyrics and you will find your self listening to the album more and more once you own it , also the lyrics are easy to pick up on and means easier to sing along with ( we all like a good sing along ) i would recomend this album to first time buyer 's and defo to old 2pac fans who hav n't got it yet . thank you for taking the time to read my review , i hoped it help you in your choice . please feel free to leave coments and to also look at my other reviews by clicking on `` see all reviews '' button next to my name
