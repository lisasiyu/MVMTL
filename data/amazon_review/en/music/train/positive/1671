klute covers the whole spectrum i 've seen ( heard -- whatever ) klute spin a few times , and he is unbelievable . mostly dark , hard stuff ( which is my taste -- see his breakbeat science exercise mix cd ) . this orginally produced music by him brings out some different tastes i did n't realize he had in him . i 'm not going to get into his `` collage of genres '' cd ( # 2 ) [ revision -- i actually wrote this review before i had given disc # 2 a full listen . there is some really good sh** here -- especially for you breaks/ party dj 's -- that would probably never think to look in a d & b 's producers direction for such trax -- check `` artificial sense '' and `` overchoice '' ] , but cd # 1 has a lot of flavours on it . i 'm not a big 2 step fan , but `` part of me '' is completely addicting . `` problem reaction '' and `` tacky '' -- ( `` ether '' falls somewhere in between 2 step & jungle ) -- are typical klute standouts , and only he and high conrast could even get me in the 2 stepping groove ( if you can call it that ) . according to silly people who do n't have a clue about music , d & b is fading as a genre . but w/ more producers like klute ( and high contrast ) around , it will be here to stay .
