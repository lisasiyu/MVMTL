one of zoot 's best . zoot sims never made a bad album , but he did make a great number that were merely very good . this one , however , is excellent . sims , peterson , and pass all solo beautifully , and the bass and drum team of mraz and tate are behind them every step of the way . the two standout tracks are 'i got rhythm ' , where sims follows an explosive peterson solo with full-throated honks and excursions into his beautiful upper register ; and 'embraceable you ' , when zoot proves that only webster , getz , and hawkins can challenge him for beauty of tone . that said , there is n't a bad track on this cd , and it will give any zoot fan -- any jazz fan -- a great deal of pleasure
