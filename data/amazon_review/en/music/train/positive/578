wonderful experience i had the opportunity to see tom braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader , dunbar middle school ( then dunbar high school ) . `` julian 's smile '' and `` bounce '' are superbly played , smoothe and fresh sound . see him live if you get the chance , buy the cd anyway
