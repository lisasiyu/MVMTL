taking the world by storm i give this album five stars because there are five top 10 hits on it . that 's not her style was a hit but did not appear on greatest hits volume 3 . we did n't start the fire was the first hit from the album . it tells about world history from 1949 ( the year of billy 's birth ) to 1989 , the year this album was released . the downeaster & quot ; alexa & quot ; is about a fisherman 's life on a boat called the downeaster & quot ; alexa & quot ; . alexa is billy 's daughter whose mom is christie brinkley . i go to extremes has the style of billy 's columbia records labelmates , bruce springsteen and the e street band . shameless starts off in a contemporary style and later converts to hard rock . storm front is another boat song . leningrad is a ballad about a russian man named viktor and an american man and his daughter ( possibly billy and alexa ) visiting there . state of grace really rocks . when in rome has listeners & quot ; doing what the romans do & quot ; . then there 's the easy listening and so it goes which is only billy 's voice and piano . the total playing for this cd is precisely 45 minutes
