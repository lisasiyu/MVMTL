my kids love it , and yours will , too i have been `` making '' my kids listen to the music of tmbg for years , but i no longer have to `` make '' them listen . my 6 and 7-year-olds actually `` want '' to listen to songs like `` no ! , '' `` clap your hands , '' and `` four of two . '' although this is not tmbg 's best cd ( some say it is `` flood '' ) , this is my kid 's favorite tmbg 's cd
