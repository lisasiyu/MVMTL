it really is the ultimate italian album i heard dominic perform two songs from his album on mike & amp ; the mad dog and ordered it that day . i knew he was a good singer having seen him perform on the sopranos but i was really knocked out by this album . i love his version of o sole mio and the song from the godfather ( parla piu piano ) but what i really love is the song he wrote song a napoletano . it is the very essence of this cd . the best part is you 'll be serenaded by his voice regardless of whether you understand or speak italian . a great find
