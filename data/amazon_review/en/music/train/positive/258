much , much better ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i first listened to this cd on my work sound system which does not do it justice . i was only mildly impressed and was preparing to submit a scathing review with the main focus being `` mediocrity at its best . '' but then i took it home and put it on a real sound system . voila ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! while i still contend that gerald is infinitely more viable as a premiere session man than a solo artist , this second outing with grp is far superior to `` groovology ; '' the former project seemed to be a classic example of an artist suffering from musician 's block . `` kickin ' it '' is the exact opposite - with help from the likes of jeff lorber and george duke , it appears creativity was at an all-time high with the end result being a wonderful project that you will enjoy over and over again . the arrangements are tight with fresh interpretations , a nice ode to jr. walker and some oh so nice tunes in collaboration with lorber . quite honestly , i have n't been this impressed with a gerald albright project in quite a whie . it appears he is finally hittinhg his stride and i could not be more pleased . niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice , gerald ! ! !
