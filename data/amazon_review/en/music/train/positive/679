almost perfect if you love mozart you will really enjoy this cd . in my opinion sir neville marriner & the academy of st. martin in the fields performs mozart better than any other . the only problem i have with this cd is some tracks on the first cd are recorded live . i have never been a big fan of live recordings . an occasional cough is heard on track 4 which makes me cringe . if only they passed out cough drops that evening i would have awarded this cd five stars . otherwise the music is simply sublime . robitussin anyone
