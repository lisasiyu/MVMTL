as heard in `` kill bill '' ! if the astralwerks label that released this 1973 gem were clever they 'd re-release it with a bright yellow sticker on the cover that says : `` featuring : 'super 16 ' , as heard in the new quentin taratino movie kill bill vol.1 ! ! ! '' then watch the sales of neu ! 2 surge its way up to the top of the billboard album charts , purchased by young hipsters salivating for any and all obscure references incorporated into the cult movie flick . okay , that may never happen , but still , it was quite a treat to hear the brief snippet of `` super 16 '' 's turntable sludge ooze from the speakers of tarantino 's movie . `` super 16 '' might serve a few seconds of quirky soundtrack music , but as representation of the superb , and breif , discography of neu ! 's body of work it does the band a great disservice . hearing this track rekindled my interest in neu ! 's music again , and to write this review . neu ! 2 is perhaps best approached as two halves , the first half , which consits of the first 4 tracks : `` fur immer '' , `` spitzenwualitat '' , `` gedenkminute '' , and `` lila engel '' ( as of this writing amazon 's tracklisting is incorrect ) . this is the heart of the album , with the driving `` fur immer '' connecting the dots between kraftwerk 's motor beats with alternative rock riffing . `` lila engel '' pounds agressively like there 's no tomorrow , years before it became fashionable in punk music . did i mention this music was originally released in '73 ? awesome ! the second half consits of the remaining 7 tracks which , reportedly due to budget restraints , were recorded with minimal material . the band 's solution was to drag or speed up pieces of their own music in various configurations using a turntable ( complete with needle drops and vinyl scraping ) . the woozy `` cassetto '' feeds music through a dying cassette player until its last , wretched gasp . this section of neu ! 2 is remixing in its most primitive form . although it 's an amusing idea to recycle pre-existing material in this fashion , the approach wears itself thin quite early , and hardly justifies any repeat listens . i would say that neu ! 2 is second best behind the band 's self-titled debut ( rating : 5 stars ) , and tied with their 3rd and final ( ? ) effort neu ! 75 , where neu ! were beginning to sound too self-conscious , imho . neu ! 's music has become better with age and surpasses any music out here that is being labeled `` alternative '' these days . it 's good enough for tarantino , and it 's good enough for you ! buy it ! favorite tracks : `` fur immer '' , `` lila engel '' , `` super '' final rating : 3.5 out of 5 .
