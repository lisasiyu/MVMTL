schenker is the professor a recording that will stand the test of time and serve as a reminder of just what a genius schenker is with a gibson flying v. a lot of my friends listened to this cd for the first time and simply said ; `` holy smokes ! where did he come from ? '' i then tell them he recorded this 25 years ago and was way younger than most of them . they were all utterly speechless and now are fans . what a great solo effort and schenker came out of the gates with guns ablazing . incredible material , song writing , production and performance by all band members . simon phillips is a very talented drummer and lays down some serious tracks . highlight of this cd is the solo at the end of `` lost horizons '' , that is mind boggling guitar work that is beyond replication . this is a staple for anyone who follows extreme guitar talent and has an appreciation for master guitar work that will live on as long as music is played . awesome !
