no worries here ! be human does not disappoint ! it has sound quality mixed in with sound fx and acoustic and classical and when i say 4stars i mean it . when i say 5stars i usually mean a ten . were i to do sound for a futuristic play i would feel gratified in using some of this . i think yoko kanno knows the secret of life and she shares her formula ... with us , time-and-time again . i happened to be spoiled on her earlier works and always long for those type masterpieces ; but if i had to choose american rhythm or yoko kanno , i would choose yoko kanno . i wonder if she 's ever been nominated for a grammy ? in my book she 's world-class ! as-i-said-before this cd does not disappoint and there are enough tracks on it to justify four-stars . no worries here
