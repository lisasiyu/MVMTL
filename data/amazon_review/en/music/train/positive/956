john brings new light to his new songs ... i 've always loved the way john mayer takes his songs to the acoustic side of things and this album highlights that talent . the songs have a different feel to them . they do n't sound as deep and emotional as the full orchestrated continuum versions , but ( with the exception of waiting on the world to change - which sounds identical to the continuum version ) both belief and slow dancing ( the two strongest on this album ) have a more personal sound to them . the production is spotless and it sounds as though the album was recorded in the studio as opposed to live , and result is a definite additon to your john mayer collection . the only fault i have is that there is n't a longer track listing
