soul stirring my mother gave me this cd over a year ago and i could n't find any feedback about the album . the album was n't in the stores either . whomever compiled the songs did an excellent job and it touched me like his 1st album did . i played it so much that the cd player scratched it . fortunately , soulife is out now and i can purchase it to support anthony . anybody that loves his 1st will love this one and ai n't nobody worryin ' as well . he is a must see in concert
