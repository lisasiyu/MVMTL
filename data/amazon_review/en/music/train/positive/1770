a joy to hear ! most people are familiar with at least rhapsody 2 from watching warner brothers ' cartoons , if for no other reason . that delightful piece is included but there is so much more ! this is a wonderful album to enjoy . among my favorites is the short but delightful number 11 in a minor . it is a joy to hear but , then again , all of these are . do not expect orchestral arrangements . this is for the piano by itself . listen and enjoy !
