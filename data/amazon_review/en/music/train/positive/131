ok for kids , except maybe one song i have maybe a hundred christmas cds ( it 's a hobby ) but i think this is the only one with the `` explicit lyrics '' warning ! this is fore just for one song `` here comes fatty claus '' which featured a fairly prominent use of the `` sh*t '' word . i have a fairly young child and burnt a copy of the cd without that song . she loves it ! as for the cd ... it 's pretty good . waters has managed to collect the best of campy christmas songs , something unique as far as i 'm aware . but it 's not just a novelty cd ... the songs are good . this is n't intentional camp ... it is sincere stuff with maybe the exception of the tiny time song . ( one of my daughter 's favorite , because it 's well done .
