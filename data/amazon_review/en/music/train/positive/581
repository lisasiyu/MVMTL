fantastic this is definitely one of those albums that you can play over and over again and discover something new and brilliant each time . the lyrics are brilliant , the melodies are beautiful and the music is simply enchanting . shannon mcnally has really found her stride with this album . personal favs include `` pale moon '' `` the hard way '' and her cover of taj 's `` lovin ' in my baby 's eyes .
