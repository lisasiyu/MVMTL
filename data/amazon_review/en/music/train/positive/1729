rubber soul , dark side , stone roses i was initially sceptical of the stone roses and for a long time i never really gave them a chance . however after numerous recommendations i finally decided to giv ethis album a go and found ( to my surprise ) uplifting and repetitivly entertaining album . from the opening of i wan na be adored to waterfall to bye bye badman to i am the ressurection and the bonus track on this disc fool 's gold . what most impresses me about this album is it 's ability to not only keep your intention for 10 minutes plus ( both fool 's gold and i am the ressurection push double figures ) and still leave you yearning for more like the velvet underground 's i 'm waiting for the man you could just keep listening for hours . all in all this is a fantastic album well worth the title of greatest album of all time ( if not close ) , a+ for squire 's boys
