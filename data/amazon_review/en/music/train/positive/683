getting focused art of chill 2 is an amazing divergence from traditional relaxation cd 's . whether i 'm looking for background sounds while reading , entering the relaxation zone or focusing on positive feelings , this 2 cd collection has become a favorite of mine . i 'm a musician and have not been a big fan of electronically created drum or melodic sounds , but when i heard this cd i was attracted to all of the tracks immediately . it 's not too often that you can find an artist/cd where everthing on it has an impact on you . while playing the cd 's working in my office i 'm able to focus my concentration and satisfy my never ending craving for new and creative sounds . if i want to relax and calm myself i 've been able to do so with the sounds on this cd set . jon hopkins is a clever musician and taps into some captivating rythyms , chord progressions , melodies and lyrics . i enjoy listening to this cd as it is my number one relaxation technique on plastic . very captivating , and you 'll definetly chill ; do n't pass it up .
