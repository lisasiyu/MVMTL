winged and soaring to the celestial i see wynton marsalis mesmerized , james brown befuddled , aretha astounded , mariah mortified , beyonce blushing , eric clapton clapping , and pelham goodard ( peegee ) gasping . ahhh yes ! the seven-layer salad of song ( jazz-funk-soul-pop-r & b-rock-calypso ) ... the magic johnson of music . my fav ... ttd 's recurring dream . i luv the metaphysical stories , jimi hendrix-like wa-wa guitar sound , and that cowbell sounding percussion . mad props to we do n't have ... great calypso , holding on to you , supermodel sandwich w/cheese ... so , so funky , as well as all the others . it 's too bad many slept on this work of art . but many slept on ray charles until just recently . although the album title does n't indicate what the song or album is about , nevertheless , it is less than flattering . no other complaints though . definitely an album for the thinking person and introspective . i genuflect out of courtesy and respect .
