personal favorite jimi hendrix is arguably the all time master of the guitar . he has yet to be outdone in spite of the decades since his passing . while i enjoy the sort of hendrix tunes played frequently on the radio , many songs just are n't heard unless one owns the album . south saturn delta is one of my personal favorites . if you enjoy first rays of the new rising sun , or axis : bold as love , any hendrix fan would appreciate this collection as much if not more . play on jimi
