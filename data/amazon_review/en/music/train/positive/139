wonderful stuff.. `` alt-country '' would indeed be a limiting description , none-the-less an accurate point of reference , as this artist is obviously drawing from past country musicians.but make no mistake , this is not a tired retread thru the same-old same-old but rather an exceptional modern piece of music.i 'm usually more inclined towards the heavy than the twangy , but this is just so well written and catchy with a distinct melancholic cloud hanging over the proceedings , and this woman can sing.one of the few recent musicians that deserve that designation
