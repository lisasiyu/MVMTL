this guy is good ... to even begin to describe the music on this cd is difficult ... it 's like trying to describe what god looks like . not only is the music just incredible , but the two female singers have to be the best two voices on the planet . luker 's salve regina had me in tears at the end ( and i am getting all misty eyed just thinking about it now ) . scott 's singing is just remarkable . if angels sing they sound like these two women . for heaven 's sake just buy the cd ! !
