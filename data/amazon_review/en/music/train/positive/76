trippy i bought this cd before going to see mmw ( with john scofield ) for the first time at first avenue in minneapolis dec 7 , 2006 . i had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue 's website . so i bought a ticket and wanted to get `` out louder '' , which i knew they were going to play , to familiarize myself , but the store i was at was out of it . so i bought `` end of the world '' instead . while some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first , i still liked the overall funkiness of it all . then ... .i saw them play . you must see them play ! ! i did n't ever want it to end ! i immediately wanted to see them again ! it 's less than a week later and i have 2 more cd 's ( `` out louder '' and scofield 's `` a-go-go '' which they `` back '' him on ) and 4 more on the way from amazon as i 'm writing this . i 'm like an addict now ! i have to have them on in the car and in the house . i get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they 're on and all is right with my world again . i must say i like `` out louder '' and even `` a-go-go '' better than `` end of the world '' , but only slightly . it is trippy with the synth and the other guest players , and i do like it better after a few listens . i just prefer mmw with less guest musicians
