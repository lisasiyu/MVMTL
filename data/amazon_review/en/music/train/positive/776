the best lp she put out since plantation lullabies this cd was off the chain ! from start to finish . the grooves were tight , the lyrics were full of food for thought , and that voice ... that voice . it 's a melting pot of songs from politics , to sexuality , to love , to self consciencness . she spared no one on every subject she covered . my personal favorites are dead nigga blvd./priorities/earth/and god.fear.money . i did n't like the remix to pocketbook , it was just too loud for a style like hers . but other than that , this album to me is the best she ever put out . buy it , it 's worth it
