review of live show from wayne 's tulsa tour i saw a great show at fishlips in bakersfield last wednesday : wayne `` the train '' hancock . he sang like a modern-day hank williams , and had a great band , just jake on stand up bass , and johnny on the telecaster . wayne just strummed an acoustic guitar , one stroke per beat , but was always right in the pocket , his guitar was holding down the tempo while the electric guitar filled in when he was n't singing , and the bass just kept the beat going like crazy . it is a testament to the trio 's chops that they could inspire someone to dance right from the first song . they had a really crazy rhythm going and it never let up . and there was not even a drummer in the band . the bass player was always pushing the beat , but with perfect placement , and intonation , which ai n't that easy on a fretless stand up bass . wayne played for about 2 hours , and he let his girlfriend gina play a few songs while he took a break . i took that opportunity to get wayne 's autograph . when he got back on stage he sang and talked about all the counties where he was incarcerated . quite a few . i loved the show , it was a prodigious display of musical virtuosity . if you closed your eyes you could have sworn it was hank williams , yet he had his own style , and was n't just a clone of hank . he was what hank would sound like if he were alive and just a little bit older than hank williams iii , his grandson is right now . the songs on tulsa are great , and whether he is live or in the studio , he sounds fantastic . wayne hancock refuses to compromise his music , to sweeten it , to make it more commercial , to do anything other than play music he really feels deep down inside , and to make you feel it deep down inside , too .
