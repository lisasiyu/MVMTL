beautiful guitar a la django sometime not too long ago , bireli lagrene decided to stop running away from his god-given talent to play exactly as django reinhard , and instead embrace it . this record is in my opinion far better than gypsy project , which suffers from some highly irritating violin playing . for some viciously swinging gypsy jazz featuring bireli 's astounding lines , i recommend move ! as well as the even better routes to django , recorded when bireli was 13 years old .
