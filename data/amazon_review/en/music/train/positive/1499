awesome ! ! ! last month i went to drop my car at my mechanics and my radio was playing the cover girls-greatest hits . my mechanic said , `` lady you got class ! ! ! where did you get that cd ? my wife only listens to britney spears '' . i love that cd so much ! it takes me back when i was a teenager at new york going to hearthrob 's , the tunnel , emerald city , and the paladium . boy ! those were the great days ! i also have the collection of the freestyle-megamix . worth buying when you are a true freestyle freak , lol
