crazy s @ # * ! this is a perfect example of modern heavy metal . after realeasing their first album in 1998 and gaining a small cult following , system of a down broke through to the mainstream with toxicity , an album even crazier than it 's predecessor , with tricky time-changes , funky drum patterns , fast guitar riffs with odd tunings , and politcal lyrics sung in such a way that it almost makes light of the world 's problems . where their first album is heavier , this one is more complex . you can find yourself in a groove , only to have it change , and seconds later have it change again . there are lots of mosh-worthy moments , and parts that sound almost middle-eastern due to daron 's style and unique tuning . this album takes a while to get used to , it changes quickly and frequently . john is an amazing drummer and i feel he is too overlooked and does n't get the recognition he deserves . the lyrics have a purpose , at times they will make you think , and at times they will make you laugh . these guys are serious , but do n't take themselves too seriously . in my opinion this is their best work and is a must-own for any sytem fan or metalhead in general , though it may be a little too crazy for some people . system of a down on this album is : serj tankian - lead vocals , keyboards , string arrangements daron malakian - guitars , backup vocals shavo odadjian - bass , vocals john dolmayan - drum
