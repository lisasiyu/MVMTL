joni 's standards although not a document of a working band , this is clearly a record dave douglas wanted to make . following in the tradition of his sextet in honouring the compositions of particular composers , he has drawn together the sympathetic talents of james genus , bill carrothers and billy hart to pay tribute to joni mitchell . hers is music he obviously loves , the reconstructions sounding like jazz standard song repertoire . the other music uses joni mitchell 's ear for a great tune as a springboard for dave 's thoughtful , instantly appealing compositions . beautifully recorded , this is a one-off ; do n't miss it
