pop ( rock/hip-hop ) songs for your girlfriend ( boyfriend & u ) bottom line : a very enjoyable album for anyone with an open mind . girlfriends , boyfriends , single people , married people , old , young , male , female . you probably already know ( and like ) at least 3 songs from this album : `` every morning '' , `` someday '' , `` falls apart '' . so , you 're already off to a great start . and , for those of you old-school sugar ray rock fans , there 's plenty here for you . try `` personal space invader '' , `` aim for me '' , `` glory '' , and `` burning dog '' if you enjoy cranking it to 11 . actually , this album is predominantly rock inspired ... if you 've listened to the whole thing . hip hop fans will find `` live and direct '' featuring krs-one to be a pleasant little surprise . 80 's fans will take to their spiced up rendition of steve miller 's `` abracadabra '' . and , they 've got some nice softer tunes in the form of `` ode to the lonely hearted '' and `` even though '' ( a song which seems to have jumped off the time machine from the 50 's or something ... good stuff ) . and , of course there a bits and pieces of that trademark sugar ray humor thrown about the album . like they always say , sugar ray is all about having fun . period . if things like `` image '' matter to you , then steer clear of this band . if dogmatic adherence to one specific style of music ( and only one specific style of music ) excites you then steer clear of this band . but , if you like having fun with your music ( a.k.a . enjoying it ) and if you can appreciate diverse musical influences , then here ya ' go
