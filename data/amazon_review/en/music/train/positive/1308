listen once , listen twice ... ..listen again . i 'm always looking for good prog rock , experimental etc ... whatever you want to call it . been listerning since the late 60 's early 70 's to everything from zappa , van der graaf , pfm , genesis , t-heads , yes ... .you get the drift . bought this cd ( like many others i 've bought ) just to try something new . my first impression after a few tunes was ... guess this ones gon na be collecting dust ! but , i stuck to it and listened to the whole cd with an open mind . a lot of little things , quirky things , odd things jumped out at me ... some cool melodies , guitar riffs , moments of dissonant chaos followed by structure . music that i honestly ca n't say i 've heard , or imagined before . wow ! this album has grown on me . i 've already bought 3 more or their previous releases and am looking forward to giving in to the unusual and addicting music that is deerhoof
