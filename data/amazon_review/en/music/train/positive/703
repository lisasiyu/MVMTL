hypnotic and fantastic vh1 's we are the 80 's introduced me to this wonderful album . the video for `` running up that it hill '' captured my total attention . i was very delighted to find that the extended version of this song is also included as an extra track . the rest of the cd has multiple and diversified musical surprises . overall and keeping in mind that this is a recording from the late 80 's it is worth the price .
