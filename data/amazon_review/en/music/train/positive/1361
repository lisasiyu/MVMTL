timeless and remarkable when i first heard hatfield and the north back in -73 , the music made a distinct impression on me . i love the sound of this band , with the easily recognizeable sound of the northettes , arrangements rhodes el-piano , solos with the lowery organ ( ***** to dave stewart ) , the sleepy voice of richard sinclair and overall atmosphere . great work , still after all these years i keep this band as one of my favorites ...
