hey , it was good ... well crossfade may just be another modern rock alt metal band but that does n't make them bad . sure , they do n't really add anything new to the music out now but that should n't take away from the music itself . all i know is from what i heard they have some really good tracks . i first heard the track `` cold '' on the radio and it was just one of those songs that i love instantly . i just had to go out and get the album . after getting the album it turned out to be pretty good . i pretty much enjoyed everything on here . although , my favorite tracks would have to be `` cold '' , `` starless '' , `` colors '' , and `` dead skin '' . here 's the track ratings ... 1 . starless - 9.5/10 2 . cold - 10/10 3 . so far away - 9.5/10 4 . colors - 10/10 5 . death trend setta - 10/10 6 . the deep end - 9/10 7 . no giving up - 9.5/10 8 . dead skin - 10/10 9 . disco - 7/10 10 . the unknown - 9/10 overall : 93 % a- sure , it 's not really anything new but it is good and a nice listen . i enjoyed this album very much and am very curious to see what crossfade has done with their new album that was just released . anyway , anyone who 's into this style of music will probably end up finding a bunch of other good tracks for their music collection .
