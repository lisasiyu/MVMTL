i am wierd ok ... .see if you can make sense of this ... my favorite bands are radiohead , the cure , bauhaus , talking heads , kraftwerk , and dan fogelberg ... ..so , where does his sound fit into this genre ' of music ? it doesnt ... i just happen to love this guys voice and his tunes ... .my favorite one on here is same ol lang syne ... oh my god , i melt when i hear this ... .i have to admit , lots of his music is sentimental to me due to my childhood , but i listen to him pretty much every night when i go to bed..i think his music is beautiful ... ... peace :
