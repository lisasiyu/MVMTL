just get this cd and you will be happy ralph stanley is a god of bluegrass and this cd shows us why . the man 's voice has such character and presence and power . the music is as good as bluegrass gets and the harmonies are great . there is a good variety of music on this cd . from barn burners to slow mournful dirges , its all here . you wouldnt think that an album full of songs about death would be uplifting , but it is . highly recommended
