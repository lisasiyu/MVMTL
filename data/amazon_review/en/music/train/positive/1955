blast beats from hell ! i must admit i bought this album for the cover alone . i must also confess that i had never heard of belphegor . i was browsing a mom and pop record store looking for hard to find cds and in their new release section i came across `` pestapokalyspse vi '' . being a fan of death metal i decided to give it a try . i 'm always looking for new bands to get into . i am very glad i gave these guys a whirl . the best way i can describe the sound of this album is that is seems to be a strong combination of norwegian black metal and death metal . the heaviest aspect to this record in my opinion is the drums , there are ton of pummeling blast beats that are just relentless from these german dark lords . as heavy as belphegor are they also have a strong sense of melody . after the first two tracks of pummeling death metal the band then slows down a bit with the track `` angel of retribution '' . there is some pretty impressive guitar work on this song . there is also some really dark demonic like chanting on this record which to me belphegor could write the soundtrack for an omen film . in my ignorance i thought this was new band but i believe they have 2 to 3 releases before this one . after hearing `` pestapokalysevi '' i would definitely pick up some of there other records . my suggestion to anyone who is into death and black metal to pick this one up , belphegor are a great combination of the two styles of extreme metal . some of the highlight tracks in my opinion are `` hell 's amassador '' , `` pest teufel apocalypse '' and `` seyn todt in schwartz '' . this is must for any extreme metal head . a brutal hidden treasure of 2006 .
