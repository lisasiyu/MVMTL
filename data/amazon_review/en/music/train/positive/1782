jane eyre : the musical from an theater fan 's perspective before i tell you all my opinion about this musical , i would like to comment that my recording is slightly different than the one here online . my is the original canadian cast . the cover has a gnarled tree against a blazing sunset on it ... very interesting . for the most part though , the songs are the same . some things have been added , taken out , or modified . anyway , i got mine at a flee market and could n't wait to listen because i was a fan of the famous book . i listened and was slightly disappointed with it . marla schaffel ( i might have spelled her name wrong ) has a gorgeous voice and plays the part of jane very , very well . i have n't heard the man who plays mr. rochester on this recording ; i have only heard anthony crivello portray him . although the cast matters a good deal , in this musical 's case , i believe the score and lyrics count a tiny bit more . some songs are truly disgraceful , however , there are several that stand out . my favorites include 'as good as you ' , 'painting my portrait ' , 'secret soul ' , and 'in the light of the virgin evening ' . i would probably have more favorites if i had heard this recording ... unfortunately i have n't had the pleasure to hear 'the orphan ' , 'sirens ' , 'finer things ' , or 'rain ' . the music is over all very good once you become accustomed to it . the real quality that stands out in this musical are the lyrics . lyrically , this play is absolutely brilliant . even if you ignore the music and the voices ... just listen to the words and you will most certainly be moved . being that jane eyre is adapted from a novel , i expected that the lyrics would be predictable and insipid ... everything they are not . over all , i can enjoy this play for not only the musical wonder , but the breathtaking lyrics . thanks to those of you who took the time to read my review ! do any of you viewers agree
