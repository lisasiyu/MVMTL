amazin , reminds me of the byds an excellent album . i am a fan of `` i can hear the heart beating '' and `` then nothing turned into somethin '' . this cd is entirely different . yo la tengo pulls a complete 180 , and sticks mainly to covers mixed with some original stuff . it has a misty , thematic feel to it , a certain aura of perfectly arranged acoustic guitar and slippery vocals . `` what comes next '' evokes the byrds , especially their `` notorious byrd bros. '' phase . an excellent buy , sit back n enjoy
