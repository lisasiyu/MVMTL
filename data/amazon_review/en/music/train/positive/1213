this is a great cd . alan is one the best country singers today . when i first heard & quot ; she 's got the rhythm ( and i got the blues ) & quot ; i began to like it . he can sang romantic ballads like : & quot ; ( who says ) you ca n't have it all & quot ; a top ten hit in early 1994 . the songs i like on this album are : & quot ; tonight i climbed the wall & quot ; , & quot ; mercury blues & quot ; , 1993 's big number 1 hit & quot ; chattahoochee & quot ; . you 've got to buy this album
