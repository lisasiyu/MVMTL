delivering that murda muzik this is their forth album , it came out in 1999 when i was 12 , my boy aaron kept playin this album and i got annoyed and i asked him if i could borrow it and he let me hold it and then i can see why he kept playing it , the beats are addicting , this is when mobb deep started to go a lil commercial not too much but they still kept it real , its not ass dark as hell on earth or the infamous but it should n't stop you from listenin to this album , this is a good album but its not the same as thir ealry material , also for mobb deep or qb fans y'all should check out the murda muzik movie , it was supposed to come out back in 1999 but kept gettin pushed back , so it finally came out in 2004.recommmended for fans of mobb deep , qb hip hop , ny hip hop , late 90 's hip hop.standout tracks are streets raised me ( reminds me of junior high school days when i used to live in ny ) , what 's your poison ( featuring cormega , he murdered this track spittin that fire ) , adrenaline ( nice dark organ sample ) , quiet storm ( brings me mad memories ) , thug muzik ( produced by alchemist featuring the infamous mobb ) , the realest ( produced by alchemist featuring kool g rap , one of the illest collabos ) , usa aight then , it 's mine ( i used to play this song a lot ) , and quiet storm ( remix featuring lil kim ) .also mobb deep y'all should bring it back to murda muzik beats wise or hell on earth on your next album
