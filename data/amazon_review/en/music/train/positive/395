sly brings the funk again ... this album is one of the main reasons why i do n't buy the argument that everything recorded by sly stone after `` fresh '' is n't worth listening to . i bought this disc with low expectations , but after one listen i was convinced that this album was overlooked . to me , `` high on you '' is like a more upbeat `` there 's a riot goin ' on '' . it almost seems like this album had the same production quality with the funk format of heavy bass , keyboards , backup vocalists , and driving beats . the main difference between the two albums is the lyrics : sly seemed to be in a much better mood when this one was recorded . this disc seems a little looser and jazzier too . the instrumental `` green eyed monster girl '' is a good example , with a funky keyboard solo that sprawls over the entire four minute track . the liner notes indicate that sly had a heavy hand in the recording of `` high on you '' , stating that he played `` everything - ? ! ! '' . it makes sense then that this album was credited to him rather than sly and the family stone . however , this album seems to have been dismissed , which is a shame . this may not have been his most memorable work , but this is a damn funky album and i ca n't find fault with that .
