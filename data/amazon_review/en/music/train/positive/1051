welcome back , sonny . in 1962 , it had been three years since sonny rollins had released a record . frustrated with what he felt was his own limitations , he took sabbatical to work on his form , practicing at the williamsburg bridge . this odd habit led to his comeback album being named `` the bridge '' . a quartet record featuring guitarist jim hall , bassist bob cranshaw , and drummer ben riley , invariably this album and it 's story is the stuff of legends , and deservedly so . rollins is on fire throughout -- playing mostly standards ( with only two originals ) , it sounds as if he was itching to get in the studio again , his playing is powerful , focused ( `` without a song '' ) , lyrical ( one of the definitive readings of `` god bless the child '' ) and emotive ( `` where are you ? '' ) . rollins ' support is generous and sympathetic , particularly on `` god bless the child '' , where cranshaw in particular feels like he 's breathing in time with rollins . all in all , a worthwhile effort , and an essential point in rollins ' catalog . it also may be the best place ( either this or `` saxophone collosus '' ) to begin exploring rollins ' catalog . highly recommended
