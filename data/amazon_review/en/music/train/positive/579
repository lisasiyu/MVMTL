a child 's celebration of rock 'n ' roll my daughters and i love this cd . it is fun to sing along and we have a great time listening to it . i think that the songs provide my children with exposure to older music which is much different from the sounds they usually listen to . we really enjoy it for how fun and invigorating it is to listen to
