the best score i 've ever heard ! carpenter really knew what he was doing when he got walker to help with the score . makes super background music for quake ii . the sounds are far more detailed than in efny . it 's the bomb , as they say . i 've had it for two months , and i still get a kick out of the main theme and the motorcycle chase . kudos , carpenter
