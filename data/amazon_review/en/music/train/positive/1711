i 'm not one to promote celine dion but ... . because she 's like adult contemporary and i 'm not supposed to like her because i 'm not part of her target demographic but damn this cd is great . it 's not surprising that the grammy 's picked this as album of the year . even the upbeat songs here are not bad for celine . it 's a crime most of these songs were never released because they are so good , in my opinion , even better than her massive titanic hit song . my favorites are falling into you , i love you and dreamin ' of you . i do n't own any other celine 's albums but i 'm glad i have this one
