should be much bigger , all over the radio that these songs are not already all over radio proves that radio is bad for music . good lyrics , great musicians , sincere , complex rock and roll that rarely sounds overdone . buy air stereo , then buy bastards of the beat , then call your local radio station and get this music out there . i 'm thinking wild stallions kind of world changing power here !
