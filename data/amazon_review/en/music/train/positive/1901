heavy metal chuck berry . was reborn when i heard this . i used to be a heavy metal rocker in my teens , but hearing it now is a whole 'nuther experience . you cant fault the raw energy of this band , they smoke ! it 's balls out , no nonsense , bread n butter rock music , no gimmicks . check out the movie ( let there be rock ) and see the experience ! angus 's striptease is hysterical and consolidates his place as one of rock 's true characters . he is essentially chuck berry on speed ! bon was a true gravelly dude . my mum used to work at a salon called scissors in the 70 's and her college 'silver ' used to date bon , so she got to meet the boys a few times . when she cut angus 's hair , he apparently said nothing and drank 4 pints of milk during the process . a real school boy to the end . i love this band and i love bon 's smutty lyricism , too . r.i.p
