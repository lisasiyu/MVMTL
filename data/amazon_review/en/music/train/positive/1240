a fantastic set of music this is a hard swinging blue note session from the late 50 's . it features a classic line up of clark on piano , john coltrane on tenor , curtis fuller on trombone , donald byrd on trumpet , paul chambers on bass , and art taylor on drums . all of the artists are comfortable in the session and no one musician dominates the set . the selections are arranged as to give everyone room to stretch and explore the collection of standards and clark originals . sonny 's light , nimble touch is on display throughout the session . his solos are well worth listening to several times and swing on each track . curtis fuller has a warm , tender solo on the standard come rain or come shine , and coltrane shines on speak low . everyone gets room to blow on the uptempo opening track , with a song in my heart , with byrd 's bright brassy trumpet leading the way . finally , clark 's compositional skills shine thru on the classic that closes the set , news for lulu . this is another great blue note & quot ; connoisseur & quot ; reissue of a & quot ; lost classic & quot ; , it gets one star automatically for putting all of the alternates at the end of the album instead of stringing them behind the master takes . i recommend this set as a classic straight ahead swinging hard bop date , especially to fans of the & quot ; blue note sound & quot
