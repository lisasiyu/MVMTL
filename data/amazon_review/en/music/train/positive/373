please keep talking , joan joan rivers is an american original and this cd captures her at her peak . clever , brilliant , brash , outrageous , controversial , joan was ahead of her time but stays timelessly hilarious on this cd . if you like joan , you absolutely must get this - i am so grateful to have found it on amazon.com ! i originally heard this & quot ; album & quot ; when it came out in the early '80s and have loved it ever since . joan rules !
