best since doggystyle in my opinion this is snoop 's second best album even today , behind you guessed it , doggystyle . that said it is n't even close to being as good as doggystyle , but it is still a good album and after da game ... and the slightly dissapointing doggfather this can be viewed as a comeback almost . da game ... . featured no limit production and loads of appearances by no limit rappers , and as a result was wack , both have been cut back here . snoop must have put his foot down and asked to bring in his own producers for no limit top dogg , including of course dre , for the first time since doggystyle . there are also less no limit rappers ( any is too many though ) featured , but surprisingly few appearances by his old west coast homies . anyway best track is easily b*tch please , which is a classic in any era , snoop 's verses are tight but xzibit is really the star of this track , as he makes what was really his mainstream breakthrough . my other top tracks are buck em , just dippin ( both dre produced unsuprisingly ) , betta days , down 4 my nig*az and trust me . snoop also displays his impressive storytelling abilities on snoopafella , where he basically re-tells cinderella from his perspective . most of the other tracks are at least good , and the production for the most part is tight , though the album is not without filler ( gangsta ride , in love with a thug ) . overall this is an impressive album from snoop , yes it is not doggystyle , i do n't think there ever will be another one . people have the tendency to mark snoop albums against doggystyle , rather than on their own merit unfortunately though . i 'd give it 4 stars , recommended
