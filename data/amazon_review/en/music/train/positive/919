one of the best albums of the year.. this new album by former mr.big guitar player paul gilbert is a nice surprise ! beatle-esque melodies coupled with good leading and backing vocals , not forgetting the intrincate , fast melodic guitar riffs and chops make this a delicious cd . highlights include the first track & quot ; get it & quot ; with its infectious theme and the ballad & quot ; kate is a star & quot ; . listen to flying dog and have a good time
