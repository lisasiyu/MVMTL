auspicious debut this is a great debut album from a very talented canadian artist named amanda marshall . she 's had big success in canada , but not so much in the us . i do n't understand why that is , and if you listen to this cd i think you 'll agree with me . there was 6 big singles from this album , and even the non single tracks are awesome . the closing track `` promises '' is stunning and raw in emotion . `` let it rain '' was the first single and it 's definately a powerful song that resonates with listeners , a song about searching for redemption . `` dark horse '' was also a big hit . `` birmingham '' is a great song about a woman in an abusive relationship who finally leaves her man . `` fall from grace '' and `` beautiful goodbye '' were also singles and other favorites of mine . i highly recommend checking this cd out if you have n't already
