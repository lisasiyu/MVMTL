lyrically brilliant , musically great too ! i have to admit , it took me awhile to actually enjoy relient k. i used to think their music was very generic and their lyrics were cheesy . but this album changed everything for me . matt thiessen is such a clever lyricist , using enough word plays to delight the wordsmith in me , but also making me think more deeply about my relationship with god and others . the band sticks to their standard pop-punk riffs on this album , though i believe they use smoother speed and instrumental transitions on this album . example : be my escape starts with screaming guitars and a fast beat , softens down to keyboards , vocals and light drumming during the verses , back up to rocking during the bridge and chorus , and slows right down for a touching finish . there are several other songs that vary in a like manner . lyrically , i really enjoyed be my escape ( but the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair ) , which to bury , us or the hatchet ( i move you , but you just would n't budge , i tried to hold your hand but you 'd rather hold your grudge ) , when i go down ( when i go down , i 'll lift my eyes to you , but i wo n't look too far , 'cause you 'll be there with open arms , to lift me up again ... ) . what a beautiful way to end the album ! musically , many songs stand out - high of 75 is probably the most original song , starting with acoustic guitar , and including a drum loop in the chorus . other highlights include who i am hates who i 've been , and life after death & taxes , which combines great vocals with some cool screaming ! relient k has made a fan out of me , and if you buy this album , it will do the same for you
