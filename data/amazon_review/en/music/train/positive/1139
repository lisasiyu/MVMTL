reeves at his best if you are tired of the usual guitar playing , with all its already extremely used ways , but do n't want to give up listening rock'n'roll , you really should get this album . not only a guitar player , but also a songwriter growing after each work , he can give you rock at the best level , and at the same time showing something new , that will not sound strange to your years . that 's a difficult task you have to admit . and if you think that this is all , you should get his last online album & quot ; ulysses ( della notte ) & quot ; even better than this
