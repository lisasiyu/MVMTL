this cd is hhhoootttt i dont know what some of these people are talking about up here dissing mr bobby v 's cd's..this cd is nothing but the truth for this to be his first solo project and to only have one guest apperance he held this cd down very well and i give him all the props in the world his and a few other r & b cds are the only ones that i can actually listen to from start to finish without wanting to skip any tracks..and as far as the girl buying this cd over her book for school your a dummy for that one you need to get your priorities str8 then ... .you should have been worried about your darn education more so than a darn cd..you may have hated this cd..but bobby has already made it..have you
