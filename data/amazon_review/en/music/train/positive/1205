great release ! ! despite the very obvious issues with overdubbing , this is a great release form the sisters . an album after being absent for 14 years ? ! what more can any clark fan expect . i 'm surprised to see contributions from karen and dorinda in terms of writing . since twinkie has been writing the music for 30 years , i figured that the case would be the same . what a nice surprise . karen and dorinda are both great song writers .
