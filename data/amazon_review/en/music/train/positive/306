back to my childhood oh my goodness ... .i had this on a vinyl lp back when i was a very young teenager and nearly drove my parents crazy with it . i listened to it 3 times a day for about two years ... .about 700 times or more ... when i was 14 and 15 . now that i listen to it again , i see it was terribly formative for me , a major influence on my life . i never realized how much the lyrics interweave through my psyche even now , miles away , years later ... .buy this and it will change your life
