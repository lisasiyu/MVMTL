great disc ! i remember that i had the lifetime on cassette 20 years ago and never grew tired of it . i have always been a big holdsworth fan and he really shines on this stuff . the second half of the cd i had not heard before and was disapointed that it had taken me so long to discover these tracks . fantastic stuff a must if you are a fan of either tony williams or alan holdswort
