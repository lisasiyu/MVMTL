one of the best jazz recordings of recent times dave douglas 's music is touched by genius . he seems always to be ploughing his own furrow , playing the music he wants to play and with partners of his choice . his impeccable taste and unique compostional style come from a deep understanding of jazz and contemporary music . this recording is probably my pick , but all come highly recommended . his sidemen know how to listen , the empathy is astonishing , it really is a joy to hear . i look forward to catching him on tour in england this spring
