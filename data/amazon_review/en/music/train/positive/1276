lou 's last gem.. this is the last really good album that lou reed made in 1990 . he captures the feel of his new york and you can visualise what the dirty boulevard looks like . lou is at his best when he plays tough and on new york his hard edged urban lyrics really hit the spot . for velvet 's fans , im going to rate this 3rd of lou 's solo efforts behind transformer and take no prisoners
