the american art song lives ! please do n't be fooled into thinking that mr. bucchino writes only `` theater '' music . his songs are true art songs that can grace a recital stage . i have included `` unexpressed '' in my recital repertoire . not only is his music well written , but it is far from easy to perform and does indeed require the same attention to detail as any good art song . this album was a real surprise and a joy to hear some of my favorites performed by other artists - another perspective from which to draw . just two words : buy it
