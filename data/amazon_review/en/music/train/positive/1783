excellent - but no substitute for seeing them live ! i love this album . if you are a jam band fan you will love this cd/album . some one i know thought it sounded a lot like the grateful dead when i played it for them . i bought this cd after seeing them for the first time live . they are a great band and are very `` together '' with their sound . found this cd addictive and never seem to get tired of it . great buy ! i only put 4 out of 5 stars because they are still better live than the cd .
