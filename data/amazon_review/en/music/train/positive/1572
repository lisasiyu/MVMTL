a good collection this release by `` 20th century masters '' is part two of their loretta lynn greatest hits compilation . this one covers the second part of her career , and like vol . 1 , the sound and recordings are clear and original . there are 12 songs here , beginning with `` wine , women , and song '' and `` fist city '' , and ending with `` i lie '' . in between , there is a duet with conway , and the controversial `` the pill '' . yes , there could 've been more songs included , or even more popular songs chosen instead of those provided here , but this is a solid offering that will not disappoint
