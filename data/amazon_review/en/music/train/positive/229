worthy sophomore effort out of exile , like the debut , rocks out of the blocks riding a rolling riff that once again confirms that these guys are actually steeped in classic hard rock folklore . again we see rick rubin twiddling the knobs for a fine selection of mature hard rock . chris cornell is again in full possession of a voice capable of putting all sorts of feeling into his lyrics . indeed the fact that cornell writes all the lyrics is interesting - the fact that this band has had to work out how to operate after their still talked about former bands was another hurdle these dudes had to get over . lucky for us that they did . this second instalment of the audioslave story sounds much like the first which is no bad thing . the riffs are so smooth - who let the 70 's back in ? - and the band show full well the way to alternate rockers with mellower stuff . this album does fell a little mellower overall . not sure if that 's why the album flopped to a certain extent in certain territories but the band have corrected the slight problem of too many tracks that affected the debut . this ablum probably shut some of the naysayers up . sure it 's sales were n't up there with the debut but it 's as consistent as the first album and it 's showed that this band were a serious proposition and not just a one off project and that 's a good thing as hard rock needs such gimmick free bands in the mix as a foil to some of the more hysterical bands out there . in the final analysis this is a four star release for those who like their hard rock from talented players and full off rollicking riffs for the melodies to ride along . token non musical gripe - why the dull/crap cover
