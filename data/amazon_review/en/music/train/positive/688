do n't be so harsh on ann i understand that many of you who have bought this cd will be broadway lovers ( and i am one myself ) and you will be used to the lead roles having amazing powerful voices . but just as important as good singing is good acting . i think that ann interpreted roxie as a wannabe who had the enthusiasm but lacked the talent , which makes her raspy tones and sing-speak completely plausible . it also supports the theme that you can use other things than talent to get yourself to the top this may not be the way you like roxie played , but you should n't shun ann 's interpretation . it 's a good thing if there is more than one way of having a character played , i think so anyway . personally i love the miramax film , but i enjoy comparing these 2 and seeing the differences
