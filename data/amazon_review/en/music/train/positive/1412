beautiful voice , catchy songs . though i am not a fan of pop music , the beauty of ofra haza 's voice lured me in . this album has wonderful songs in an almost 80s-style pop music with `` middle eastern '' influence . the lyrics are moving and deeper than typical pop music , complete with a voice that is unique to just about any genre
