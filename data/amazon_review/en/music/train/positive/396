'kaleidoscope ' is 'good stuff' i got this cd as soon as it came out . the song `` caught out there '' was catchy and did n't sound like anything i had been hearing on the radio . kelis intrigued me with her unique vocals and wild multi-colored hair . i listened to `` kaleidoscope '' so much that i got sick of it and sold it . big mistake ! i want it back and i ca n't seem to find it anywhere . `` kaleidoscope '' is definetly a good r & b album and my favorite songs are `` caught out there , '' `` game show , '' `` suspended , '' `` ghetto children , '' `` roller rink , '' and the spanish-esque `` i want your love . '' this cd also exposed me to the neptunes and their signature sound , which is well known by now . overall , this is very good music
