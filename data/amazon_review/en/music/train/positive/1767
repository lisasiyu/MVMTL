ultimate christmas album mariah carey 's 1994 album merry christmas is the ultimate christmas album . she breathes new life into standard songs like silent night and joy to the world . her voice is in peak form , hitting her five octave range - and i swear for this album - six . on this new release , one side is a cd , the other has all her charming christmas music videos . the label warns that the cd side will not play in all cd players unless it is a sony , but it played fine in my non-sony cd walkman as well as my gateway pc dvd player . there are two engaging secular songs here , `` all i want for christmas is you , '' and `` baby please come home for christmas . '' but the real power is in the classic hymns and carols . her versions are so full of joy and reverence for jesus our saviour . i get tears in my eyes when i think of the christ child coming to earth - the real reason for christmas
