orpheus sings this cd is true poetry , full of metaphor and metonymy . i have never become tired of listening to this poetry , the evocative moods and desolate yet soulful landscapes of loneliness . the pieces are timeless quality , and its musicality provides a backdrop for the lyrics rather than being intrusive . truly a remarkable work of art
