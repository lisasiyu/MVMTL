fun ! this is a very fun album . of course `` jukebox '' makes you want to dance no matter where you are . but if you only listen to the singles you are doing yourself a disfavor . bent fabric has really crafted an album and you will be rewarded for listening to it front to back . the only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the album is pretty short . even with it being padded out with a few remixes ( which are good and appreciated ) this runs under 60 minutes . on the other hand its refreshing to just get the good stuff and not have to flip past padding tracks . do n't get me wrong , this album is worth your money , especially if you are a fan of dance/dj music . very fun and a great party album you can throw on and leave play without worring about bad tracks ruining the vibe
