not my favorite when i started listening to pompougnac i fell in love with the music . some of my friends told me to start with number 5 , i bough 3,4,5,6 , and 7 the same day ... thank god because number 5 was the one i liked the least ... do n't get me wrong it is a beautiful cd and the songs are great but not the best of them ... 6 and 3 are the best for me so i recomend to start with number 6 then 7 and then any of them ... .i have the whole hotel costes collection and it is just amazing . stephane is a genius ...
