young cats ( or ill-informed ) just do n't know ... the main reason in this review is to express my amazement and disbelief in several individuals reviews discrediting c. wilson for his cover of `` let 's chill '' . this whole album is banging , and for you young cats , here 's a little history : `` let 's chill '' was released by guy in `90/'91 , ( of course everybody knows teddy riley 's name - if not , come on now , you need to educate yourself on one of the top 5 producers of all time ... ) . who in guy sang `` lets chill '' ? aaron hall . who was aaron hall 's inspiration ? matter of fact - who was aaron halls entire vocal style based on ? who did aaron hall himself admit to admiring growing up and mimicking his style ? charlie wilson . it 's even been quoted that `` ... even his vocal distinction is strangely similar to that of charlie wilson , a member of the r & b/funk group the gap band '' . if you are a rookie , please listen to the old gap band albums , and you will see who aaron hall sounds exactly like - lead singer charlie wilson . i actually give more props to charlie wilson for still being able to continue to release albums and make hits , while aaron hall seems to still be in that black hole of nowhere for quite a few years . moving forward , with the new `` lets chill '' remake , charlie is really just putting it down just like guy did , except with the same style that aaron hall bit off of him . man , maybe it 's just me , but i think a lot of people putting reviews on here really do n't really know their music..
