hip music 101 `` ocean 's eleven '' is one of those few movie soundtracks worth having . the disc features an eclectic blend of music with the unifying theme of hipness . the cd is as cool as the movie . the hit is of course 'a little less conversation ' which became the theme song to the nbc show `` las vegas . '' the exposure eventually dethroned 'viva las vegas ' as the city 's choice elvis tune . very few soundtracks have made such an impact . under the general umbrella of jazz , the disc features lounge , acid jazz , big band and even orchestral music . it has a choice blend of swaggering vintage sounds and sophisticated modern music . at the same time , the album finds balance between time tested classics and original music created for the ocean 's eleven project . the disc will have high appeal to instrumental enthusiasts . while the soundtrack would be stronger without some of the film 's dialogue , such a product would n't be difficult to create in the day and age of cd-r burners . `` ocean 's eleven '' is a hip journey worth taking .
