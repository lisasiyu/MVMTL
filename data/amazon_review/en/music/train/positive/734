some great country music by a great singer/songwriter ! when i first heard `` the dollar '' on the radio , i was floored . not only by the touching lyrics , but also by the traditional sound . i could tell that the guy singing it had a deep love for traditional country music , and was someone who stayed true to his roots . after listening to this album , i still say all that . the dollar is a great traditional country record . sure , there are the contemporary `` redneck anthems '' -- '' rebelicious , '' `` redneck side of me , '' even to an extent `` keepin ' up with the jonesin '' -- but they are still better than a lot of their cousin songs . johnson 's true country gift , however , comes across in other ways . the enjoyable `` flying silver eagle '' is one of the countriest songs i 've heard in a long time ( `` i could n't put my past behind me , so i put it in a song '' ) . `` she 's all lady '' is a touching tribute to the woman at home , and `` back to carolina '' is a powerful number . `` my saving grace '' is an ode to the power of blood over alcohol ( `` daddy passed out with his demons , mama passed the offering plate ... daddy kept the devil off my back by taking up his time '' ) . the cd ends with the stirring and inspirational gosel number `` lead me home . '' jamey johnsom , from all appearances , seems the direct musical descendent of george jones , hank jr. , merle haggard , waylon , and others -- he 's a traditional-leaning artist with what may come off as attitude , but what is really , in fact , simple honesty . the dollar is one of the best country albums i 've heard in a long time . yes , yes , he 's the guy who co-wrote `` honky tonk badonkadonk , '' but for true die-hard country fans , johnson is more likely to be remembered for the tunes he recorded here ... and any more he gets the chance to record in his career . his voice is undeniably country , his writing skills are formidable , and his taste in traditional country music is unwavering . god -- and the music industry -- willing , jamey johnson will have a long career ahead of him . lord knows , he 's the right man to give country music a much-needed injection of traditionalism
