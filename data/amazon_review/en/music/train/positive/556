an excellent sting collection after leaving the police in 1984 , sting launched a hugely successful solo career , garnering top selling albums and a string of top forty hits . in 1994 , a & m released `` fields of gold : the best of sting 1984-1994 '' , a 14 song collection containing almost all of sting 's hits up to that time as well as some new recordings . well , 10 years has passed since its release , and sting has made some new recordings . so the question is , how does `` fields of gold '' hold up ? here are the positives and the negatives . positives : -if you 're a casual fan only interested in having sting 's radio hits , than this collection is for you , as it includes `` if you love somebody ( set them free ) '' , `` fortress around your heart '' , `` be still my beating heart '' , `` russians '' , `` we 'll be together '' , `` all this time '' , `` if i ever lose my faith in you '' and `` fields of gold '' . so basically , all the hits you could possibly want are here . -the sound is great . -it is a very afforable and easy to find compilation . -it includes some songs recorded for the album that are only available here . they 're all good songs , especially the hit single `` when we dance '' . negatives : -this collection is missing a top twenty hit : `` love is the seventh wave '' reached number 17 in 1986 . that 's my main caveat . - '' mad about you '' was never a single ( at least in the u.s. ) but received a lot of airplay , enough to warrant inclusion on this cd . -some of these songs are remixes . however , they work , though i prefer the original version of `` we 'll be together '' . -no liner notes . -as i said , this collection is leaving out later hits like `` i 'm so happy i ca n't stop crying '' , `` brand new day '' and the top twenty hit `` desert rose '' . so if you want to get those songs , you 'll have to get the albums they 're on . overall , `` fields of gold '' holds up very well . it is completely unneccessary for hardcore sting fans ( unless they 're completists ) , but if you 're a casual fan , than you must own this collection
