wow . i have always been quite a hard core indie fan . i cam across my first otis redding song 'try a little tenderness ' when i was watching the 80s teen flick , pretty in pink . it struck me as being one of the most emotional , moving and captivating song i had heard in a long time . it caught my emotions exactly at that moment and now remains a song that is very precious to me . i would like to say thank you to otis redding for opening my eyes to different varieties of amazing music , and for creating this incredible album . as someone said before , it is a shame we lost him at such a young age as he had such a unique talent , but i am thankful his music remains to keep his memory forever
