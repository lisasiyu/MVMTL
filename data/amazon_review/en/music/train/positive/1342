wow ! ! ! i 've got a few of the colosseum cd 's and i 've never been terribly impressed with them ... but this incarnation of the band is something else entirely . they take a much more rock approach and prog it out with fantastic results . the pace is driving and speeds along with purpose and supreme musicianship . every song is full of intricate time changes , killer solos , and great vocals . the second disc is a fine addition to the original . there 's no sign of a filler cut ... it 's all outstanding stuff ! a nice surprise , overall . i 'm hooked
