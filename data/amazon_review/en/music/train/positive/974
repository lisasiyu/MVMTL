amazing results i had a very colicky baby from 2 weeks old to 10 weeks old and this was the best cd of all the ones i tried ( classical , lullabye , ocean sounds , television , etc ) to calm my baby and most importantly , to keep him sleeping longer . the last track was his favorite , the sound of the rain . he sleeps so much longer now that i play that track on `` repeat '' all night long . and i can get things done during his naps because the rain sound covers up the noise of me in the kitchen , etc . and , when he is really cranky and there 's nothing else i can do for him , i can put him down in his bed and play the whole cd from start to finish and it calms him and puts him to sleep 75 % of the time , which is a huge improvement from other attempts .
