a solid album being a newer fan to anti-flag and only catching their albums ( the terror state and for blood and empire ) i will admit my ignorance along the lines of their earlier work with what little i know of it . something that i have noticed with a large majority of the negative reviews about this album is how they view the political aspects of the album and of the band , as well . is this not a cd ? does the cd not have music . how about having a critic on just the music itself like how many of the songs have strong messages and i 've been hearing some impressive bass parts along with very catchy songs . i do n't know who crass is and i do n't care . it 's all a matter of opinion and if you do n't like the album , that 's your deal . i think it 's pretty solid . though , i will say this . something that i have never liked about anti-flag is their music is so limited . you can only write so many songs about the same topic before it gets old . something that i have always appreciated with bands is versatility with writing songs . so far from what i 've heard , it 's just all politics ... though that is the path that anti-flag has chosen to take and they have stuck with it ever since . so kudos to them
