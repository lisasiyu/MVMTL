70s pop reigns thanks to alan , wayne , merrill , jay and donny this release includes all ten of the brothers ' top 40 hits from 1971 to 1974 ( `` one bad apple '' through `` love me for a reason '' and `` the proud one '' ) plus two additional cuts : `` i ca n't stop '' and their version of `` he ai n't heavy . '' the 1992 greatest hits compilation on the curb label is essentially the same disc minus the two additional tracks . `` i ca n't stop '' was recorded in the late sixties back when the brothers were regularly on television on andy williams ' weekly variety show . the song was released after `` one bad apple '' topped the national charts . the flip side of that number one hit was their remake of the hollies ' hit `` he ai n't heavy , he 's my brother . '' that tune was eventually covered over the next few years by many artists , including neil diamond and olivia newton-john . if you do n't already own the 1992 hits disc or the three disc box set released in 2000 ( also on the curb label ) then this is the compilation for you . you may also want to get your hands on the other two recently released `` 20th century masters '' collections : one covers donny 's solo hits of the 70s plus the other disc features his hit duets with sister marie from the same decade
