a dark masterpiece ! `` berlin '' , which was reed 's follow-up to his highly succesful ( both musically and commercially ) 1972 album `` transformer '' , showcases a radical change in reed 's direction . whereas `` transformer '' was a mostty light and musically catchy album , `` berlin '' is a more complex and darker album ; both musically and lyrically . no tracks have the commercial appeal which characterized many tracks on `` transformer '' , and the album contains no new hit-singles . the album works much better to be listened to as a whole , and only few tracks are suited for `` best of '' compilations . songs like `` caroline says '' and `` how do think it feels '' would be the most obvious selections to put out . this does n't mean that this is not good album ; on the contrary ; it may be his artistically most successful . musically it 's very varied in style and instrumentation . the `` berlin '' theme seems to have influenced the arrangements of the two opening tracks ; especially `` lady day '' ( kurt weil ) . the songs are generally longer than on reed 's two previous albums , but you are never bored when listening to the album ; and once you have gotten to know the songs , you 'll notice that it is really a very melodic album , with no unimportant tracks . this is reed 's dark masterpiece
