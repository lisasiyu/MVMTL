ma-an ! too much talent for the spoiled youth to bear ... i have good instincts , folks . just like all of you who 've already givin ' this a glowing review . i checked this out from the library a few days ago and was immediately floored . so much so that i 'm thinking about not reteurning it ; telling them i lost it an ' just paying for it . i 'm amazed at the gracefulness that comes across when you put together two so distinct an ' so different voices . louis ' scratchy , gruff , yet likeable an ' melodic croon an ' ella 's smooth-as-silk , soothing an ' intoxicating voice incredibly , to me , go perfectly on these duets here . from that first opener 'let 's call the whole thing off ' , done so sly an ' flirtatious on both parts , to 'gee , baby , ai n't i good to you ' to the ever-engaging 'autumn in new york ' and 'stars fell on alabama ' one of the greatest standards ever written ( `` and in the center just you and me , my heart beat like a hammer , my arms wound around you tight , and stars fell on alabama last night '' ) . that is what romance is , kiddies ! oh , an ' i ca n't forget 'summertime ' . ahhh , yes , 'summertime ' , with that opening trumpet that tugs at your heart strings and makes you wish for days of love , happiness , sunlights an ' flowers ; a world of beauty that should never be taken for granted . yeah , i know what you 're thinkin ' ; `` there he goes , layin ' it on thick again . '' well , i ca n't help it . in a time filled with the most repugnant excuses for music i 've ever heard in all my soon-to-be twenty-five years , it is a shining gift that this music has been preserved for us who truly appreciate talent and genius . there 's no show-boating here , no bone-headed braggadocio , no studio gimmicks . this is what music is .
