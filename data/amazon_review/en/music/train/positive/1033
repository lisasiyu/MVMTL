silver 's ode to japan as the review below states , `` the tokyo blues '' is one of horace silver 's best albums . but with all due respect to mr. jones , let 's write reviews that tell the people a little bit more about the cd they are thinking about buying . recorded in july 1962 , six months after a successful and impressionable tour of japan , `` the tokyo blues '' is silver 's way of saying thank you for the generous hospitality he received while on the other side of the pacific . each of the disc 's five tunes has a title that refers to an aspect of japanese culture or tradition . but do n't think silver went so far as to incorporate japanese music on this album , for this is classic hard bop from one of the master 's of the genre . the band here is the famous quintet of 1959-63 ( blue mitchell on trumpet , junior cook on tenor sax , gene taylor on bass ) with one exception -- john harris jr. replaces roy brooks on drums , who was ill at the time of this session . while `` the tokyo blues '' may not quite live up to `` song for my father , '' it is as good as anything else this quintet cut , including `` silver 's serenade , '' `` finger poppin '' and `` blowin ' the blues away .
