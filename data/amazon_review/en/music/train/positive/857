pretty good this band is pretty good i think it had potenial to become better & quot ; bonethrower & quot ; is prob the best song on here but i could be wrong all of the songs are worthy and could be hits its alot better than limp bizkit and puddle of mudd which come from the same record company as these guys ... ..but i put this band in the standards of soundgarden which is saying alot if you like soundgarde
