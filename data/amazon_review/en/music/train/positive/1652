dark ? sad ? difficult listening ? i dunno about all that ... throughout the reviews for `` bone machine '' , you 'll see warnings that this music is harrowing , obsessed with death , `` not the place to begin with tom waits . '' pshaw . this album makes me grin ear-to-ear , all the way through . this one contains some of tom 's most lovely ballads : `` who are you '' , and the amazing `` a little rain '' . it has some of his funniest lyrics : `` murder in the red barn '' comes to mind . `` cause there 's nothin ' strange about an axe with bloodstains in the barn there 's always some killin' you got to do around the farm '' the poetry on `` bone machine '' is truly ( to use an overused phrase ) , mind-blowing . hell , i might even go to church if they sang honest songs about mortality like the chillingly beautiful `` dirt in the ground '' ! `` the ocean does n't want me '' is his best spoken word piece ever . `` jesus gon na be here '' just flat rocks out . be clear about this : `` bone machine '' is not background music : it demands attention . but the bottom line : be not afraid . strap on the headphones , pour a tall glass , and take the ride .
