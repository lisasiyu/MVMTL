electronic soul music there are still those that claim that electronic music is soul-less . its made by people on computers who are n't necessarily musicians and do n't play any real instruments , therefore they say it lacks the human element that other genres incorporate to move their audience . well for those of you still trapped in that mindset i invite you to check out `` one '' . not only does this record defy that thought but it should enhance your opinion of the capabilites and potential of progressive electronic music . i was not aware of dierdre prior to this solo debut however her previous projects were i believe more world/ethno music in nature . `` one '' is truly a blend of electronic , techno , world & soul and even flirts with the lighter side of drum and bass . the vocals needless to say are nothing short of breathtaking . highlights are the opener `` waiting for spring '' , `` close to us '' & my personal favorite `` a way to love '' . also included and i believe the 1st emphasis track is an unrecognizable cover of the moody blues `` nights in white satin '' . this record is truly fantastic in every regard and a great reminder of how good electronic music can be
