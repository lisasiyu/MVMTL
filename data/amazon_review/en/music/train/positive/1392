not fair ! how can anyone write so many great songs ? c'mon people , plunk down the forty-five stinking bucks and experience the unearthly genius of robert pollard . if you are already a fan , there is no excuse to not have this . as one might expect , this is not the starters place to look . bee thousand , alien lanes or the safer ( more normal sounding ) isolation drills would be the best choices . nice packaging , good booklet . excellent liner notes . pick your favorite 20 or 25 songs and make the ultimate gbv disc . what a joy the suitcase is .
