another great recording , keep on playin ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! a recent rolling stone issue listed the 100 greatest guitarists and omitted this fine ( probably 1 of 10 or so , blues greats ) performer . though it is hard to be totally objective as i have both seen and met this great guy on a few occasions , there really is no one who plays as well or has this tone . he is a fantastic blues and jazz virtuoso , and is certainly headed for greater recognition . i prefer his own writing and that is what kept me from giving this 5 stars as there are a couple of covers included here that are not of the same caliber . thank you , robben for another very good recording/perfomance
