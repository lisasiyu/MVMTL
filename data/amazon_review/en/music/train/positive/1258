`` something 's lost , but something 's gained ... '' this cd contains both studio re-recordings of earlier works ( `` judas '' , `` dandelion '' , `` anna '' , etc . ) as well as new songs . i have some sympathy for ben fassett 's earlier comment . those who have heard antje duvekot 's earlier works ( `` little peppermints '' and `` boys , flowers , miles '' ) may be surprised by her sound in this cd . i was fortunate enough to hear her live in concert the other night , and was completely impressed by her presence and performance . her earlier cds convey the power of her solo performance ; think patty griffin 's `` living with ghosts '' as a comparable example . paradoxically , less is more . this cd , on the other hand , adds string arrangements and other instruments to her voice and guitar . i think that some of the raw emotion and poignancy can get lost in the production , and her voice can occasionally be muted . in her concert , she performed some of the new songs from this cd , and they were very much in the style of her earlier cds . the earlier cds also reveal her live demeanor which is quite shy , humorous and self-deprecating . you should really try to see her in person if you have a chance . on the other hand , this cd represents more antje duvekot , and that is never a bad thing . it is still well worth the purchase , but consider also `` boys , flowers , miles '' to hear the power of her solo voice
