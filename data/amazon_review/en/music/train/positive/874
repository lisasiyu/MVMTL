a wonderfully innovative and orginal cd i was downloading some shows when i came across a show by some band called galactic . i liked it but did n't think much about it . then last week i saw counting crows and live in concert . when i got there , there was this band jamming out . i saw the second half of their set , all the time wondering & quot ; who are these guys ? & quot ; then they announced that they were galactic . the next day i went and bought this cd and i could not be happier . the blend of funky blues-like singing , jazzy horn play , and the rock guitar riffs is awesome . this band reminds me very much of a jazz trio called medeski , martin , and wood . however , galactic offers great singing and horns giving them a much more diverse sound . for me , this is one of those cd 's that i do n't know any of the song titles because whenever i listen to it , i listen to the whole thing straight . if you like jazz and you like jam bands , get this album
