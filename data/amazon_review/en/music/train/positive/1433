my favorite christmas music i have had this videocassette for years and its so worn i 'm so glad to finally get a cd ! jewel 's voice is beautiful and some of the classics like joy to the world and o little town of bethlehem are the best versions i have ever heard . i could have done without the non-traditional songs which do n't quite fit into the holiday arrangement or match the beauty of her voice but its well worth the purchase for gloria , o holy night and ave maria . if you like to sing along , i highly recommend it .
