the world-class hall of fame supergroup of all time ! the flamingos are my all-time favorite group ever . extraordinary harmonies , impeccable timing , and intricate arrangements characterize every beautiful recording by this amazing world-class group . the flamingos have a unique and timeless sound which has often been emulated but never duplicated , and most likely never will . they have left an enduring legacy of music for millions of people to enjoy . may god bless them all
