astounding album from the brilliant chris de burgh throughout his musical career , chris de burgh has offered albums filled with beautiful , creative and imaginative songs . the storyman carries this idea to its zenith with a collection of incredible tracks . `` one world '' is the perfect expression of spiritual and secular equality . performed and sung beautifully , it is one of de burgh 's finest moments . the heart wrenching `` the shadow of the mountain '' and uplifting `` raging storm '' are both utterly beautiful . `` the sweetest kiss of all '' is a touching love song with a fantastic melody . `` the mirror of the soul '' is classic storytelling in musical form while `` the storyman '' is a synopsis of all that is de burgh and his career in one song . the album , as a collection , is complete , cohesive and well recorded . each track stands as an example of the best in songwriting from practically any artist in popular music . i am personally devastated by the power and beauty of this album . chris de burgh has impressed me once again . it 's an incredible musical accomplishment
