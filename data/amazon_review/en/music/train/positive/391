true love at first hear los lonely boys , the self-titled album by three twenty something brothers from texas , is jam packed with indescribably beautiful music that 's one part rock & roll , one part country , one part chicano , one part lullaby and 200 parts stone-cold gorgeous . because i 'm a big hip hop fan who loves pavoratti , i do n't often find myself in this aisle of the music store . ( and by the way what aisle is this ? ) but a friend gave me this cd and after letting it sit , collecting dust for over a year , i popped it into the stereo on a whim . what a wonderful surprise . almost like love at first hear , i found myself bopping along to literally every tune , as though i had grown on this music . these guys are amazing singers , musicians and song writers . bilingual , they often switch back and forth from english lyrics to spanish ad libs . plus it contains two versions of more than love , one in english and the other in spanish -- which reminds the listener of their texican roots . double sided , this cd features 12 songs on one side and 8 videos on the other . some are acoustic and reveal just how talented ( not to mention charming ) this band is . because i know so little about country , rock & rock and mexican-twinged music , it is almost impossible for me to accurately liken this band 's sound to anyone else 's , but if forced to i 'd say sting . not because it sounds like sting 's music , but because it has that same soothing lullaby feel that comforts and convinces you 've heard these songs all of your life . plus the writing is smart and the rhythms infectious . -- regina mcmenami
