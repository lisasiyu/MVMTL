nice collection from a great singer jimmie rodgers had a wonderful , reedy tenor . he was a first-rate singer . the surprises here are the lesser known songs that are beauts , for example tlc tender love and care , child of clay ( which reminds me of elvis 's in the ghetto ) , and especially the lush and soulful wonderful you . the last mentioned song is a real treat , absolutely delicious . three songs missing that i would like to have were his versions of just a closer walk with thee , the wreck of john b. and the world i used to know . hope someday jimmie 's a & amp ; m releases will be out on cd too . in the meantime , i recommend this collectio
