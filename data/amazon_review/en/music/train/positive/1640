very smooth although i usually preffer more energetic d & b this album really caught me by surprise . the beats are so precise and well executed . i really enjoyed the amount of control that photek had over the music . do n't go in thinking this will be dieselboy or dj db because it 's not . it 's an entirely different beast . it 's a bit more along the lines of polygon window mixed with amon tobin 's walls of sound . it 's a really great album to relax and read to . some of the tracks can be a bit stale but most of them are pretty great , especially track one ( it 's my fav )
