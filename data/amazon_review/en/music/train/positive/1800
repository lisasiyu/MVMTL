a greatest hits masterpiece a lot if not most greatest hits collections have some hits and some padding.not this album.this is one great collection.the five songs tacked on at the end made this album a must own masterpiece.if you like al green 's 70 's output , you will like this cd.every single song is a classic.ol skool al green fans ( like myself ) might already have at least a couple of his albums already , but this cd sums up why he 's soul legend . p.s . : do yourself a favor and pick up some of his 70 's era albums starting with `` i 'm still in love with you '' if you have n't already
