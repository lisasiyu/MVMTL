greg lets his finest come to your ears ... . if you are familiar with greg brown , you probably are familiar with this release . if you do n't have it , get it and treat yourself to an experience that take you on a journey of loves lost and loves to come . for those who are curious about greg 's work , this is an excellent place to start . there is not a bad cut here , and in particular , & quot ; dream cafe & quot ; , & quot ; spring wind & quot ; and & quot ; laughing river & quot ; are a trio of songs that somehow work some sort of magic into allowing me to see into life a bit deeper for a period of time . two other releases that go along well with this are & quot ; further in & quot ; and & quot ; the poet game. & quot
