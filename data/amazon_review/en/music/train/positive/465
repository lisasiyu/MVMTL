lang is fresh jeff lang gives a fresh and personal voice to the blues . another reviewer complains that he is n't son house or robert johnson and so forth . yeah , this is what ... 60 years later ? a blues fan for many years , i get tired of guys that ca n't look beyond their dusty old records and nostalgia for an era that they did n't live in and perhaps did n't quite exist . son house is fine , but he had limited musical talent . jeff is not only technically talented , he brings a fresh personal message into a style that has too long suffered from a lack of innovation
