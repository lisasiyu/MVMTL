maiden keeps on churning out the greatness once again maiden brings it all and creates another masterpiece . aces high is no doubt one of the greatest opening tracks ever , followed by the live favorite 2 minutes to midnight another solid rocker . the middle of the cd is filled with solid songs , that are all pretty much straight forward rockers . then comes powerslave which has one of my favorite solo portions . then it ends with rhynme of the ancient mariner , the second best epic they have . this would be a good introductory album for people new to maiden . up the irons ! !
