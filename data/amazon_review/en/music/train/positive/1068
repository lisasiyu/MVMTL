greatest modest mouse album this is by far modest mouse 's best album . it is hard for most people to understand at first . this album has a whole different feel to it than the rest of their albums . this was the first modest mouse album i ever heard , and i could n't get into it and did n't want to at first . but a friend convinced me to sit through it 3 or 4 times , and now i ca n't get enough of it . do yourself a huge favor and buy this album . close your eyes and listen to it all the way through one or twice , and if you still do n't like it , you have poor taste in music and you suck . if you love this album like i do , you 'll also love the ugly casanova album titled sharpen your teeth . another great modest mouse album is the fruit that ate itself
