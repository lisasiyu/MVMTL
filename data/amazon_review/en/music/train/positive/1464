fluid musicainship , great catchy tunes , a gem of a disc jeff golub and his crew have got a relaxed and polished style- in the light jazz vein of say bob james or the & quot ; crusaders & quot ; they move from funky tunes , thru soulful ballads and on to rousing infectious uptempo grooves . this is really enjoyable instrumental work , familar but never hackneyed . the musicianship is exemplary , tight and inspired throughout . i 'd put this disc in my top ten of the past three years- highly reccomended
