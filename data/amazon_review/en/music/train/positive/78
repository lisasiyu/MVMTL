please enter a title for your review : i 'm going to avoid focusing on the politics involved here and focus on the music . go to the moveon.org and musicforamerica.com sites and judge for yourself whether they 're causes worth giving money to . if so , read on , if not , browse for something else . though primarily focused on `` indie '' acts , this album is still pretty diverse , which can be both a good and bad thing ( whose idea was it to follow up a typically jazz-pop-rap track by will.i.am from the black-eyed peas with they might be giants ' cover of william henry harrison 's 1840 's campaign song ? ) . highlights include the aforementioned tmbg song , okgo 's surprisingly subtle cover of the zombies `` this will be our year '' , former soul coughing vocalist mike doughty 's `` move on '' , laura cantrell 's haunting rendition of country classic `` sam stone '' , and the late elliott smith 's `` a distorted reality ... '' , soon to be available on his posthumous album from the basement on the hill . the problem lies in too many live/alternate versions of things ; the `` acoustic '' rendition of fountains of wayne 's `` everything 's ruined '' improves on the far too muted original from their debut album , but the blink 182 remix is barely different from the original ( which is n't a good song to begin with ) , the bright eyes live track is gratingly drawn out , and the yeah yeah yeahs live version of `` date with the night '' is too murky to really capture their manic live shows . as a compilation , this album has a few flaws , and is a bit overstuffed with alternate versions and live material , but overall it 's got enough good material to warrant purchase if you like at least a handful of the bands involved , and again , you believe in the cause .
