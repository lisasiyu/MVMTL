haunting ... mesmerizing loreena 's voice on this and every album is amazing - so perfectly suited to celtic music . the first song i ever heard her sing was `` the lady of shalott '' ( played on public radio in nc ) . i had to stop the car and close my eyes ! buy this album and every other album of hers - i 'd be very surprised if you were the slightest bit disappointed
