the greatest show on earth most of em 's fans think that the marshall mathers lp is his best work but i beg to differ . the eminem show is his greatest album for many reasons . 1-he handled all the production except 3 songs ( `` business '' , `` say what u say '' , & `` my dad 's gone crazy '' ) all of which was produced by the great dr. dre , 2-he kept all guest appearances to a minimum , 3-his flow improved greatly . the best song has to be `` square dance '' , a song that show how well he rides the beat with ease . let 's hope em can put out another album that can match the intensity of the eminem show . top 5 songs 1 . square dance 2 . say what u say f/ dr. dre 3 . say goodbye hollywood 4 . when the music stops f/ d12 5 . til i collapse f/ nate dog
