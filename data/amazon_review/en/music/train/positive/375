just wonderful ! i really loved this cd . i am not normally a fan of classical music , but this is more like a pop cd . andrea 's duets are absolutely fabulous . you forget you are listening to what is classified as classical . it is very enjoyable & i suggest all andrea fans get this one , but they probably already have . hopefully with this cd , andrea 's music will be introduced to people who are pop fans & they will start to buy his music & become a fan , as i have
