pop rock gem ! it continues to amaze me to find `` new '' musicians who record in bedroom studios all across the country . everyone was amazed when craig chaquico pulled this off , roger takes it to the next level . the closest event i can recall to this release is steely dan 's 1972 `` ca n't buy a thrill '' that put pop/rock on its ear . the influences are many and varied ... beach boys , beatles , osmonds , neil sedaka , jimmy webb , the who , styx , yes , chicago , alan parsons , elo/jeff lynn , astrud giberto , wondermints , burt bacharach , supertramp , 60 's brit pop , the list goes on ... as for roger 's vocal ability , he 's no bocelli , but he is better than 90 % of the front men out there . he has a unique `` honey '' styled voice with a smoothness not often heard these days ( think joseph williams , david pack , donnie osmond , gerry beckley ) . he does n't try to imitate anyone , and has learned to be comfortable using his instrument as intended and well trained . primarily a keyboardist , his chops on guitars and drums are commendable as well . ca n't think of enough good things to say about this artist . not every cut is excellent , but eight of eleven are standouts and addictive . the three deleted cuts from solid state warrior make for eleven very strong songs that could all be at home on the top 40 ... during some point of time . buy this cd now
