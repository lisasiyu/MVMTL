hits the spot . in terms of nu-metal , this is definitely one of the best albums in this genre in a long time - if not ever . this is far from generic , as some of the other reviewers has blatantly stated , although some of the songs do sound run-of-the-mill and dry in places . overall , though , this album is full of creative melodies and structures that you just do n't find now-a-days in the 'nu-metal ' scene . do n't settle for the garbage that 's out there , this is a talented band with a unique sound [ those guitars ! ] and a great album . if you 're into nu-metal but are starved for creativity and originality , pick this album up . it 's not perfect , but it delivers .
