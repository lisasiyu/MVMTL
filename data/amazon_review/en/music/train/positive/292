the most eclectic album i 've heard in years , and the best . i came to beastie boys on the back of vague recommendations from a mate , not knowing what to expect . initially , i got licensed to ill , which i enjoyed for what it is , but it was not the stuff i had been recommended . i moved to check your head , and was pleasantly surprised at songs like pass the mic , so what'cha want , live at pjs . since then , i have been absolutely blown away by this album . there is no other album i know of that combines punk-rock , metal , acid jazz , funk , world beats , and hip-hop , in the same album , sometimes even in the same song . and it makes for a great mix . not only is this album a great mix of styles , but it is produced crisply , with the vocals mixed down slightly to become an accompaniment to the rest of the instruments , synths blending seamlessly in and out of the music , and the tribal beats laying the foundation for some great songs . the beasties manage to record and mix accordingly for the style of each song style they attempt . and they attempt a lot . songs like 'the update ' , 'futterman 's rule ' are a psychedelic funk-fest , with tribal world beats as a backbone , synths everywhere and funky guitar licks , i cant help but love them . songs like 'sabotage ' and 'heart attack man ' make for a change of pace , with great punk metal riffs , and fast heavy drum beats . my personal favourite simply for its ingenuity and awesome sound is flute loop ; who else but the beasties could take a folk sounding flute riff , and bring it into the hip-hop world with funky beats , mad scratches and mad lyrics ? no one , thats who . ultimately , there is something here for a fan of every type of music.i recommend this album to anyone who loves funk , punk , hip-hop , or jazz . my recommendations are : the update , futterman 's rule , flute loop , sure shot , heart attack man , b-boys making with the freak freak . enjoy
