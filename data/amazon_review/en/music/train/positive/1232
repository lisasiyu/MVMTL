a treasure trove of memorable late '70 's hits & quot ; super hits of the '70 's - have a nice day vol . 21 & quot ; contains yet more of those '70 's power-pop top 40 tunes you 've come to know and love . this collection focuses on the late '70 's - specifically late 1977/early 1978 . ram jam 's & quot ; black betty & quot ; kicks things off into high gear , with an unmistakable southern-rock , hard-edged flair . as the autumn months of '77 rolled around , moviegoers had n't quite gotten their fill of the box-office mega-flick & quot ; star wars & quot ; , which was released in theaters earlier that summer , so a discofied rendition of john williams ' original score was released - this version by meco titled & quot ; star wars theme/cantina band & quot ; , which hit the billboard charts big-time and made it to number one , as well . the los angeles-based group player reaped adequate rewards from their first single titled & quot ; baby come back & quot ; , released during early '78 . player 's success was short-lived however , and saw just two more singles enter the charts during the course of the year , and disbanded soon afterward . the absolute worst song of all time appears on this collection - meri wilson 's & quot ; telephone man & quot ; . whoever had the foresight to include this clutter here had to have been on battery acid , as it is just plain horrible and incredibly insipid - which is why & quot ; have a nice day vol . 21 gets four stars instead of five . now that we 've gotten that senseless , moronic & quot ; tune & quot ; out of the way , let us continue onward . ex-spirit and jo jo gunne member jay ferguson , who had a hit with the former group and sang lead on the single & quot ; i 've got a line on you & quot ; in the late '60 's , contributes here with his only solo chart effort & quot ; thunder island & quot ; , released in the spring of '78 . if it 's wispy , sentimental ballads that you crave , there 's dan hill 's & quot ; sometimes when we touch & quot ; , a major hit in both the u.s. and canada also during the spring of '78 . for a howlingly good time , ghouls , ghosts and goblins will have a frightfully good time with warren zevon 's & quot ; werewolves of london & quot ; . moviegoers in the winter of '77/'78 will recognize ex-bread frontman david gates ' & quot ; goodbye girl & quot ; from the movie of the same name , which was released in april of '78 after the motion picture 's release . wales 's bonnie tyler had her first big hit with & quot ; it 's a heartache & quot ; during the summer of '78 , as well as did michael johnson with his hit - the melancholic tear jerker & quot ; bluer than blue & quot ; . before exile jumped the pop ship into country music waters , they hit it big with & quot ; kiss you all over & quot ; , written by two of the group 's members - mike chapman and nicky chinn , who became songwriters and mega-producers for other artists during the late '70 's and early '80 's . finally , to round out this collection of chartbusters , there 's walter egan 's top twenty smash & quot ; magnet and steel & quot ; , which also features backing vocals courtesy of fleetwood mac 's lindsey buckingham and stevie nicks . as far as & quot ; telephone man & quot ; is concerned , i felt rhino could have utilized better singles for this collection from that era in its place , such as dolly parton 's & quot ; here you come again & quot ; , or firefall 's & quot ; just remember i love you & quot ; ( both released in autumn of '77 ) , to name a few , although there are several other singles from this time period that could have definitely gotten the nod over & quot ; telephone man & quot ; . even though we 're stuck with tm , & quot ; have a nice day vol . 21 & quot ; is still a good arrangement of superbly crafted pop tunes to have in your cd collection at any rate . a must have for completeists of this 25 volume series
