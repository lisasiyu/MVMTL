new age supertramp anyone ? ok i ca n't myself here , but this guy really listened to a lot supertramp growing up or something . i liked to album , but i can hear hints of supertramp 's style in about half the songs here in different degrees . `` bad day '' probably the most notable of the bunch really sounds like something that came of the `` breakfast in america '' album to me . still the album is enjoyable though , especially if you did like supertramp . i get the leo sayer hook , but i think it 's off a bit . leo never used that many keyboards
