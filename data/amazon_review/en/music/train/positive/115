excellent , ten-star children 's music record ! an outstanding set of kid 's music with folk scene stalwarts such as arlo guthrie , taj mahal and tim o'brien joined by bluegrassers tim o'brien and rhonda vincent and blues pickers keb mo , guy davis and eric bibb , as well as americana-country types such as rosie flores ... an impressive lineup , sure , but better still is the calibre of songwriting , and the actual kid friendliness of it all . this is a really fun album ! fun , as in , little kids might actually like it , and might even sing along if you played it for them . plenty of silly songs like `` bling-blang , '' `` bananaphone '' and `` bellybutton song . '' some songs are perky , like `` red , red robin '' ; others are instructive , like `` man named all the animals , '' and others still model assertiveness and communication skills , like taj mahal 's excellent `` do n't you push me down , '' in which various kids stick up for themselves in unpleasant situations . i like this album a lot , and plan to play it for my kid for years to come
