a nice reference copy bernard roberts is someone who i 'd characterize as a master crafsman who can be relied on to give a good interpretation of the works without taking them over ( e.g . like a glenn gould ) . the result is not just good listening but its makes for a recording that 's an invaluable study aid for anyone who 's trying to learn this material . since the 48 are not just pieces of music but bach 's demonstration of styles and keyboard technique -- something that dr. roberts seems to understand very well -- you end up with a lot more than some cds , a plastic case and a few sleeve notes ... ... if you could only figure it all out , of course
