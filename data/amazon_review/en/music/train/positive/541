what a great collection of songs from a great band ! first of all i love the pet shop boys they take me back to the decade of the 80 's with this collection ! ! ! ! each song has a untique flavor to them and they are so much fun to listen to again and again ! ! ! ! ! with the beginning of the album which would be `` west end girls '' to `` jealously '' ! ! ! ! ! ! if you love the pet shop boys then go buy this album not because of the band , but for the great 80 songs that take us back in the day ! ! !
