the start of a string of brilliant works this is , perhaps , the rolling stones ' masterpiece . after the disaster that was `` his satanic majesty 's request '' the band clearly decided to stop slavishly copying trends ( and , one might add , following in the beatles ' footsteps ) . brian jones appears only sporadically , it 's his last album with the band . the stones brought in jimmy miller to produce , after having learned the hard way that they work best when they have someone besides mick and keith at the mixing board . nicky hopkins ' contribution to this album ca n't be understated . rumor has it that ry cooder participated in the sessions . `` sympathy for the devil '' kicks things off . for an inside look at the evolution of this iconic song see jean luc godard 's `` one plus one '' ( aka `` sympathy for the devil '' ) . this song was scary and groundbreaking back in 1967 - now that we 've all heard it 1,000+ times it seems far too familiar . in my opinion this is one of mick 's best lyrics . `` no expectations '' is a beautiful song , with lovely piano work by hopkins . the lyric is a bit trite , but it works . believe it or not this was the first single - it 's perhaps the weakest song on the album . `` dear doctor '' is really , really funny . the stones were fans of country music , but here they take on the form as a cliche . `` for the gal i 'm to marry / is a bow-legged sow / i 've been soakin ' up drink like a sponge . '' this is a hoot . `` stray cat blues '' - another reviewer stated that this is a homage to fans of the band . jeez , i hope not ! this is very creepy stuff . mick 's growls in the intro are absolutely filthy ( `` yeah , just do n't care ... '' ) . he sings this like an utter pervert , which is the point . `` well i can see that you 're 15 years old / but i do n't want your id . '' by now it 's obvious to the listener that the stones have reinvented themselves - where did this sound come from ? it 's unlike anything we 've heard on previous stones albums . `` jigsaw puzzle '' - many fans do n't care for this song . it 's a bit of a throwback , somewhat reminiscent of `` something happened to me yesterday '' and a few others from the previous incarnations of the band . mick 's lyric is a bit overwritten , but the final verse in particular is quite good . the band jams out well here - keith , wyman and hopkins play off one another brilliantly , particularly in the coda . it 's a fine side-ender . `` street fighting man '' - some of this was recorded in a living room . the basic drums are charlie banging on telephone directory books . some of the guitars were recorded on a cheap tape deck . the sitar is brian ; more amazing hopkins piano here . this was , i believe , the start of keith using the famous `` open g '' tuning he has employed since . a solid song , but i 've always thought it a bit over-rated . `` prodigal son '' - country blues , based on the bible story . mick 's lyric is perfect , as is his vocal delivery . no contemporary british band could sound as authentically american when doing this style of blues . `` parachute woman '' - more blues , but now we move from the delta to the big city . bill wyman has often referred to this is his all-time favorite stones track . the sound is ( purposefully ? ) muddy , and it feels perhaps a bit off-hand at first listen - but give it a chance . this is powerful stuff . `` factory girl '' - an underrated gem . it 's a beautiful song with a lilting melody , a fun yet poignant lyric , and a wonderful performance by all . `` waitin ' for a girl who 's got stains all down her dress / waitin ' for a girl and my feet are gettin ' wet / she ai n't come out yet / waitin ' for a factory girl '' - that 's as fine a depiction of working class life as i 've yet come across . `` salt of the earth '' - the first verse is keith richard 's first lead vocal on record . this is a stirring song , an apt followup to `` factory girl . '' i was n't at all surprised that this was a song mick and keith chose to perform at `` the concert for nyc . '' the vamp in the last 1/3 or so of this song is brilliant musicianship . if one is familiar with the rolling stones only as a `` hit '' group , this album could be disappointing - there 's no obvious top ten hit here . but if you appreciate music , and if you know anything about the history of this group , you will appreciate the fact that this was a groundbreaking album . there is n't a bad track here . each is brilliant in its own way . and , of course , this was the first of five great albums produced by the stones - `` beggar 's banquet , '' `` let it bleed , '' `` get yer ya ya 's out , '' `` sticky fingers , '' and `` exile on main street . '' they had never before reached these heights - and never would again . the rolling stones are regarded by most fans and critics as contemporaries of the beatles and bob dylan ( `` the holy trinity '' of the 60 's ) on the strength of the five albums noted above . they had a lot of hits before `` beggar 's banquet , '' but if that was all they 'd done they would be regarded as equals to the animals or the yardbirds , etal . they became rock royalty when they produced `` beggar 's banquet .
