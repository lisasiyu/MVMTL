though uneven and definitely not for everyone , `` adventures '' is an influential album that ambient fans will love the orb 's `` adventures beyond the ultraworld '' was essentially one of if not the first ambient house album ( it at least inspired other artists and ( somewhat ) popularized the genre - `` little fluffy clouds '' is a very appealing track ) . it is , admittedly , a little uneven . if you 've only heard the song `` little fluffy clouds '' , be prepared for a quick change of pace . the rest of the album is very ambient and very experimental , but for ambient fans and the open-minded it 's very interesting stuff to listen to . my personal favorites are the first three tracks , and the rest i do n't think are as fun to listen to as a whole ( they 're definitely very good , though ) . it 's not ambient in a traditional sense - there 's definitely a beat in most of the songs which help keep them accessible . what 's also great is how you 're essentially getting two albums for the price of one ( actually more like the price of 1.5 albums ) ! if it were n't for this fact and its influence on the world of music , i probably would 've given it a 4.5 . ambient and electronica fans will definitely love it , though . even if most people wo n't like the album as a whole , they 'll most likely enjoy `` little fluffy clouds '' . highly recommended ! highlights include : the entire album
