two great collaborators two geniuses waller and armstrong were of the same generation and were collaborators in music in the 1920s . louis 's first big leap to popular stardom beyond the tight group of jazz musicians and performers came when he introduced `` ai n't mis behavin ' '' on the broadway stage . the audiences often forced him to do three or four encores . folks who had seen the show before would pay full price just to get in to hear louis sing this one song . the recordings in the late 20s by louis with all the vocals are simply my idea of the best music ever recorded by anyone . rather than get them selected this way , you might want to get one of the cds or collections that covers that period of time with everything , rather than just the songs by waller . likewise , while the all stars were not as good as his original chicago and new york groups , particularly these later all-stars ( i prefer the albums with the great jack teagarden ) , if you get into the music you will want that all too . at any rate , there is no one else but louis who can do these songs justice except the fat man himself , mr. waller
