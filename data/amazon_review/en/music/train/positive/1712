go froggy go ! ! ! ! ! ! you did n't think you 've seen the last of `` the annoying thing '' , did you ? well now he 's back and better than ever with an all-new album featuring the new hit single `` we are the champions ( ding-a-dang-dong ) '' based on the song by queen . other songs include `` i will survive '' , `` ice ice baby '' , and `` copa banana '' . in comparison to the uk import album , the us album exclusively has revamped versions of eiffel 65 's `` blue ( da ba dee ) '' and rednex 's `` cotton-eyed joe '' , two of my favorites . the uk album , however , exclusively has froggy versions of `` i 'm too sexy '' and `` the final countdown '' , as well as the full version of `` go froggy go '' , the bizarre `` crazy jodeling '' , and the even more bizzare `` nellie the elephant '' . also there 's `` super crazy sounds '' which sounds so totally mixed up and around , if you know what i mean . either way , i like this new album a whole lot . better than the first , even
