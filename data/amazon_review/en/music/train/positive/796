a surprised non fan i am not a fan of the carpenters but when i was younger ( 25 years ago ) i knew a lot of their songs but considered my self a `` rock and roller '' without a decent gear to listen to . with good equipment on hand now and collecting albums of my youth in sacd format , i decided to buy this one and was surprised that the remastering was one of the best i have heard . i am a stereo only person because i do not find the hometheater enjoyable . i tried it for 5 years ( from 1991 ) but did not get the satisfaction i have now with my stereo equipment . my equipment has high end sound with a medium high end price . to this day , i have yet to hear a system better sounding than mine ( yes i am biased ! ) . high end does not mean excellent sound because i tried to listen to well known brands and i could not get satisfied with the sound . i believe the key to good sounds are the amplifier specs that only two manufacturers still specify . slew rate and damping factor . one is australian and the other swiss . i have the australian brand to beat . speakers and interconnects are secondary but to me , electrostatic speakers are king ! sacd players that are mid range suffice
