great southern hard melodic rock this band is a great pick-up , especially if you like bands like shinedown or tantric . at times , i wish there was more guitar parts on the album , but its a very solid , safe , and well produced release . nothing ground breaking , but a great listen that will be in my changer for weeks to come
