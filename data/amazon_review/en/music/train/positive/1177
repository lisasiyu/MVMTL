these are the jbs ! if you love all things james brown , then you must buy this collection of funky hits ( tinged with more than a hint of jazz ) he did with his 70 's band , the jbs . believe me , you will not be able to resist the beat ! the excellent horn work of maceo parker and fred wesley are worth the price of the cd alone . the majority of the cuts are r & amp ; b dancing and roller skating classics , especially , & quot ; ( it 's not the express ) it 's the jbs monorail & quot ; , & quot ; gim me some more & quot ; , & quot ; pass the peas & quot ; , & quot ; same beat & quot ; , and & quot ; damn right , i 'm somebody & quot ; . & quot ; think & quot ; , with vocals by lyn collins , is just too funky for words . do n't pass this one by
