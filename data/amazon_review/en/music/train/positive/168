breathtaking simplicity ... like all of antony 's music , this ep has a chilling and superhuman quality to it . unlike his other stuff , the production is toned down on the non-album tracks ( `` the lake '' and `` the horror is gone '' ) to a stark , white-faced beauty that for me defines the core of antony & the johnsons . the album track , `` fistful of love '' , is one of my favourite antony songs , a soulful and grooving lament that makes a convincing argument for masochism as an uplifting and redemptive fetish . though the price is a bit steep , this is a great addition to any antony fan 's library
