finally available ! i 'm so thrilled to discover this recording is out on cd as i 've worn out my cassette . brilliant playing , group interaction ... the sense of urgency in this performance as bill neared the end of his life his heart-rending . i never write reviews but this is one of my favorite albums of all time
