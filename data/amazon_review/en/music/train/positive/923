a great classic chris de burgh album after listening to & quot ; into the light & quot ; and & quot ; flying colours & quot ; , i began a search for more music by chris de burgh . although the music differs somewhat in sound from his newer albums , from the moment i heard hold on i knew i would enjoy this album . my favorite is probably windy night . but all of them are good respectively . i must say i found it interesting how he was able to blend alittle of each song on the album onto the lyrics of the end song , goodnight . i also ca n't help but wonder if a lyric from satin green shutters did n't inspire a later song of his , forevermore . whatever the case this is a wonderful piece for any true cdb fa
