shake your booty ... ... . i noticed this cd because of the name of the band and the suggestions from other amazon customers . i must say it is one of my favorite cd 's ! the songs have great rythmn and the energy of the artists translate beautifully even though i do n't speak spanish or japanese ( one of my favorite songs ! ) everyone-aged from 17 to 83 that has heard this cd , will request me to play it when they visit . pepe 's voice reminds me so much of ricky ricardo , that i 'm surprised the album is n't called `` latenight lucy '' ! ! ca n't wait for the release of their next cd .
