listen to the samples to get an idea if your'e unfamiliar bow wow wow is not a household name , they charted once in the usa with `` i want candy '' ( top 50 ) , and released only 3 proper albums ... their sound is tribal , the lead singer annabella often yelps to percussive drumming and throbbing bass , the mixture yields many great tunes , but it can take getting used to , as it did for me , i was not a fan untill much listening ... if you do n't know a lot of the group 's songs , i suggest listening to as many 30 second samples as possible to get a feeling of whether this stuff is digestible ... most of the songs here are first-rate , i particularly love `` tv savage '' , `` golly golly go buddy ! '' and `` louis qatorze '' , along with annabella 's solo turn `` fever '' ... .if you want to explore further , i suggest the cd `` girl bites dog : your compact disc pet '' to round out your collection , it includes more gems , such as `` sexy effiel tower '' ( where 14 year-old annabella pants orgasmically ... and more authentically than donna summer ) and `` radio g string '' , as well as 3 cuts from this cd in different versions ; but begin here , and do n't go further unless you adore this cd ... .
