excellent performance practice , complete recording this recording of messiah is an attempt at using period instruments ( either authentic or replicas from the baroque period ) and performing it in the correct manner of `` baroque performance '' ( at least as best as we can know ) . clearly there are many difficulties in trying to accurately pull this off , but the result does seem to be very baroque . reviewers have two main objections , which the prospective listener should keep in mind . many messiah fans are used to `` un-baroque '' performances of messiah -- a 100+ member chorus singing with a full tone , a large orchestra , large dynamic contrasts , and slower tempos . when people accustomed to such performances hear hogwood 's recording , it is often labeled as `` dry , '' `` unemotional , '' or `` light . '' other reviewers object to the quality of the performance itself . i think that the soloists could do a better job . the bass is strong , but he could be better , and i think there should be more ornamentation overall . i personally like the sound of boys singing instead of adult women in the choir , but others may differ . other baroque recordings such as gardiner , mcgegan , or harnoncourt are also good period recordings . if you want more traditional interpretations , take a look at thomas beecham 's or robert shaw 's recordings . if you 're looking for a complete , scholarly interpretation , however , i think this is a great recording . oh , and the accompanying booklet is great , too -- very thorough .
