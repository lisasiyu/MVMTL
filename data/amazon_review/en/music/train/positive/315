one of elton and bernie 's best : a complete quality album `` honky chateau '' is an example of why greatest hits albums just do not work for great artists . this early elton john effort is an example of when john and taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence . the whole album seems interconnected with excellent music , vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations . `` rocket man '' was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity . `` honky cat '' starts with a smart jazzy sound with elton in a cocky voice talking about his `` redneck ways '' that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song `` mellow '' , which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice `` you make me mellow , oh you make me mellow '' and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about . i like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in `` i think i am going to kill myself '' is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of `` get a little headline news , i 'd like to see what the papers say , on the state of teenage blues '' , particularly when elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category . salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with `` i have to say my friends , this road goes a long , long way '' with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics . `` amy '' is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice `` amy i may not be james dean , amy i may not be nineteen , and i may still be in romper boots and jeans , but amy you 're the girl that wrecks my dreams '' . one of the ultimate classics is `` mona lisa '' an up lifting song about a tough life in ny city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people , the poor and the affluent as elton mournfully sings `` until you 've seen this trash can dream come true , you stand at the edge while people run you through , and i thank the lord there 's people out there like you , i thank the lord there 's people out there like you '' that in the end is uplifting , that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place . finishing with a flourish , `` hercules '' is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman , a `` cat named hercules '' . the song has john with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys ' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat , it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor . `` rocket man '' is the classic song that elton used to sing for 20 minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best john/taupin collaboration . the additional alternate version of the western sounding `` slave '' is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core 10 songs are just wonderful and always memorable .
