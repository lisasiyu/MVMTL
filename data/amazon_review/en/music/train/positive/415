it 's old school , but still fresh to the death not only was this de la soul 's debut , it 's also a landmark , classic album ... .de la carved out their own unique path in music and created a gem of an album on 3 feet high and rising ... .they presented an almost alternative form of hip hop ... one where it was cool to let loose and poke fun at yourself instead of bragging how dope you are ... .as a result , they were unfairly labled `` hippie 's '' ... . the music on here is top notch ... prince paul , the groups main producer for their first 3 albums , delivers the goods at a time when sampling laws were much , much more relaxed ... .they do an amazing job of sampling steely dan on `` eye know '' ... .some of my other favorites include 'potholes in my lawn , me , myself and i , and the funky collab w/ the native tongue crew ( a tribe called quest ( actually just q-tip ) , and the jungle brothers ) `` buddy '' ... . i highly recommend this album for anyone ...
