mushroomhead is by far my favorite band of all-time i first saw this album in the store and i had never heard of this band before and i thought they looked awesome on the front cover so i took a chance and bought the cd . when i got it home and listened to it for the first time i immediately fell in love with the songs solitaire unraveling , these filthy hands , never let it go , the wrist , the new cult king , and too much nothing . i love how they make 8 band members work so uniquely and the two vocalists just put a whole other aspect to their music and separates them from many other bands . i saw the solitaire unraveling video on headbangers ball and i think it is so awesome and shows just how much emotion there is in their music . i would recommend this album to anybody who wants to listen to and a unique and talented band
