you want to know the truth in life ... ... do n't pass tower of power by . this band is smokin . ' they have it all , great vocals , great compositions , great horns and arrangements . i would have loved to see man from the past on this one , but overall a very solid collection . so very hard to go is top notch material - one of my all time favorites and they have so many great tunes - below us all the city lights , down to the nightclub , what is hip , this times it 's real , only so much oil . easily one of the best bands from the 70 's . got to have this one
