this cd truly made a revolution in my world ! this is the first t.m.r . cd i ever bought and it truly made me into a fan . it 's got great upbeat songs like abort//clear and out of orbit and classics like invoke ( gundam seed ) and heart of sword ( rurouni kenshin ) . he has a truly unique voice and can really touch your soul . ( even if you ca n't understand what he 's saying , it 's cool . go look for translations then ! ) anyway , i reccomend this cd to any jpop or jrock fan . he truly is a great artist that i think you 'll enjoy time and time again . 5stars baby 5 stars ! holla
