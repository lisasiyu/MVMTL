sub-par this release is a great one . however it does not compare with the original `` dear diary , my teenage angst has a bodycount '' it seem almost all of the tracks are filler tracks and the entire album must have been spit out at the last minute . that being said the band from first to last is still very talented both musicaly and lyricly .
