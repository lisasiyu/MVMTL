a nice ( mainly ) trad album ! a nice later album from this all-star , all-gal trad band . on this album , the ladies bring in various members of their families to perform alongside the ensemble ... the longs , maddens , clancys , et al. , pitch in , and show where the group 's trad roots come from . other than a horrendous version of dan fogelberg 's '70s aor neolith , & quot ; the leader of the band , & quot ; this is a great album . ( i & quot ; get & quot ; the thematic tie between the lyrics and this album ; i just ca n't stand the song and think it 's really cheesy . ) otherwise , this disc has an admirable mix of instrumentals and ballads , and joannie madden 's piping is , as ever , a heavenly aural treat . recommended
