fury from 1999 there are often times where we see artists sampling great songs from others , and that has been considered a good or a bad move . recently , the red hot chili peppers sampled tom petty & the heartbreakers mary jane 's last dance for their funky track , dani california . nevertheless , to spin a song of your own , and sample it into another song for an artists own self is considered even more ironic . that is the case for prince , and his latest single , fury , the third single from his album 3121 . the song samples the opening hook from his 80 's track 1999 , and takes it into something else . the song actually is good , and delivers a unique feeling of funk , soul & pop . it is a really good track , that still shows that prince has n't lost his edge . i found this to be surprisingly upbeat and worth its price . this is a great song , and i hope it gets a lot of good airplay . song :
