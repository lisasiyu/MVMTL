a must-have for beatles collectors of the three beatles anthology volumes , this first one is easily the most exciting for beatles fans and collectors . the idea here is to give a new spin to the old classics , and present alternate takes , working versions , live renditions , all of which are being released here for the first time . this volume takes fans back to the very beginning , to 1958 's `` that 'll be the day . '' what a thrill . then we hear home demos that were recorded in paul 's garage . this is followed by the material recorded in hamburg with tony sheridan . we are treated to five selections from the beatles ' decca audition . even if it was n't the greatest tape the beatles could 've made , i 'm sure decca is stil kicking themselves now for not signing the beatles ! it gets better and better as time goes by . the beatles sang `` i 'll get you '' at the london palladium in 1963 , and `` all my loving '' on ed sullivan in 1964 . both of those recordings are presented here . other highlights include : *one after 909 - i actually prefer this version to the one that got released in 1970 . *eight days a week - the tight harmony at the beginning works well . also the false starts were interesting . *how do you do it - the unreleased single . *free as a bird - a new beatles masterpiece . die-hard beatles fans will not be disappointed with this set !
