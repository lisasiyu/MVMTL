uplifting summer love song i first heard this song last summer while i was painting our house . out in the fresh air and the sun ( and recently wed ) , this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen . while it 's what i guess i would call somewhat of a `` rock '' song ( during the chorus ) , it 's alex band 's vocals that conveys the longing , passionate love element of the song . he manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song . i 've also heard chad 's version from the album ; while chad 's vocals are actually not *that* much different from alex 's ( both manage to be very masculine and strong ) , i feel that the version with chad is a `` good '' song while alex 's delivery makes it a `` great '' song . while chad 's voice is great for other songs , for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding . from a woman 's perspective , alex 's way would manage to convince me to `` get together '' while chad 's would scare me off ! sometimes , one vocalist is just `` meant '' to sing a song and either make it or break it . think of `` smooth '' from 1999 . rob thomas ' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was . in this case , alex is the perfect man for the job .
