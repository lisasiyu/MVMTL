mr. mrs. smith when this cd came out , i ordered it immediately , without watching the movie first . since i live in holland and the movie was n't out here yet . i 'm a huge fan of john powell 's scores and i 'm glad ( again ) i bought this score . the score sounds a little bit like 'the italian job ' with a spanish flavour to it , because of the percussion and the accoustic guitars . although the tracks are new and refreshing , i found out that small pieces of music in the film are not on the cd . like : the 'house fight ' part with al the percussion instruments . it 's on the cd ( 'kiss and make up - i believe ) , and it 's a brilliant piece of percussion , but it 's not the same as in the movie ( that sounded better to me ) . second : the cd is a little on the short side . the total play length of the soundtrack is only 44 minutes . a lot of tracks ( 20 ) all relatively short , but ... different . so you 'll get a lot of different tracks swinged at your ears without to much repeating melody 's . something to get used to after listening to the more monotone bourne identity soundtrack . nevertheless a brilliant soundtrack , a must have for the john powell score fans !
