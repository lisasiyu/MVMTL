why ? ? ? i do n't know why this is the only later `` slave '' album released on cd . besides their first album , the others are missing in action . i guess rhino felt that this was their most popular . but slave had alot of `` sleeper '' cuts that the world should hear . i hope that they will eventually see the light of day . this band was unstoppable , and they put out some of the best music in the 80 's along with one way , bar-kays , con-funk-shun , and cameo . this album is [ ] good ! !
