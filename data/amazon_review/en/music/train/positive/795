what a marvelous album ! ! ! deitrick my brother you 've done it again one thing i love about deitrick , besides being annointed and a great singer , is that he stick with the themes of his albums names whether it be crossroads , or lost and found every song reflects what a person maybe going through in those stages . nonetheless , crossroads is a classic gospel album from start to finish . it should have gone a trillion times platinum , but hey he will get his recognition in due time . amen to that . ok , 7 days is mainly a celebration ablum , after all god did create everything in 7 days and that is something to celebrate about , with hot and funky beats that will have you dancing all over the place . do n't get me wrong the album does have traditional church songs and content but its a bit more funkier . just imagine `` god is good '' mixed with `` unity '' mixed with `` god did n't give up on me '' through a whole album . this is the best way to explain it . deitrick my friend , you are my favorite gospel artist and truely annointed . i thank god for you everyday , amen to that . thank you deitrick for obeying the lords will to make wonderful music and most of all i thank god for creating you to make this wonderful music . all glory is yours jesus ! amen and amen . go and get it !
