for those smart enough not to buy american graffiti ost this compilation has nearly all the tracks from american graffiti 's soundtrack , and so much more . this is exactly what i 've been looking to fit my eclectic taste . all the hits are here , this side of great balls of fire and willie and the hand jive . those two would have made this compilation perfect , but perfection is hard to come by when dealing with era compilations . i was n't around back when these songs were blasting on the radio , but i grew up listening to this music - thanks , mom ! if you want to experience the sound of this era , this three-set cd collection is perfect . i 've been looking for maybellene , be-bop-a-lula , peggy sue , sea cruise and blue suede shoes and they 're all here on the same set ! try ebay before you buy here . i found this set relatively cheap over there . there were about five sellers when i bought mine , all vying for the lowest price . this is great road music for those of you in my generation brave enough to try something new and break away from the death cab for cutie/outkast conformity we hear all the time on mainstream radio . for those of you who grew up on this stuff , please let me reintroduce you to your old friends . this cd has almost all of them .
