not really a review as much as a ... . i was asked once what my favorite pavement songs were ... there are some pavement songs which fit certain moods *perfectly* , and at those times , i do n't have a choice but to count them as my favorites . for instance ... i was in new york a few springs ago , spending the evening with the girl i 'd had a brief-yet-effective romance with the summer before . she was there with a guy ; i was there with two other girls , mutual friends . the five of us were in an underground , literal-hole-in-the-wall-type bar , tucked away inside a subway station at 50th street ( i think ) . the bar was called siberia , and was a total punk/russian ( prussian ? ) paradise . every light bulb was red , and there was writing on every inch of the walls and tables . the lone bathroom stall had a gaping three foot hole busted out of the wall on one side , through which you could see only blackness . the sofas had long ago collapsed on their stumpy legs and fallen to the sticky floor , where they laid dejected and off-balance . cushions were missing and the beer was extremely expensive . i got drunk and watched her ... got drunk on the beer and the nostalgia both , pressed myself into a musty corner of the couch , and after a while , closed my eyes . there was a jukebox . it was the brightest and biggest thing in the whole place . it had & quot ; crooked rain , crooked rain & quot ; in it . i played & quot ; fillmore jive , & quot ; wallowed in its brilliant decadence ... i played it again then got up and roamed around manhattan for 5 hours . alone and happy . that night , & quot ; fillmore jive & quot ; was my favorite pavement song
