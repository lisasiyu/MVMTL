awesome collection of a variety of bossa nova ! this is a very good collection i stumbled across and has the original ( and pretty much best ) versions of all the hits - and i disagree with the last reviewer who cited & quot ; chega de saudade & quot ; as being bad without the lyrics - it 's one of my favorites and is such a perfect tune that it needs no lyrics ! get this album if you are even slightly interested in bossa nova - it has quickly become one of my staples..
