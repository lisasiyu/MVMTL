track 14 / worth the price of the cd i agree with other reviewers here -- much of the music on the cd is simply supplemental to the film , is forgetable , nothing really stands out , there is a lack of melody . only one track ( # 14 ) `` my name is lincoln '' -- stands apart , offering a theme , melody , choir and resolution -- it is a signature bit of composing that , for me , is really worth the price of the cd
