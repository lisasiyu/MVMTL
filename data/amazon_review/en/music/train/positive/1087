really a 4.5 ... very solid release that lacks the radio friendly songs that made cracker soul & amp ; kerosene hat college favorites . overall i found the guitar work to be great , same good lyrics and much better vocals from lowery . a more creative effort than gentleman 's blues with less screaming . i do n't know if i agree that this disc has shades of camper van beethoven but this release does remind me more of their first effort cracker soul
