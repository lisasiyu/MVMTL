lotsa goodies in this stocking well , somehow i picked up the rev 's first-ever christmas album even before the two brians ' 2005 holiday discs ( the sainted wilson and the slick setzer , that is ) . as santa said of rudolph 's first jump at the reindeer games in that classic rankin-bass `` rudolph '' special , not bad ! not baaaad ! there are a lot of cool and interesting goodies in this christmas stocking , enough to please most of the whos at your local whoville . the disc has a chunk of chuck berry , and not just the album-closing `` run rudolph run '' ( with the rev , aka guitarist jim heath , trading instruments with his bassist , jimbo wallace ) . it actually starts with track 1 , the full-tilt boogie-woogie version of `` frosty the snowman . '' the credits do n't list the pianist , but `` winter wonderland '' also has a lot of that berry/johnnie johnson interplay , straight out of `` you never can tell . '' there 's also a bit of blazing berry/johnson boogie-woogie sharing space in the unlikeliest of places : alongside a mad-mod-surf `` batman '' swirl on `` santa claus is coming to town . '' other yummy flavors in the rev 's holiday petit fours assortment include a slap-bass rockabilly hoedown instrumental of `` jingle bells , '' a ray charles-type gospel-meets-country-ballad version of `` silver bells , '' a snarky , dirty , bottom-heavy , finger-popping rockabilly swing through `` rudolph , '' a hoedown of `` santa on the roof , '' and an instrumental of `` what child is this '' that tosses around country , surf , spaghetti western , even a little bit of traffic and hendrix . that 's to go along with faithful versions of elvis ' `` santa bring my baby back '' and buck owens ' `` santa looked a lot like daddy . '' the only soft spot is heath 's voice . the rev 's rasp is well suited for his patented rockaswingapunkabilly raveups , but certainly not smooth enough for the likes of `` silver bells '' and `` pretty paper , '' or even `` santa bring my baby back . '' but hey -- you know what ? this album is such a high-spirited affair , and the rev , jimbo and scott churilla , the drummer , have been such good boys this year , that santa can overlook that shortcoming . they should find a little something extra under their trees for spreading such cheer
