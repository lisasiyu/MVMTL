german composer richard wagner would be pleased ! i was around 16 or 17 when this record was released , and it was another masterpiece by the kings of metal ! this release , like the three before it , is part of the foundation of manowar 's kingdom . this is one of my favorite cd 's of all time . it has some of the heaviest moments in manowar history , it 's raw , stripped down , and heavy . this is what true heavy metal is all about . if i were going to give somebody a few cd 's to give them an idea of what manowar is really about , it would be the first 4 cd 's , because they truly are a great period for the band . during that time period , information about manowar was hard to come by here in the united states ; the media ignored them , and the critics panned them , and neither had a just cause for doing so - manowar 's musical abilities far outweighed any of the bands that were getting coverage . joey demaio is still the most original bassist around , eric adams ' voice is simply unbelievable ( i 've studied voice for the last 6 years - trust me , the guy is incredible ) . scott columbus is simply my favorite drummer . i began playing drums well over 20 years ago , and john bonham was quickly replaced by scott columbus ; and we finally come to ross the boss - there is not another guitarist around who has the style that ross has . the first 4 releases were recorded in analog - that 's why the releases that came out after this had a much different sound , the band began utilizing digital recording equipment for the following releases . for me , this cd was the end of an era , because manowar 's sound changed and became a bit more polished and less raw , and it was n't until they released triumph of steel that they regained a lot of the rawness that the digital recording medium of the late 80 's seemed to kill . that said , i would highly recommend this cd to anyone wanting to get a taste of what manowar was really about .
