incredible ... worthy of more than 5 stars wow ... what a great collection of songs , a wonderful album . i am a fan of the church , but even if you have never heard of them , you will find this disc amazing . i am at a loss of words to decribe the songs . my only regret is that there is not a dvd of performances of these songs . i would go upstairs and watch it all night
