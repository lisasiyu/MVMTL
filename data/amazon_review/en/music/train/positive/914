good but not great the music set to midsummer night 's dream arranged here by boswell yields good things but is not entirely great . for instance , since the movie had the story set in tuscany , italy , there are a lot of songs of the opera , since opera was founded in italy and it makes one feel more at home with the movie location . also , intermezzo from cavalleria rusticana , an opera intermission music by mascagni , is heard here . i think these things are all out of place . there should be more emphasis on the music of shakespeare 's time- oboe , flute and renaissance instruments . the soundtrack to & quot ; much ado about nothing & quot ; is even better since it does manage to remain shakespearian . but otherwise this music is beautiful , especially the midsummer night 's dream music by mendelsshon -the overture is a delightful , sunny piece to hear and then there is the famous signature wedding march . i recommend anyone to get the entire classical work- the scherzo is just as good and other selections . this cd is good but not great . in opera , it has featured its brightest stars- fleming , domingo and bartoli . but a great cd nonetheless
