extremely beautiful music first of all , i am not a classical critic , and second of all , i have heard a lot of music in my time and this set takes the cake for the best of class . this music of samuel barber preformed by the new choir of oxford college exemplifies the title of this cd , having not purchased the cd and just listening to the sample tracks available , i am sure i have not experienced it all . but , i urge you to buy this cd and to listen to it in it 's fullest extent
