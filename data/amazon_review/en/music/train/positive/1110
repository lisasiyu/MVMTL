the anime sound track that never was this is a complete concept album centred around anime and punk classics ... the cd has 13 tracks and clocks in at about 30 minutes this shocked me at first when i put the cd into my pc yet then i realised throughout every minute of the cd it manages to sound fresh no matter how many times you manage to listien to it , this is where the cd 's charm lies in it 's bubble gum pop punk rock . it 's fun , it 's lighthearted it 's not serious yet it loves every minute of it ^_^ if you like anime of manga then the packaging will catch you eye immediatly , which is also nice they included the dvd with it so you can see the videos which show off the band 's true vision . if you want some light hearted bubble gum pop punk , or something completly differnt , then you found it . who thought you could cover the sailor moon theme , sing about captian crunch and cover a punk classic on one album ?
