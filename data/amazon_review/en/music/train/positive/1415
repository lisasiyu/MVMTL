keith sweat- keep it comin ' ( 1991 , elektra ) keith sweat made this lesser-known , underrated album with some of r & amp ; bs most beautiful songs like & quot ; why me , baby ? & quot ; , & quot ; i wan na love you down & quot ; , & quot ; there you go & quot ; , & quot ; give me what i want & quot ; , & quot ; the 10 commandments of love & quot ; & amp ; even the & quot ; keep it comin & quot ; remix . the first side of this tape is filled with fast songs & amp ; one love song . the fast songs are terrible . at the same time , this album is better than & quot ; i 'll give all my love to you & quot ; . keith did n't get as good as his first album until his fifth album
