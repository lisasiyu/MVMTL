this is a really good cd i liked the other brmc albums a lot as well , but i think those had that quality where they were initially catchy and you loved it and thought it was the greatest thing ever , but after a few listens it got kinda tired ... still good , but you 'd think `` oh yeah ... '' howl is the opposite . it was ok the first time i listened to it , and i kinda liked it , but it didnt really dig it 's claws into me . for that reason it did n't get pulled out of the cd wallet all that often . then i put it in one day and thought `` ya know , this is actually pretty good . '' then i started listening to it some more and thought `` man , this is really , really good ! '' guess what ? now i love it ... this is definitely a creeper cd , as in - it creeps up on you ( yeah , that was a stoner analogy . ) i think `` weight of the world '' is the best song on the cd , but `` howl '' had really grown on me too - but i do n't want to harp on the songs too much , this is an album as a whole . bands grow up and change , and i 'm glad to see that brmc has done it , and done it well . they have n't lost their muse or gotten `` softer '' just to try something different -- they 've grown and changed and their music shows it . i remember my freshman year in college when achtung baby came out and there were people saying stuff like `` boycott u2 cuz they 're sellouts ! '' - not realizing that ab would be looked at as probably the most insightful , clever , and musically interesting album of their catalog . that 's what the backlash to howl reminds me of -- shortsighted and not entirely accurate . yeah , people may fear change , and admittedly , some artists try it and look like complete idiots in the process ( chris gaines , anyone ... ) but brmc has actually grown , and if you liked their first 2 cd 's i 'd say give this one a shot . it 's really good - and i 'm proud of 'em for making it .
