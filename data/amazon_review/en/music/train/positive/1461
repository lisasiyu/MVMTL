a well fed feast from alanis audio disc breakdown : 1 . fear of bliss - some trippy rock from alanis ! this track does n't follow alanis ' standard songwriting formula and is a bit scattered . nonetheless , a great song . 4/5 2 . bent for you - excellent alt/rock effort . this is the song that opens the dvd portion of `` feast on scraps '' . excellent . 5/5 3 . sorry to myself - this is a spine tingling ballad . perhaps , dare i say , alanis ' best ballad . this song definitely should have been released as a single . 5/5 4 . sister blister - this one 's a monster rocker ! as well as the previous track , this would have been so successful as a single . not since `` you oughta know '' has alanis produced such a great rock track . would have been a huge hit on the modern rock charts . 5/5 5 . offer - another ballad here , however , this one falls incredibly short . while alanis ' voice is good , nothing seems to come together and the lyrics and music are to say the least , boring . 2/5 6 . unprodigal daughter - another great rock track . it 's about alanis leaving home for l.a. to start her new life . we see a hint of the `` angry '' alanis we say on `` jagged little pill '' , maybe because this song is referring back to that time . 5/5 7 . simple together - i believe this song was the song sent to radio stations to promote `` feast on scraps '' . it most definitely was a poor choice . while it is an ok ballad , it 's somewhat dull . 3/5 8 . purgatorying - this song is magical ! it 's a very enjoyable and definitely interesting song . there 's almost an otherworldly feel to this . from watching this song being performed on the dvd of `` feast on scraps '' , it 's easy to see the magic of this track comes from the live performance . nonetheless , great ! 4/5 9 . hands clean ( acoustic ) - it 's really nice to hear this 2002 hit stripped down to the core . sounds great . 4/5 dvd overview : the full concert on this dvd follows alanis though her 2002 `` toward our union mended tour '' most of the footage is from her rotterdam show . it 's loaded with hits , precious rarities and brand new tracks ! alanis has such raw , pure energy in her shows . most notibly on tracks such as `` purgatorying '' , `` you oughta know '' , `` flinch '' , `` sympathetic character '' and `` uninvited '' . this dvd shows us at times the rewarding and struggling process of songwriting in and out of the studio . contains superb behind the scenes footage showing us alanis ' humorous and wacky side . it 's also an excellent facet to understand her and her philosophy to a much greatest extent . 5/5 overall : i actually rate this album 4.2 out of 5 stars . `` feast on scraps '' is a great experience for any lover of live music ! a great buy !
