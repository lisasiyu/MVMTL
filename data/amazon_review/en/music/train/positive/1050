great album , well worth $ 15.00 or more ok , well i have to admit that i am as much a fan of the guitar sounds as i am adam duritz 's voice . i would have rated this as a five star album , yet every once in a while ( on maybe two or the songs total ) adam will get caught up in some moment singing and the dud gets kind of whiny . this guy is one of the best singers on the planet , though and this cd is still one of the best that the counting crows have ever produced . okay , well , the guitar sounds are much more raw , very retro and vintage sounding , i would n't be suprised if every guitar , amp , and effects pedal are 30+ years old . my favorite songs are definitely raining in baltimore ( amazing quiet version ) , long december , have you seen me lately ? , recovering the satelites , and round here . if you like retro music with strong raw vocals you should love this stuff . i 've heard adam 's voice coompared with rob thomas of matchbox 20 . although i would say that they are very unique i admit that for comparison they are simalar in style ( adam 's better though ) . i hope you like the album . enjoy
