a brilliant debut album , from a brilliant singer/songwriter ! do n't let a few bad reviews fool you ! this is easily one of the best albums out there ! there 's not a bad song in the bunch ! and courtney jaye is easily one of best and most original singer/songwriters around also ! and she 's worked with some of the best in the business to create this musical masterpiece ! this is nothing like the average pop music you hear , it has more of a hawaiian sound on some songs , i noticed that the first time i heard it ! she calls it rootsy/exotic/alt/pop on her myspace page ! that 's one of the things i like most about the album ! plus the songs are all so fun , catchy , and dreamy , and she has such a great singing voice , i just ca n't get enough of it ! and there 's something for everyone to like ! i really love all of the songs so much ! but if i had to pick any favorites probably '' time for goodbye '' `` this is the day '' `` love me '' and `` hanalei road '' to name a few ! so please buy this album and listen to the whole thing , with an open mind , and listen more than once ! if you 're anything like me and really like great music that 's different than the usual dull boring music you 're used to hearing , i know you 'll love it as much as i do ! courtney jaye is one very talented artist that has real staying power ! she 's already finished her next album so that 's proof of that ! and from what i 've heard of it , it 's great also ! i know she certainly has a life long fan in me !
