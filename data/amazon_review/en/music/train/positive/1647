one of the classic jazz cd/albums of all time i agree with the previous reviewer , cool jazz ? john lewis and milt jackson defined cool jazz . much better than that crap now that i call `` smoove jazz '' . this cd evokes memories of the music inn and tanglewood in the 50s . the namesake of this cd is the song django , a tribute to the late great django reinhardt . this is a must for any jazz enthusiasts collection
