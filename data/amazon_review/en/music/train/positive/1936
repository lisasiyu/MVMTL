sex , beer and pizza : the only things in life as good as clutch . well , not much to say here . neil ( the bad man with a thousand voices ) and company do exactly what the title says : they unleash pure rock fury . clutch is one of those bands where you ca n't just listen to two or three tunes off the cd ; it demands to be played in its entirety while you and your friends are hopefully partying and freaking out because no band you ever heard in your life jams the way clutch does . a lot different than the classic transnational speedway , but it 's still clutch and every tune is a ten out ten . do n't pass this one up . if you 're new to clutch and want to check one cd out before buying a bunch of them , get tranational speedway league first . after that you 'll grab every other one : trust me . and do n't forget to raise a glass of beer to the live version of spacegrass on here ! necrosoul .
