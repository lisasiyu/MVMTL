great cd ... and a great deal ! leave it to cafe-ta to give its fans such a great deal on not only a wonderful cd , but also on an even greater dvd . this is a must have for all the cafe-ta fanatics ... like myself . the dvd it great but i wish that it wasnt so edited . it seemed like they took a couple of concerts and edited them together ... and sometimes not so discretely . towards the end of the dvd there are some scenes that cuts from them wearing one thing , to another and back again ... all in the same song ! ... but other than that i love it ... ive probably seen it about 50 times and ive had it for about 2 months ! once again.. this is a must have for all cafe-ta fanatics ! ! !
