this cd got me into punk when i looked at this cd on the cd rack , it was only 5 bucks so i bought just for the hell of it . so one day i put in that cd and i was blown away . songs like blackeye , can i borrow some ambition , bath of last resistance , true believers , coming down with me are all great . i love this cd . its worth it to buy it
