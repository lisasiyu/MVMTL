a blissful album of idiot glee yeah its true folks the amazon reviewer was absolutely correct in that the lyrics are simply something to hang the pretty melodies on and the music is nowhere near as sophisticated as blur would later write , but ... and its a big but . blur never again made an album this unabashedly joyful and ecstatic again . mix great melodies , dumb dumb simple but very singable lyrics , lovely vocal harmonies strapped on top of a driving guitar with compelling and dancable rhythms and you have this rolling explosion of brit-pop bliss . sometimes an album does n't have to mean anything to be good
