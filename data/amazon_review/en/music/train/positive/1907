slammin ' cuts str8 outta texas pimp c and bun b came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire . this album slams from start to finish with that old school down south feel . the beats are melodic g-funk , with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs . lyrically and vocally , ugk kills in all departments . they really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows . the track `` feds in town '' is a gangster classic with a phat , funky beat and tight scratches . `` super tight ... '' is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue . the mid 90 's was one of the best periods in rap history , and this album is testament to it . do n't sleep on this classic
