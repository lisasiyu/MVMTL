more classic pac of all of tupac 's post death material , this is probably my favourite album . though some may complain that the songs were not as pac intended , i think they are a fitting tribute to him and for the most part , the updated production is great . most will already have heard the singles `` letter 2 my unborn '' and `` until the end of time '' , both are great , and it is easy to see why they were chosen as singles . other notable tracks are `` this aint livin '' which is probably the best track on here , `` breathin '' , `` everything they owe '' , `` lastonesleft '' , `` m.o.b '' and `` world wide mob figgaz '' . in fact most of the tracks on here are at least good . it goes without saying that this album is not as good as the material pac produced while alive , after all these are his throw away songs . just goes to show what a genius pac was , that these are songs he did n't consider good enough for his albums , they put most other rappers a tracks to shame . i give it 4 stars because there are a few filler tracks and the outlawz are just on here too much . while i have a load of respect for the outlawz for staying true to pac , i just do n't rate their rapping skills too highly . anyway an amazing album , especially considering pac had been dead for 5 years when this was released . r.i.p tupac
