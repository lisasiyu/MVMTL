more ear candy for lovers of america , beach boys , folgelberg , eagles , etc ... larson 's last two efforts ( watercolor sky , sepia ) were both outstanding , polished albums with hank linderman at the helm . this album is more `` raw '' and stripped down in style . more of jeff 's contemporary edge comes through on two part confessional , as if linderman is giving him more production input in the final mixes . `` looking at december '' has more of a solo acoustic singer-songwriter sound than we heard before . `` maybe cascade idaho '' fully has that beach boys/brian wilson sound jeffery foskett brings to the table and as such , more of a foskett than linderman sound . `` a better day '' sounds more like an america song than gerry beckley has done in decades , and since he co-wrote and sang strong backing vocals , it really bears his presence well . `` the way outside '' recalls 1973 eagles/walsh/fogelberg ballads , which linderman has successfully duplicated with his production style . `` play through '' has a aaa radio sound to it , with expressive acoustic guitars and simple tight e.guitar , drums & bass . `` only green '' is a beautiful ballad ( i.e . souveniers ) , and the electic guitar production is remeniscent of bruce gaitsch ( richard marx , timothy schmit ) on some of his solo work . a surprise addition comes after the end , as a short instrumental ensues , no doubt the type of thing that usually winds up on the cutting room floor . all in all a very satisfying group of songs , not a bad one in the lot , which i find amazing in today 's music .
