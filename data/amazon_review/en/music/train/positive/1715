undeniable pop masterpiece _blue_ is simply a masterpiece of pop-rock music ! it has tons of massive hooks , sweet grooves , incredible melodies , awesome vocals courtesy of mr. jenkins , and dashes of experimentalism ! the melodies soar overhead with his sweet falsetto voice , the drums rip and roar through some funky bass grooves , and the guitars strum delicately or spit out a distorted lullaby of happiness . as much as i enjoy third eye blind 's eponymous debut album ( which is one of my favorite pop albums ever ) , i think _blue_ is even better . it is impossible to deny the songsmanship on display here . everyone should listen to this album
