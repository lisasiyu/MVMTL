exquisite i had forgotten over the years just how wonderful this album was , so i was thrilled to find it here at amazon ! granted , it 's not the heavy black vinyl with the faded dog earred cover , but this one fits in my car stereo , makes the commute miles fly by and sounds even better then it did long ago ! thanks
