compulsively listenable i bought this cd without ever having listened to a single note of the band 's work . i had read a review in sound and vision , then the views here at amazon , and i took a chance . i was not disappointed . every song here is an absolute gem . the harmonies are magical , and the instrumentation will transport you . i play this disk again and again , and i think my wife is going to hide the cd if i play it at dinnertime once more . i promise you will not be disappointed . buy this disk , and simply enjoy ; it 's magic , gorgeous , and worth any price
