cube 's 3rd solo is nother good one not his best album , not his worst , the predator seems to fall right in the middle . it came out just one year after his last album and 2 years after his debut ( right after he left n.w.a . ) , so alot of cube albums came out from '90-'93 ( one each year ) . it has 12 songs , and no guests so alot of ice cube gets heard here . it has 1 classic , 2-4 i skip , 3-5 are ok , and the others are good . production is good for iots time buy you can tell it 's defintiely from the early 90 's . dj pooh does 4 songs , muggs does 3 , sir jinx does 2 , and pockets , mr. woody and torcha chamba all do 1 song . every song samples an older song so it 's not the most original of beats but the samples are mostly good . for fans of cube or early 90 's political type gangsta rap pick it up . # 2 - 8 # 4 - 5 # 5 - 8 ( nice beat ) # 6 - 5 # 7 - 10 ( classic -- great relaxing beat sampling the isley 's -- maybe his best song ever ) # 8 - 7 # 10 - 8 # 11 - 6.5 # 12 - 6 # 13 - 8 # 14 - 7 ( has a 1 minute intro before rapping starts ) # 16 - 6 o'shea jackson -- b . 6/15/69 check all my review
