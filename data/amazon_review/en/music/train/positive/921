an eclectic approach satch is full of surprises . thats the very reason he still has such a strong fan following and keeps getting more popular . in this album he made the right decision by brining in nathan east , manu katche and andy fairweather low as his studio musicians . the virtuosity of every musician on this album is astronomical . songs like if , cool no9 , down down down , etc are the satriani you never have heard of before .
