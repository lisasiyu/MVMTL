amps are hot , recording is warm the songs on this album are outstanding , the writing is direct , the themes are the same ones neil has always sung about , making relationships last over time , country living , the road . but the way this album was recorded is probably the main reason i keep coming back . obviously the guitars are all melting and the amps are overdriven and the songs are free-form , but the vocals are right where i want them , and the guitars are so warm that the album never agitates me ( and believe me , i 've listened to some agitating music - teengenerate anyone ? ) . i guess the fifth star is gained by the fact that the songs and the band are still more important than the medium , this album is n't noteworthy for its use of feedback and hot guitars , but because everything fits , in a smooth and soulful way . never gimmick . always authentic . neil transcends the genre again
