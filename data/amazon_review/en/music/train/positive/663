almost perfection..but bogged down by a dying style ... judging by their latest release `` a murder of crows '' , incubus have ditched their funk/nu-metal/progressive/poppish style for a more straight forward rock sound . and for good reason . the moniker genre they were usually placed under has long since died out , and the remaining bands that attempt to release material even remotely close to nu-metal usually replicate the nu-metal bands that came before them . lets face it , nu-metal is dead , and it never really was that great to begin with . incubus was one of the few great bands that incorporated hip hop/funk/metal/jazz and a dj all in one package . `` morning view '' sees the band in their most popular and at the height of their career . now in the lime light , with millions of fans , `` morningview '' does show the band ditching much of their hip-hop/funky roots for more mature production and compostition . the vocals have become the lead instrument with the band taking much of a back seat . that is not to say that `` morninview '' is a less-than-stellar album , on the contrary , it is an album worth owning with much to offer . the musicianship is still amazing and the vocals and lyrics are just as deep and meaningful . `` morninview '' takes time to break into , and even more time to find the hidden gems beyond just being a `` great '' radio friendly album . just like `` make yourself '' i took this album at face value and have missed much of the magic to be found in each song . under a new light one can easily see that `` morninview '' is one of the greatest releases of its time
