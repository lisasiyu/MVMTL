`` wo n't you try ? '' jefferson airplane tried hard , on this 1967 utterly noncommercial followup to their phenomenally successful classic surrealistic pillow . having made rca millions of dollars with pillow , the airplane took full advantage of their newly-minted blank check to create what may be the purest example of musical psychedelia to come out of the sixties . listening to after bathing at baxter 's is literally a trip . bizarrely torqued lyrics are wedded to experimental recording techniques , sound montages , and off-center tempos and rhythms to provide the listener with an auditory hallucination . everything goes , and so it went at baxter 's . it was all new , avant-garde to excess , and it largely failed to reach its fullest potential . most art does fail , but there 's no question that baxter 's cross-pollinated with many other performers and musical styles . the influence of baxter 's can be heard in `` revolution 9 '' by the beatles , and on many other recordings of the era . baxter 's may have sold poorly , but it was heard by the airplane 's contemporaries , and it clearly served as a wellspring of inspiration . an aficionado 's album , after bathing at baxter 's is a ghost in the machine that remains haunting even today .
