a really a good steve vai cd ! i had lost track of steve vai for a while ... .in the early 90 's i bought `` passion and warfare '' ( an instant classic ! ! ) but i did not buy anything after that , cause i just felt so good with passion and warfare that i did n't want to be let down by his next releases . deep inside , i must have thoght that might happen ... well resently i stopped by sony 's website , and i fell in love with the sound clips for this cd . i bought it , and i have been enchanted ever since ! it 's a different cd , but no disapointments . some fans do n't like steve 's singing , but what he sings here is ok . it wo n't hurt . this is a statement , and i ca n't wait to hear part 2 and 3 when they are released
