excellent heavy album devildriver really improved with the release of their dynamic sophomore album `` the fury of our maker 's hand '' . this cd is excellent . the guitar riffs are amazing , and dez fafara is definitely unique with his vocals . the tracks vary in speed , whether it 's the up-tempo of `` hold back the day '' or `` driving down the darkness '' , or the doomy `` sin and sacrifice '' . `` grinf**ked '' is definitely the standout track and a definite anthem . recommended if you like it heavy . p.s . this is n't `` brutal death metal '' . brutal death metal is stuff like devourment , saprogenic , gorgasm , etc . just so that you know .
