an underrated talent . whitley combines dissonant electric guitar with acoustic and his songwriting style is uniquely his own . & quot ; automatic & quot ; is the best thing here , but you ca n't go wrong on any of the others . i prefer this more full-bodied work to his other stripped down acoustic affairs , & quot ; living with the law & quot ; and & quot ; dirt floor & quot ;
