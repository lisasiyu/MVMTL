what an album ... . i listen to a ton of trance artists in the psychadelic/goa esque genre , and i must say that i have yet to hear anything that can even remotely compare to infected mushroom . the originality , detail , and craftsmanship that goes into their music is quite frankly amazing . b.p . empire is one of many amazing infected mushroom albums . generally it is a bit more ambient , and on some tracks possibly a bit more somber than some of their other realeases , but never the less it is a great album . my personal favorite tracks are noise maker and p.g.m.. dancing with kadafi is a track which is more of an experimental track , which appears to be the birth of the second disc from converting vegetarians ( which is an experimental or like im says , & quot ; other side & quot ; to infected mushroom which is like everything else they do , incredible. ) . like all infected mushroom albums , the quality of the production of b.p . empire is among incredible . one of the most amazing aspects of infected mushroom is their ability to cleanly mix a multitude of synth and percussion sounds simultaneously and make the mix sound tight and refined , and not like a huge mess . they are quite an amazing group , and at the time are probably my favorite artist in any genre . i also find it amazing how many people that i have showed infected mushroom to , that do n't even listen to trance , are hooked on infected mushroom . i highly suggest that you pick up their albums if you love trance and have an open mind . i promise you will not regret it
