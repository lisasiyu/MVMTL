canadian gods blue rodeo , out of canada where they are rightfully gods , continues to fly under the us radar ... what a shame , especially when one stacks blue rodeo against lesser talents . `` 5 days in july '' is the gemstone of this richly talented group . combining elements of the eagles , the byrds , poco , the flying burrito brothers , twinges of psychedellic memories , 60 's style chord work *which comes off very nice* and at times , vocal harmonies which bring a sweet hint of the everly brothers , this group , which can rock with the best or slow it down to a nice mellow , has a sound of their own . at once , the lyrics are memorable and catchy . the vocalists , cuddy and keelor , each bring their own qualities which never grow old with cuddy having impressive range while keelor brings at times , a nice raspiness with a clever edge . `` bad timing '' , one of the great tunes off this gem , would soar on the country charts if given a chance . with the exception of `` til i gain control again '' *brilliantly covered earlier by crsytal gayle and later by willie nelson* , all the tunes are penned by cuddy and keelor , as are their efforts on other blue rodeo albums . i had the great pleasure to see/hear this remarkable group at the ramshead tavern in annapolis , maryland . they did not disappoint . if you 're looking for great music outside the usual stuff played endlessly on formatted radio , this is a must ! i would also suggest their dvd , `` burning snowmen '' , which chronicles them over time . if you can , find a way to one of their concerts..
