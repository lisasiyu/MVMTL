kate wears her red shoes and has some fun i think this album is stunning and fantastic ! i have recently been getting into kates music ... first i got hounds of love and was immediatly sucked in i loved it and still do , what an album ! then i got the kick inside which i also immediatly liked but it lacked a little something not sure what that somehting is ? i then got never for ever , wow so diffrent and hypnotic and growed on me so much every time i listened , and then this . abit upset and put off but some other reviews i had set my mind to get this so thats what i did , definately not dissapointed ! so what if its more in the times and a bit over produced and maybe lacking some of the crazness ? ? ? its such a good good album ! still has amazing melodies , craaaaazy lyrics and its fun ( even though some of the subject matter isnt , kate was struggling at the time ) rubberband girl , moments of pleasure , song of solomen , lilly , top of the world and why should i love you are highlights for me but my fave song is the amazing and unbelieveably touching `` and so is love '' as soona s that song had finished for the first time for me i was like '' wow '' ... ..seriously give all of kate a chance , im getting `` the dreaming '' this weekend and i know im in for an amzing challenge , but i also know i will love that too ! the red shoes doesnt deserve bad reviews just because its not people best kate album
