better than just `` 1980s music '' as ballad pop goes , journey is there . these are the songs which were played at proms throughout the 1980s . filled with romance , emotional passion and steve perry 's unrelenting voice , journey 's `` the essential journey '' are a mix of hard , mild and melodic pop rock . occasionally , the band would turn out mediocre music , like `` girl ca n't help it , '' but most is still worth listening to . `` be good to yourself '' sounds like a bad movie soundtrack song , and is not worthy of this otherwise amazing cd . there are two disks , with more music than the average listener is familiar with , and only hardcore fans with know . a few hits are missing , leaving a real best-of cd still out there . journey was a pop band : simple lyrics without a heavy message . distinguishing them was their willingness to step out of the known musical formulas . club music was coming into its own in the 1980s , with djs sampling and mixing . their music does n't sample well , and they risked being a radio-only band . as their hit list grew from `` lovin ' touchin ' squeezin ' '' into a rich repertoire , their concerts became packed into stadiums . those are the songs here . it is 1980s music in every sense of the term , but better than just as music from the period , just like james taylor is better than just being a musician from the 1970s . i fully recommend , `` the essential journey '' by journey . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co
