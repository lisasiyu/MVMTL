a must for any cross country or track runner i heard this cd when i was watching an indoor track meet . one of my dad 's runners showed me the cd and i listened to it . my mom bought it for me back in 1997 as one of the first cds i ever had . it is probably the best classical music cd i have ever owned or to which i have listened . if you run cross country or track this cd is a must as it gets you going gradually , especially the song `` titles . '' a must cd for runners and anyone else who likes nice classical background music .
