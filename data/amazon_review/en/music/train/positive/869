a soul crying out for love , like all souls do ... this is undeniably a tragic yet great album . a friend of mine ca n't play it anymore , because he ca n't stand hearing a soul in torment , which is what the album is . it 's so naked emotionally . spence just bears everything , his very being , his very soul . the only other albums that come close to this is nick drake 's final studio album , pink moon , and lee hazlewood 's emotionally wretching requiem for an almost lady . i wo n't recount spence 's back story , for other reviewers have done it very well . the songs go right to your very being . there is no bs here . this was who spence was at the time , warts and all . it is a testament to another sensitive , young soul destroyed by celebrity , the `` business '' , drugs , etc. , etc.. this was spence 's only real solo album , and it 's a true masterpiece , mysterious , moving , and beautiful .
