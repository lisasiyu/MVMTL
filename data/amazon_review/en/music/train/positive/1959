another excellent album i have downloaded all of black label society 's albums , and even book of shadows and pride & glory , but this was the first album i bought in stores . i am a die hard zakk wylde fanatic , so , naturally , i love this cd . it combines zakk 's heavy riffs , with his soft melodies like the ones from book of shadows , and of course , his ripping solos . i believe that zakk wylde is easily one of the top 3 guitarists of all time . if you are a first time black label listener , however , i would not reccomend this cd . in order to fully appreciate black label society , you need to start off with sonic brew , or stronger than death . some good songs on those cd 's are : bored to tears , lowdown , beneath the tree , 13 years of grief , and love reign down .
