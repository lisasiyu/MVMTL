something different for many people they only think of mary martin or mitzi gaynor in `` south pacific '' so this should be a new and enjoyable experience . i love getting different performers takes on roles that is why i purchase so many different recordings of the same title . this recording sounds remarkable with all the new technology they use to preserve these recordings . it was really great to listen to this because i have heard so much about this limited production so many years ago . i think florence henderson is a natural for nellie forbush , i think she is a very underrated stage performer and singer.so many people tend to just think of ms.henderson as that famous mrs.brady role . one shall be quite surprised . another surprise on this was giorgio tozzi his operetic voice brings such depth and masculinity to his role as emile , it is a perfect match for ms.henderson 's in their duets . the rest of this cast sounds fine and it is one of rodgers and hammerstein 's best scores . i think the best things about this recording is that this availability gives people more avenues to enjoy and explore this classic work
