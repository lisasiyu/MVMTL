founder of wendy 's makes rock'n'roll ! few people are aware that dave thomas , in addition to being the founder and spokesman of the wendy 's hamburger chain , was also the leader of pere ubu . clearly mr. thomas was n't in it for the money , since he made his fortune selling good old-fashioned hamburgers , and so he was free to pursue his own musical muse . the results are sometimes splendid , sometimes things go awry , but it 's always the unique stylings of dave thomas that characterize this raw , passionate music . kinda makes you wonder what would have happened if carl karcher , founder of carl 's junior , had also pursued music with such abandon and freedom from financial considerations
