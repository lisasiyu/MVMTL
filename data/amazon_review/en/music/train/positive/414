tommy 's grandparents pete townshend did n't just invent the rock opera , but also the `` mini opera '' when he wrote `` a quick one while he 's away '' , which pete often referred to in early performances as `` tommy 's parents '' . well , wire and glass could be `` tommy 's grandparents '' because this rich song cycle delves deeply into townshend 's familiar semi-autobiographical world which will be instantly recognizable to any who fan . from the self-confessional `` they made my dreams come true '' which echoes the cincinnati tragedy ( `` people died when i performed '' ) and the isle of wight ( `` and the band played on until the dawn '' ) to the powerful mirror door which revisits tommy and the mirror in so many ways , wire and glass proves that while daltrey 's voice may be fading , pete townshend is still the best songwriter of his or any other generation . to be fair , like any who material , wire and glass works best on the stage , so be sure it see it live if and when you have the chance .
