putting jewel on the map this album is the single reason jewel is what she is today . without this album i feel that jewel would never have been able to establish herself musically , at least not to the point of success she has today . raw , untraditional , brave , naked , these can all descibe her first album . unlike most other hit records this album is a nice departure from the norm . worth a listen
