better than amazon reviews seem to think it is . i 'm reviewing this to raise the avg . star rating . i think this is a decent piece of work that is not intended to be listened to in one sitting . the songs are kinda slow grooves that remind me a lot of traffic at times ; funk keyboards wash over the whole thing and the vocals are almost inaudible whispers . i 'm not sure what place this kind of music holds in the industry , in society , among fellow musicians . i only know that it does n't deserve a three star avg , though it all kind feels like one big song , it 's a real cool , groovy song
