the greatest soundtrack of all time ! this motion picture soundtrack is the best ! that`s my opinion anyway ; the movie ( national treasure - starring : nicolas cage ) has been one of my top favorites ever since it came out . i also recommend the `` titanic '' soundtrack as well if you are interested in this one . and if you have doubts as to whether or not to buy this cd , try listening to the clips . my personal favorite is : `` national treasure suite '' ( track 1 ) . the tracks : `` library of congress '' ( track 4 ) , and `` declaration of independence '' ( track 2 ) are nice slower ones . track : `` spectacle discovery '' ( track 10 ) is another one of my favorites also . some of the tracks on this cd can be a little repetitive , but all in all , i think this cd is worth the money
