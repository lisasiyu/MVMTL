personal and wonderful bob dylan and daniel lanois work better together , it seems to me , then many of the other people dylan has worked with . i certainly like the sound of this record better than the stuff dylan did with tom petty , though i like that stuff too . i actually like this record as much as i like `` blood on the tracks '' and often have both of them in my cd changer at the same time ( which by the way i never set at random play with a bob dylan record , because dylan records were meant to be played in their entirety , the way dylan presented them ) . for me , this record fits nicely between `` tracks '' and `` time out of mind . '' sure he did some great stuff in between , but it 's these personal songs like `` what good am i ? '' that i like so much and , of course , the way bob dylan tells a story . there is nobody better
