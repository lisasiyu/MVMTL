this is ok-vol . 2 is better this cd is just okay . the early jb ballads are the thing here . gives you a good idea of a good chitlin ' circuit performance as typically done for black audiecnes in those days with approrpiate audience response . the standouts here include the extended version of & quot ; lost someone & quot ; which leads into & quot ; please please please. & quot ; even without being able to see the infamous cape routine , it 's quite entertaining . but overall , vol . 2 is better since that cd plays up the more uptempo stuff that put jb on the map
