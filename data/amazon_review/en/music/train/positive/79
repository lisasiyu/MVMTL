nice recap it 's no box set and therefore ( inevitably ) excludes some tunes i would n't have , but this is a good sampler of tom scott 's 70s & quot ; heydays , & quot ; including the crank-it-up & quot ; gotcha & quot ; ( starsky & amp ; hutch tv theme song ) and soulful & quot ; shadows , & quot ; among others . i was disappointed more from & quot ; blow it out & quot ; was n't included , but overall it 's a good ( not great ) single album 's worth of tom scott . if you like 70s fusion ( for lack of a better term ) , you should like this . certainly worth $ ..
