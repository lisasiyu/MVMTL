i like the two together hello , i like armstrong and fitzgerald together . and this is the completed ella fitzgerald and louis armstong together on verve records . the previous reviewers have a few facts wrong . ella and louis did record dream a little dream of me on decca records . you can find this recording on ella fitzgerald : the last decca years . true , grp has released a great deal of ella 's decca output , there are some cuts missing , due from my understanding , some legal complexity . ella did record baby , it 's cold outside with louis jordan . the track is n't included in any of ella 's decca cd outputs , but it was included in the complete louis jordan on decca . but , baby it 's cold outside is n't on any of the 9 cds , it is on the ep that came in the cd box set
