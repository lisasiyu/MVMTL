o-town 's finest ! spice delivers another classic for his fourth effort ( and it 's one of his top 3 albums ) . it has 15 songs , of which 4 are classics , 2 are near classics , 6 are good , 2 are ok , and 1 i skip . guests are few and production is great . produced by blackjack ( 4 songs ) , chase & bosko ( 3 songs each ) , ant banks and payback ( 2 songs each ) . it 's a shame he did n't get no airplay over here on the east coast cause he 'd have definitely gone multi-platinum as he deserves to do . even though i 'm used to southern cali rappers from mc eiht to ice cube to cj mac , spice did it with 1990-sick to put the bay on the map of gangsta rap . the song 1990-sick ( kill ' em all ) featuring mc eiht is a strong & heavy thug'sta song about haulicinations , dirty bay is a hard classic delivered by dr.bomb from da bay , sucka ass nigga featuring g-nut is a hard ice-t like hard hitter , and of course spice has a horrorcore song called snitch killas that sounds like something of the geto boys or ice cube , this is spice 's # 1 album ! freddy chico 's best are *1 ( featuring mc eiht ) , *2 , 3 , 4 ( featuring kokane ) , 5 , 6 , 7 , *8 ( featuring g-nut ) , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , *13 , 14 ( featuring e-40 ) & 15 .
