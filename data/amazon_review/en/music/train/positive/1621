a great place to start prefab sprout , a band that just ages very well . thomas dolby 's footprints are all over this recording . while this cd lacks `` wild horses '' , it contains just about every song any fan could wish for . hands down , it beats the life of surprises compilation with its inclusions of `` lions in my own garden '' and other material from swoon , as well as such gems such as `` the golden calf '' ( a personal favorite of mine ) off from langley park to memphis as well as the wonderful `` bonny '' from steve mcqueen/two wheels good . i think i could listen to this cd for weeks on end and never tire of such greats as `` life of suprises '' , `` the sound of crying '' , `` carnival 2000 '' , `` appetite '' and so many others . yes , you could go buy all the sprout 's stuff ( which i recommend highly ) . still , this is a great way to savor one of the most wonderful bands out there .
