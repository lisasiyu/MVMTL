nothing more to say that has n't already been said , but . . . they 've inducted that macolm mclaren money-making hype `` punk '' band the sex pistols into the rock 'n roll hall of fame ( mclaren 's other great creation was bow wow wow ) who arrived two years after the cbgb thing in new york in '74 ( brit kids seeing the ramones on tour was far more influential on the punk scene there than anything the pistols did ) . those laughable geezers black sabbath have been inducted ( though they had their moments in their early albums ) . even billy joel is an inductee ( thanks to the evil & damned for eternity jann wenner ) ! ! but neither the stooges nor iggy are to be found listed ; their first album came out in 1969 , which would have made them elegible in 1994 ; 12 years of tripe . a lot of people need to get a lot of hate mail for this omission . then again , perhaps not being in the r'nr hall of fame is the last sign of integrity as this genre of music truly dies a slow , ugly , painful death ( see `` alternative '' music since the early '90 's leading to the likes of avril levine or . . . or any other `` serious '' , `` sensitive '' `` hip '' whiney , over-hyped , worthless bands these days ) .
