it is great for a greatest hits album yes , it is missing some good songs from elo ( i would 've like to see all over the world from xanadu on here and rockaria , my favorite elo song , among others ) . but this is a greatest hits album , not a 'all the good songs from elo ' album . this is n't for die hard fans , it 's for casual fans who heard a few songs on the radio and want a greatest hits album to hear some other tunes . the songs on here are great and will probably influence them to buy elo 's other full length albums .
