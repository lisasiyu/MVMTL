a classic , blues or otherwise anyone who dismisses blues music as being sad and depressing and whiny should listen to this album . sure , b.b . king sings about heartbreak and lost love in many of the songs , but he does so in such a way that it is uplifting , maybe just because you can relate to it and say `` oh , that cat knows what i 'm feeling '' . that , right there , is why this record is timeless . all of the songs , with the possible exception of `` help the poor '' , are knockouts . this being a live album of course , the audience is absolutely in love with b.b . and the band , and people often shout out things like `` play it all night ! '' and `` tell it , b.b. ! '' if this were a studio album , it would not be nearly as good . the advantage of hearing blues live is that you get to hear a whole different atmosphere- people screaming , clapping , going wild for the sweet sound of lucille . which reminds me , not only is the guitar on this album fantastic , but also b.b . 's vocals are downright amazing ! they range from a deep gravely tone to a sweet falsetto , and are some of the best blues vocals ever put to tape . if you do not own this , get it , just to hear classics like `` sweet little angel '' , `` worry worry '' , `` how blue can you get '' , and `` you upset me baby '' . an absolute must-have
