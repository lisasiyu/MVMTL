elvin jones kicks ass o.k . folks here we go , from an ex- santa barbara disc jockey to you . the best song on this excellent cd is las vegas tango . what should blow your mind about this song is the multirhythmic backing of elvin jones on drum . the band itself is tight and strong . the song is kinda haunting . i 've hummed it to myself for the past forty years , and after losing the album a while back , i bought a new cd of it through amazon.com from england , and i am very happy i own it . i think everyone should own at least one of this , one for themselves and one to give to a friend . this album , and particularly las vegas tango , is one of the best outputs of any band during the 20th century . buy it
