more than just an excitable boy ... zevon become famous with `` werewolves of london , '' a satirical critique of the world 's womanizers ( past and present ) , but as true zevon fans know , there was much more to this man than `` aaaaaoooo , werewolves of london '' and a three-chord progression that is as infectious as it is cutesy . the true warren zevon was a poet of sorts , a man who tackled difficult subjects ( `` excitable boy , '' for example , with a final verse that still gives me shivers ) , but still remained a sensitive man at heart ( `` accidentally like a martyr , '' for example ; do n't deny , it moves you ) . from the you-know-what hitting the fan in `` lawyers guns and money , '' to the purely delightful recitation of `` i need a truck , '' to the heart-wrenching `` tule 's blues , '' to the rockin ' romp of `` nighttime in the switching yard , '' to the world 's most famous undead thompson-gun toting anti-hero in `` roland the headless thompson gunner , '' excitable boy remains a rock 'n roll classic . in fact , i 'd go so far as to say it 's a staple rock album . it is by far wittier and more creative than most rock albums ever produced ; sure , there are n't too many screaming electric guitars ( oh my god , is that guy playing a piano ? ? ? ) , but excitable boy is quite simply one of the best rock albums ever made . warren zevon was a folk/rock artist like none before him ... and , it 's safe to say , like none we will ever see again
