the jacksons : re-invented , or re-controlled ? in 1975 , joe jackson was tired of motown records controlling his childrens ' careers . so he moved them over to epic records . the newly christened `` jacksons '' had to prove themselves to not only cbs records , but to the world that they could produce , write , and perform their own records with plausible credibility.so instead of being controlled by henry cosby , hal davis , and to a lesser extent , berry gordy at motown , their direction was handed over by epic to philidelphia phunk-meisters kenneth gamble , and leon huff . they had a tremendous string of success , with teddy pendergrass , mfsb , harold melvin , and the blue notes , and mcfadden and whitehead to name just a few . they took the jacksons ' original songs , brought them into the studio , worked their philly majik , and out came one of the greatest soul records ever cut on wax . from start to finish , `` the jacksons '' takes you from one phunkified phunk phest top the next , starting with `` enjoy yourself '' and culminating in the phunkadelic `` style of life '' . when i was a child i heard this record , and originally thought that `` good times '' was the jackson 's remake of the theme from that tv show . but it was pure slow phunk . phunk-da-fied- , phunkalicious , or just just plain phantastic , the jackson 's epic debut is phat
