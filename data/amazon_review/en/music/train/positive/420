lost like alice ( or , four stars for the original album , zero for the add-ons ) am i justified in believing that muscular , meritorious pop music -- the kind we shove our hands toward the volume knob for , the kind that thrills us just to be alive for -- is on the cusp of a major comeback , or do the continuous coronations of [ ... ] we 've witnessed so far this year mean that we 're all sitting shivah for the good stuff and are too stoned on stupidity to recognize it ? the very same signs that appear encouraging from one angle are horrifying from another . look no farther than the terrific anna nalick , one of a sad handful of artists hobbled this spring by befuddling single choices ( let 's just say for now that whoever botched the radio plan for that sterling new dixie chicks record deserves a daily caning in the town square until no fewer than one of those babbling loudmouth heifers *is* ready to make nice ) . her gorgeous debut album , wreck of the day , got off to an okay start last year riding the coattails of first single `` breathe ( 2 a.m. ) , '' so of course those dolts at columbia records went with `` in the rough '' as a follow-up ( why not that magnificent title track ? or `` forever love '' ? or even `` citadel , '' for cryin ' out freakin ' loud ? ! ) , and of course it tanked . but then , just like manna straight from the fingertips of god himself , the geniuses ( geniui ? ) behind tv 's gangbusters smash `` grey 's anatomy '' used `` breathe '' to underscore the heart-pounding climax of their season 's most-watched episode , and nalick was suddenly back in bid-ness . top forty was interested again , and columbia -- ever eager-to-please -- came up with the bright idea of re-releasing nalick 's album with extra tracks , one of them being -- get this , guys -- a newly-recorded version of `` wreck of the day '' that is so balls-out horrendous , you just *know* they 're going to make it the third single . the sorry [ ... ] -- every one of them -- need to be slapped . hard
