buyin ' them outta order ! ! ! i 've just gotten hip to the hotel costes series by stephane pompougnac ( so i 'm 4 years behind with this review -- please , bare with me ! ) ... i 'm one of those people who do n't want to be left outta the loop when it comes to stuff -- at any rate , i started buying this series outta order ... i bought # 5 first , # 4 was too latin for me to purchase , # 1 too expensive , and # 3 was unavailable ... soo , i decided on & quot ; la suite & quot ; because of the unfamiliarity of the songs and artists on it . well , some of them anyway . the ubiquitous & quot ; jazz music & quot ; by de-phazz almost made me not buy this set , but i said , what the hell ? it wo n't be the first time i bought a mix/comp cd with songs i 've already seen or heard a million times already . how does that work anyway ? what ? certain record labels/ mixers all bid on the same songs or something ? ahem ... as usual , i digress . all that notwithstanding , & quot ; la suite & quot ; was an entertaining delight and voyage into chill-house , as i so aptly pen music such as that remixed by pompougnac . this whole series is tempting me to go ahead and buy 1 , 3 and 4 no matter the cost . hey -- i 'm the type of music buyer who likes to own all volumes in a series , what can i say ? anyway , getting back to the review of & quot ; la suite & quot ; , it 's not as good as # 5 ( or from what i could sample on # 1 in borders ) , but it does have some stellar moments with the opening & quot ; to ulrike m. & quot ; by doris days with a zero 7 remix ? ? ok , pompougnac , what gives ? i thought these were supposed to be songs mixed by you ? other stand out tracks are from 45 dip ( check these guys out on the & quot ; acid lounge in space & quot ; comp cd ) , sympatique ( now , this is true parisian music despite it 's & quot ; cheesiness & quot ; as one reviewer stated ) , mo'horizons ( nice , as always ) , palais mascotte ( strong dance floor appeal ) , i : cube ( hypnotic with a 60s feel ) , pascal w/mister day ( nice disco-track ) , mr. scruff ( the song says it all ) , boozoo bajou ( nocturanal ) and streetlife ( cinematic and groovy , baby ) . this is a worthy investment for any chill/house music fan . the songs on costes & quot ; la suite & quot ; are refreshing and upbeat from beginning to end . sure to impress even your most stiff-necked guests at your next get-together -- you know the ones , they stand on the wall all night long with their half empty bottles of corona trying desperately to look cool
