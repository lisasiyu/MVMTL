a hidden gem it seems that many want to place kim richey in a box and she just does n't seem to fit in one . like shawn colvin , she is someone who just has her own category . this is actually my favorite of all the kim richey i own , followed by `` bitter sweet '' and `` rise '' . my favorite song on `` glimmer '' is `` did n't i '' and the title song is great as well . give this one a try and enjoy .
