my favorite jb cd of all time ... by far , picture this , is my favorite cd from the jb collection ... have three copies ... one for the home , one for the car , and another he personally signed for me at one of his concerts ! been a fan of his since he appeared on tv talk show back in late 1997 ... despite our daily hectic schedules , his music always brings us back to a place that is calm , relaxing & peaceful ... now that we have small children , they are even accustomed to listening his music , which makes bedtime even sweeter ! : )
