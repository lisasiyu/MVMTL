endgame two months before billy higgins ' death , the drummer & amp ; charles lloyd say their musical farewells with the tapes rolling ( courtesy lloyd 's partner dorothy darr , who also made a film of proceedings ) . they play sax/drums duets ( lloyd mostly on alto , in fitting homage to ornette coleman , though he also plays excellent traneish tenor on three tracks ) ; they perform exotic woodwind/percussion duets , with lloyd on tibetan oboe or flute ; higgins plays guimbri ( the 3-stringed instrument used in gnawa music ) , sings gently ( & amp ; rather dodgily ) in a variety of languages , even plays a blues on the guitar or does a 1960sish paean to love called & quot ; take a chance & quot ; ; lloyd adds short meditations at the piano . some of these tracks do n't mean much outside the context of this session -- the piano solos get a bit too samey , & amp ; there 's too much voice'n'guitar ( though the blues is rather nice ) . others are superb -- the two long alto/drums duos ( one on each disc ) are great stuff , & amp ; lloyd 's tenor pieces are also superb ( there 's a nice traneish blues on disc 2 ) . the more exotic pieces are often quite ravishing . i suppose that many listeners will for sentimental reasons like having all this stuff , the unalloyed good tracks as well as those that only acquire real significance in the face of higgins ' own personal tragedy . i 'm less sentimental when it comes to what goes on my stereo : i could have wished for a carefully selected single cd of the highlights , which would have been a genuinely outstanding disc . four stars as a compromise rating seems about right . this is n't a disc for the casual listener , but for those willing to bear with a few qualitative dips & amp ; peaks , it 'll prove a rewarding release
