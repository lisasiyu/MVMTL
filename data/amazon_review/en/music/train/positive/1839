sick death-core i 'll make this review short and sweet , because i 'm feeling lazy today . anyways i 've had this cd for about 6 months and whenever i pop it in my mind is blown away , and my brains are thrown in a blender . these guys have two singers , and they both constantly switch off between different vocal styles , the brutal death style , the hardcore style , high pitched screams , and it blends together in a way that you will not be able to comprehend . one thing this band does not do is ever sing like a wussy , no emo garbage here . basically if you think you 're some big tough death-core kid because you listen to premonitions of war , the acacia strain or the red chord , you do n't know nothing until you 've heard this . no disrespect to the latter three bands , they are some of my favorites , and some of the best live ... .but this cd is something else . now come to colorado , despised icon because i wan na see how much chaos you cause live . buy this if you want to hear one of the heaviest bands in existenc
