great , but not the best of i 've been listening to soul coughing religiously for years now and was thrilled when this disc was released ( even though i knew i 'd have almost all the material on it ) . although all the songs here are well worthy of being here , i feel there are some songs missing that need to be here . where are `` fully retractable '' and `` i miss the girl '' , two of the funkiest soul coughing tracks ? i am very pleased , however , that `` unmarked hellicopters '' was put on here despite not being on a precious soul coughing release . all in all this is a great disc , and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a good overwiew of soul coughing 's music . however , i 'm sure other die hard soul coughing fans will agree that there are some great tunes missing from this disc
