enduring christmas favorites this year for our church christmas concert , we are doing a collection of michael w. smith 's christmas music . to my delight , two of the songs - emmanuel and christmas hymn - were ones i fell in love with twenty years ago while listening to this collection on cassette . warm and bright , and still as fresh now as it was in the early 80 's , this is still one of my favorite amy grant albums and one of my favorite christmas albums
