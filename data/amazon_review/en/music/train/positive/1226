great music but poor quality disc i bought this several years ago ( before amazon was around ) , and i love it . i loved the song `` bangkok '' back when it got so much airplay in the 80 's , and it was a pleasure to hear the rest of the musical . however , after spending $ 35 on the 2 disc set , one of the cd 's cracked after a few plays . it was n't my player , or anything like that - it just simply cracked . so one of these days i will replace it , and then i will be sure to make a backup straight off just in case . also , i 've never heard the broadway version , but my husband has listened to both and says the original london cast version is far superior
