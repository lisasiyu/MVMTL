nicks version of tragic kingdom on what 's left of me , nick lachey sings about lost love and heartbreak for they whole duration of the cd . this is his version of no doubt 's tragic kingdom cd . every song is about a broken relationship . the lyrics are very good and the songs are also very well done . do n't buy this cd if you are looking for his soulo upbeat fluff . the tone of this cd is sad . most of the songs are ballads . but not slow ballads more like pop rock power ballads . he has a great voice . it is strong and has a great tone . out of every boy-bander i have ever heard i would say he has the most talent . not only is his voice strong but it is also great because he sounds like a man not a girl , ( i.e . justin timberlake ) . the stand out tracks are : i ca n't hate you anymore , on your own , and beautiful . the rest of the songs are good too . this cd finally makes him a legitimate music star
