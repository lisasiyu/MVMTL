the blac monk funk has arrived on the scene ! i 've been a big fan of three 2 's work as a convict and w/blac monks , but dude def . can put it down on his own . took me forever to finally get a copy of this record , but it was worth the wait . plenty of laid back flow from tre deuce on beats from houston legends john bido & mike dean . if you can ever manage to find this album for a reasonable price , i'de recommend coppin ' it
