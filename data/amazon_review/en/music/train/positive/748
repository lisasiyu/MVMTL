i 'm sure if it were sung in english , i 'd hate it japanese singing is cool to listen to . it is an elegant language that sounds really good in combination with the synthesized pop style.. ( not synth pop mind you , but keyboard drums and all ) . i am sure that if it were done in english , i would look at it the same way i look at britney spears ...
