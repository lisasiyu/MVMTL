buy this version ! ! i owned this ( the movie version ) years ago as a record and loved it . then i got rid of my records and switched to cd 's . after several years i was missing my camelot music . so i bought the broadway cast version with julie andrews & richard burton ( how could i go wrong ? ! ? ) . i was quite disappointed and over the next couple years only listened to camelot , perhaps , once more . finally , i realized that i needed to buy the movie version of camelot with vanessa redgrave and richard harris . wow , i am delighted once again ! ! now i find myself humming the songs and looking forward to hearing camelot again .
