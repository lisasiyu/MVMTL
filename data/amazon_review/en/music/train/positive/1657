a good value , and a great place to start i was only casually aquainted with mary chapin carpenter 's music before picking up this album . the hits i knew were all here , and so was a lot more material i have come to love as well . i was a bit leery that & quot ; down at the twist and shout & quot ; was a live version from the super bowl ; this song was the primary reason i wanted a mcc album , and i was concerned a live version recorded in a stadium during the super bowl might be of inferior recording quality . but i need n't have worried , the sound is great , and the performance is energetic and fun , with a verse in creole thrown in for good measure . & quot ; this shirt & quot ; is probably my favorite track i was unfamiliar with , but the entire album is quality ; there are very few 17-track albums by any artist where i can say i enjoyed every song . i now look forward to exploring her original albums . i highly recommend this album to anyone looking for an introduction to this great artist
