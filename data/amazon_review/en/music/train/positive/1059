harry potter 3 still haunting and mysterious just as the first two , this would have to be my most favorite out of the harry potter installments . each track on this soundtrack gives you a clear idea of how the movie is like in your head , having the same theme of the last two movies , but making it more eerie and more amusing to listen to it . having loud tracks , some tracks are beautiful ; such as track 6 and track 15 . i 'm very happy that most of the tracks are over 2 minutes long , not having to change the track in like a minute and able to enjoy the melodic score . john williams is an excellent composer . i highly recommend this to anyone ! 1 . lumos !
