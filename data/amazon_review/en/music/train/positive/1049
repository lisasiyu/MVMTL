perfect ! now this is very good . a cd set with some of the best post-punk material to come out of liverpool and manchester . there is unfortunately some great overlap with the martin hannett story cd but this set is overall more satisfying since it is more varied and also contains more stuff as well as a few rarities that everybody will appreciate . indeed , in additioon to buzzcocks , the fall and new order , which were obvious choices there are also some old favourites like ludus , crispy ambulance and big in japan that merit to be heard . if you are interested in thie very special period in british music history then this is an essential acquisition .
