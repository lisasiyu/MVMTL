awesome vanity 6 club dance classic of course i remember back when i first heard this song ; i was still in high school ( yes , the 80 's ) , and it was not from the bhc movie either ( i was n't allowed to see it in theaters ) . it was at a local club a few years later . this song has not only a killer beat that anyone can dance to , but killer lyrics , singers , and that it was produced by prince himself - so naturally this song was a winner . still is . it rocks , baby . and i proudly have several copies on cd , cassette and mp3 . a little obsessed perhaps ? ? ? ? not really . but this literate one-hit-wonder was an indeed dance-club classic , similar to eddie murphy 's dance hit class one-hit-wonder `` party all the time '' . i love singing along to this hit song . and the singers are sharp , focused , and are actually very good vocalists . the music flows very smoothly throughout the song , especially the break , where the girl says , `` i do n't like this groove ... .give me something i can croon to ... ..catch my drift ? ? ?
