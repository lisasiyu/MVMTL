his best yet i ca n't rate this one highly enough . it 's certainly in a vein with his last couple , but , as has been oft noted , it 's more political and full of social commentary . some people will like it a little less than the two preceding ones , as a result . i expected to have that reaction , but i found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all , and rodney melds them well with his more personal insights , which ultimately predominate in the end . also , focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun , like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the notorious cherry bombs . by the way , if you like this album , you may want to pick up the book `` rednecks & bluenecks : the politics of country music . '' it 's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and americana . and rodney shows up prominently throughout the book ; there 's a whole section just about this album
