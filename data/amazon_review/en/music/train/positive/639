shhhh . listen miles always let the music do the talking , so my advice is just listen to this album . nevertheless , i will bang on about it a bit , just like the others . this is a cd i put on after i come back from the pub , or club at night when i 've had a few drinks or whatever . somehow it just calls out to me `` luke ... luke ... play me '' and i do . it never fails to move me ( and sometimes physically ) . it is a strange , dark brew of textured piano and electric piano riffs and some minimal rythmical work by williams and holland , with miles gliding over it like only he can and john mclaughlin creating great atmosphere with some wonderful guitar work . it is raw , like most miles davis stuff , but also very smooth and peaceful - with a kind of dark streak running through the middle . quite unlike any music you will hear these days , bar perhaps aphex twin . when i first got this album i thought it was incredible and powerful and was even quite scared of it for a while - it seemed to possess some kind of quiet voodoo power . there is magic in this music , definitely . but , over the years i have listened to it regularly and it continues to give me warm pleasures . every listen becomes a rich , rewarding experience . it is a real grower , and calmer than most of miles ' other fusion work . it is a good companion to `` a tribute to jack johnson '' ( mainly because of the presence of mclaughlin on guitar ) , although this album is far less aggressive , and more gentle and mysterious . the album will take you on a pleasant little journey down a bubbling creek , in the middle of the night ...
