this album is the reason i got into country music from the pop title track , a duet with kid rock protege uncle kracker , to the heartstring tug of there goes my life , this album has great range and thoughtful lyrics which are absent in many other genres . chesney is perfectly positioned to become a crossover star , earning the status more from his music than his pretty boy image . aside from the title track , most songs refreshingly veer from his beachcombing , young jimmy buffet beach anthems that are characteristic of his earlier work
