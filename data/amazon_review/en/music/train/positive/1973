5 stars because it 's lemon , but not the best sound blind lemon jefferson was the greatest of the country bluesmen . ( for a measure of my enthusiasm , see my review of the yazoo set . ) if you dig him enough , or are curious enough , to want his entire output in one place for a budget price , then by all means this is the package to buy . but completeness and price are the top virtues of this set . if you want to hear these records at their best , with careful attention to making them sound clear and present , the yazoo one-disc compilation still leads the pack , far and away . except for a slightly better mastering job , these four discs mirror the four separate blj volumes on document . in fact , i would not be surprised to learn that these _are_ the old document masters , run through a noise reduction system . the sound quality is quite uneven : the better-sounding takes sound pretty good , but some of the others are awful . the version of `` 'lectric chair blues , '' one of lemon 's finest records , as heard here is terribly worn and noisy , to the point of being unintelligible . also true of the same track on the document . on yazoo , it 's a wonderful listen and you can hear and understand all of the words . `` long lonesome blues , '' take 2 , is also nearly inaudible . on the yazoo , it sounds as if they may have been working with the same 78 disc , but the results are much improved . jsp records gained a stellar reputation because its earliest roots-and-jazz compilations were mastered by the late john r. t. davies , who was a genius at resurrecting old recordings and making them sound real . but this is not one of those sets . so : with lemon jefferson , you always get quality music , and with this jsp collection you get nearly all of it . ( several alternate takes are not here . ) but if sound quality is an issue , i have to recommend yazoo 's `` best of .
