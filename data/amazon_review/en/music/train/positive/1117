best offspring album . an inside review . i have been an offspring fan for many years . i have listened to every one of their albums serveral times over and this one has came out on top of all of the rest . in my opinion , the albums from greatest to least are ( not counting their greatest hits album ) : 1 . ignition 2 . self titled 3 . smash 4 . ixnay on the hombre 5 . americana 6 . splinter 7 . conspiracy of one note that i am judging the album as a whole , and not just by the best songs . ignition has not a single `` space filler '' song . it is a raw , 90 's punk rock , consistant album . some disagree that this is the best of the bunch and argue that smash is . i agree smash has amazing songs like `` self-esteem '' , `` come out and play '' , `` gone away '' , and many others that helped boost the offspring to the mainstream . but not every song on smash is absolutely good . `` dirty magic '' is the best song on the cd , if not the best offspring song of all time . i think it is overlooked and underrated . ignition starts off with dexter yelling `` f**k '' and shows you were the album goes from then on . `` session '' is the first song on the cd and one of the top songs of the cd . there are many great and catchy songs from then on . then hits the more emotional , dark , and mysterious song `` dirty magic '' . then it moves into the drug song on the album which is `` hypodermic '' . after that comes the pyromaniac loving song , `` burn it up '' . `` no hero '' is also a great example of how the offsping can turn a simple chug riff into something amazing . `` l.a.p.d . '' is to offsping like `` f**k the police '' is to n.w.a . another catchy song comes after that called `` nothing from something '' . and what better way to end the cd with a great song like `` forever and a day '' . sure this album is no sgt . pepper 's , but no one has touched the beatles . so i highly reccomend this album to people who have heard the offspring before . but if you are just starting to enter the offspring 's world , i would suggest smash for a better feel . after you get ignition and if you really like it , their self titled is right up there with it
