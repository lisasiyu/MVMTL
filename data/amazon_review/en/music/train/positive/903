one of the greatest early british hard rock albums this album deserves to be ( at least ) as popular as led zeppelin 's first two albums or deep purple 's `` in rock '' and `` machinehead '' albums . simply great . and by the way , you should check out ten years after 's `` a space in time '' too . the high point of the album , which includes many fine tracks , is `` come together in the morning '' . and the original version of `` wishing well '' is so much more powerful than the better-known version by gary moore , which just does n't do the song justice . while many reviewers rave about paul kossoff 's guitar work , i think this album is a real showcase for paul rodgers , one of rock music 's greatest singers
