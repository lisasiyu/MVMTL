gregg allman laid back greggs first solo album . cut in capricorn studios with a 19 year old chuck leavell on keys is a superb lp . re workings of `` midnight rider '' and `` please call home '' are instant classics as is `` multi coloured lady '' and greggs gospel arrangement of `` will the circle be unbroken '' . if you love your music heartfelt and blues/roots soaked then this is a must have..
