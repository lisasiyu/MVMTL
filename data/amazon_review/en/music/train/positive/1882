songs that will put adventure in your heart my gal sara and i lived on a sailboat in the caribbean for a long time and we spent most of it at anchor , as we hated marinas . besides , they were expensive . we 're both writers , so on a good day , flat seas , anchored off a deserted island like the five island group in trinidad or ile fourche , halfway between st. martin and st. barts , where it is pitch black on a cloudy night , but oh so gorgeous when the sky is clear , we 'd put these four cds along with banana wind in the cd player 's magazine , put the machine on random play , then read and write the day away with jimmy b playing in the background . there is just something about listening to mr. buffett in the caribbean , florida too , that seems so right . his catchy , lyrical , sailing stories , drinking stories , personal stories never get old . they 're as fresh the hundredth time as they were the first time . this collection is simply outstanding in every way , not a turkey in the bunch , and oh yes , mr. b has sung a few turkeys in his day , but as i said , they are not here . these songs will move you to laughter , maybe a tear or two and they may have you up and dancing a bit , but most of all they well waken a sense of adventure in you . well , they should anyway , unless you 're a died in the wool , tv watching , couch potato . but , you know , chances are that even if you do tube the day away , these songs just might get your heart pounding and your soul wanting a bit of adventure . that 's a good thing . jack priest , sailor home from the se
