when even a metalhead can appreciate ... i typically do n't listen to c & w ; i 'm more of a fan of the groups 'disturbed ' , 'staind ' , 'metallica ' , etc. , but i have to say that this is some of the best country and western i 've heard to date . after listening to the title track 'when it all goes south ' , i went out and bought the cd . it 's laid back , upbeat , and thoroughly enjoyable to listen to
