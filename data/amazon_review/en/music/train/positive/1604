a rocking medley of traditional folk tempest expertly infuses ballads and reels with rock , giving traditional folk music a new energy as well as contributing some original pieces that are equally timeless . i like this album even better than their last ( titled & quot ; balance & quot ; ) . though each track is distinct and stands well on its own , they all complement one another and play almost seamlessly as a whole . maybe i 'm partial since i first heard tempest live as the current ensemble of musicians , but i think newcomer violinist sue draheim 's harmony vocals add a sweet texture the previous album did not have . then again , there 's just something about the female voice in general that gives authenticity to the emotional layer in folk ballads . at any rate , having seen some of tempest 's live performances , i can attest that all of its current members are highly talented and treat the craft of blending folk and rock with a professionalism that is entirely trustworthy . listening to this album is like gathering around a home fire and being entertained by a captivating storyteller . definitely worth hearing ... again and again
