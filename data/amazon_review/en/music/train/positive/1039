dont know whats wrong ive listened to ever possible sinatra era from dorsey days to the final reprise days . his voice never seems to falter like most reviewers claim . it would help if i knew when this cd was recorded , but it really doesnt give any information about the dates of the performances . the whole cd proves why sinatra is one of the greatest entertainers of all time . ive heard ever live cd by sinatra and enjoy all of them . i highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good music . anyone who gives this album less then a four , need to listen to the cd again . excellent sinatra concert !
