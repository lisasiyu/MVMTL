this is pop , i think ! xtc did n't start out with any remote idea of aspiring to the very stifling punk classicism of the day.the only relation 'white music ' has to punk is the simple three chord structures . otherwise tunes like the catchy & quot ; this is pop & quot ; and the offbeat , quircky reggae of & quot ; all along the watchtower & quot ; have more relation to not only early british invasion music but to the more abstract musical experiments of american avante rockers.neither is this in any way typical xtc-in years to come the band would develope a sound much more melodic and sweet ( neither of those terms ever apply to this music ) but the stuttering vocals and andy partirdge 's clever humor are more then enough to carry this album.from a guy whose more interested in funk and fusion normally i find this album worth a listen-'white music ' will definately command your attention.and it 's not too loud either
