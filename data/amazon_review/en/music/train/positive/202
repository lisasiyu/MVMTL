great cd seth maheu `` college student '' ... .your high . remedy is probably the song i like least on this album . i hate it . the rest of the songs are awesome though , my favs are `` because of me '' `` world falls away '' `` tongue '' and `` simplest mistake '' . this cd is a solid effort . and seth , you know ef all about music . the fact u like remedy the best , and suggested that anything by lloyd banks is worth buying shows you have terrible taste . jurrassic 5 are good , but `` amazing lyricism '' ? ? no . jurrasic 5 are good because they are fun , and keep the forumla simple and old school . true hip hop . but there are legions of more talented emcees . dont ever say anything about lloyd banks again . he is terrible and makes outdated , gangster bs . he should get over himself and stop furthering the stereotypes everyone has of hip-hop . hip-hop has a terrible name becuase of losers like him , 50 , ja , and eminem ( yeah he used to be good ) . buy this seether album
