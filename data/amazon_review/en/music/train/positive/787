in the morning of magicians flaming lips have suceeded in creating their own musical world on `` the soft bulletin '' . this cd is easy to find at most stores and often sold at a low price , so there is no real reason why you ca n't go pick it up right now . this record is best heard at 3 am with headphones on . yoshimi was my first lips record , and the main difference between `` soft bulletin '' and `` yoshimi '' is the production values . this recording has a big lo-fi sensibility to it . steven 's drums are always loud , boomy , and usually crackling , like they recorded way too hot . at times the record seems overloaded with sounds , and at first , i thought it would have benifited from the more prestine `` yoshimi '' production values . it has grown on me though . i do n't really understand the point of having `` race for the prize '' and `` waiting for superman '' ( the weakest track on the album ) in two seperate versions . to me the record would have ended perfectly on `` sleeping on the roof '' .
