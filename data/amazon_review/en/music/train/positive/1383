impressive and affordable the debate over the performance of j.s . bach 's cantatas boils down to the following : the evidence suggests that bach only had one singer per part for performances of his cantatas . thus , any historically accurate performance of these works will maintain the one-singer-per-part approach . at the same time , however , there is additional evidence that bach wanted more performers . we are thus stuck with deciding whether bach wrote for the musical forces he had on hand ( which seems logical enough ) or whether he composed for the performers he would like to have ( which would seem silly , if he knew there would not be enough musicians to realize his intentions . on the other hand , bach does make & quot ; solo & quot ; and & quot ; tutti & quot ; distinctions in the score ... draw your own conclusions ) . rifken is a strong supporter of the one-performer-per-part approach , which may seem a little sparse at first . yet , when one listens to the various cantatas on these disks , one must confess that these sound , well , beautiful . this may not be an approach which would work for all of bach 's works , but the effectiveness on these disks certainly lends the interpretation validity . regardless of where you fall -- and if you fall -- in the strenuous debates over historical performance , i would heartily recommend this disk . not only are the performances polished , but the works themselves are exquisite -- a wonderful sampling of bach 's cantatas . ( personally i am addicted to the duet , & quot ; wir eilen mit schwachen , doch emsigen schritten & quot ; from bwv 74 which i could gladly listen to over and over -- listen to it and you will see why .
