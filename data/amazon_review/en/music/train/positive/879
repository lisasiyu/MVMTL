do n't believe the snipes , it 's their best yes , i was once like you . enraptured by xtc 's more lush productions like skylarking . but maturity encouraged me to pay closer attention to go 2 and it has proven to be their finest hour . pure , raw , creative energy captured on tape . this is what andy and colin are capable of when not distracted by their more beatlesque leanings . there are lots of good tunes on the later albums , of course . drums and wires and english settlement are personal favorites . but xtc never exploded with this level of combustion again
