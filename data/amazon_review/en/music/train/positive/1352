so hot it 's cool i noticed that all the reviews are pretty short , so i 'll try and keep mine short , as well . i bought this album around seven or eight years ago when i was a bachelor and living in a 600 square foot backhouse . because my personal dwelling space was so small , i wanted to create an illusion that my place was big , spacious and open and i did that not only through carefully choosing my furniture and accessories , but by creating a `` big atmosphere '' through the music i chose to play when i had guests over . whenever i played this cd at dinner parties i threw , people literally stopped and noticed the music . i had a few people snicker and say that the music was silly and outdated , but for the most part , people really seemed to enjoy it and paid less attention to the obvious fact that everyone was crammed in my little place like sardines in a can . what i 'm suggesting is that this music has a lot of heart , a lot of soul , a lot of punch for the buck . if you find yourself listening to the same old music , you might just want to pick up this cd and expose yourself to something so cool , it 's hot
