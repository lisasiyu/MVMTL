definitely creative ministry ! ** this cd is really my favorite , even above the fred and mary mary . also even above the mass choirs , this cd is my favorite because of its closeness and realness to me . not only does canton jones get you crunk , but you can realy feel the lyrics because of their truth and accuracy in this generation . you ca n't help but be lifted , be drawn , and get `` bout it '' for christ !
