fuzzy spectorswede power pop if you mix up the awesome primitives from the 80s , with the spector wall of sound , in a swedish garage with some power pop licks you might get something like the legends . that being said they are not rigidly classifiable . just great music . this was one cd i was glad i got and have played it the most in the last couple of months .
