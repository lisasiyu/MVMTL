good stuff , great sound very nice collection of mid to late 60 's top 40 tracks . first time true stereo on `` love is all around '' and `` whiter shade of pale '' , and even the ones you may have already sound better than ever . i might have left off `` keep on dancing '' for something that has n't popped up on a dozen other compilations , but that 's a minor gripe . i do n't think that any oldies collector will be disappointed with this cd . like the other guy said , just buy it .
