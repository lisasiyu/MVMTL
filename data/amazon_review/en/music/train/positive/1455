who cherishes the ladies ? i do clear , sweet voices are the main attraction of this cd , with well-chosen male guests to sing those songs best delivered in a masculine voice , like & quot ; bonny blue-eyed nancy & quot ; and & quot ; queen of connemara. & quot ; the selections range from lively reels and jigs and the tongue-twisting ( well , maybe not if you 're celtic ) & quot ; an poc ar buile & quot ; to the haunting & quot ; broom of the cowdenknowes , & quot ; & quot ; down by the glenside , & quot ; and my favorite , & quot ; erin gra mo chroi. & quot ; this is another new-to-me group that i plan to collect more of
