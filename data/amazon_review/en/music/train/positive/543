best rap group there will ever be this is undoubtably the beasties ' best cd . there still great now , but on here they 're more rap/rock , which they left behind later on for straight up rap/hip-hop , which is n't a bad thing . most rap nowadays really sucks goats ( *cough*cough50centmikejonesliljonseanpaulpaulwall *cough*cough ) . this great disc features such classics as girls , no sleep til ' brooklyn ( the beasties best song ) , rymin and stealin ( which has a rather nice tribute to the clash ) , fight for your right , hold it now hit it , and the infamous brass monkey . if you 're a fan of any rap or rock , i highly reccomend this amazing cd
