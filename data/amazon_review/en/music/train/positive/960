don henley 's other best solo album the end of the innocence is don henley 's other best solo album , along with building the perfect beast . the title song , like `` the boys of summer '' from the previous album , made me realize that looking good for my favorite actresses was more important than attending food-related reunions at my old school , especially since most of the staff i knew are gone and many of the changes there have not been for the better . `` i will not go quietly '' and `` new york minute '' made me realize that looking at photos of attractive female celebrities is a good way to inspire myself to avoid an individual i 've had issues with before i do myself in over it , whereas `` little tin gods '' and `` if dirt were dollars '' skewer hypocritical preachers and gossip columnists , respectively , and `` the heart of the matter '' , like the title song , is about letting go , whether of a lost love , a grudge , or your past . overall , the end of the innocence is an album with great music and multilayered lyrical messages . the fact that henley believes that the young australian tourist jailed in indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was wrongfully convicted makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears and your conscience
