excellent passion , a collection of some of the most popular young worship leaders ( including chris tomlin , charlie hall , matt redman and david crowder ) released hymns ancient & modern in 2004 . there is some interpretation of the hymns , and a couple have a chorus added to them , but on the whole the artists stay quite close to the traditional tunes . to `` o worship the king , '' for example , chris tomlin adds the chorus , `` you alone are the matchless king / to you alone be all majesty / your glories and wonders , what tongues can recite ? / you breathe in the air , you shine in the light . '' some of the standouts on this album are `` the solid rock , '' `` all hail the power of jesus ' name , '' and `` all creatures of our god and king . '' the liner notes include a brief description of each of the songs along with information about the author . it is quite a good album if you enjoy the `` passion '' sound and are able to enjoy hymns with a bit of a worship music feel to them
