so here 's where the beach boys went ... when i first heard a song from this album ( sliding doors ) i was driving on i-5 , on my way to pasadena . i pulled off and bought the cd . i give it half a star over the 4 rating , and it would it be worth 5 if the boys had axed & quot ; right kind of girl & quot ; . there is something painful about the 'siamese cat ' line . probably i just do n't get it . & quot ; your big night & quot ; is steely dan adeptly finessed into the 90s . & quot ; star behind & quot ; may have been inspired by the moody blues or the hale-bopp cult troop , i dunno , but i like the pulsating yet dreamy arrangement . my fave track is & quot ; all dreamed out & quot ; . it is a satin doombox
