start here if you 're new to branford this is the first branford i heard ( back in 1990 ) and i 've heard a lot of him since . i sometimes find his stuff hard to get into , but his sound is so pure and the music so honest and driving that i keep coming back to it . also , and this is definitely worth mentioning , his band is hot and jeff & quot ; tain & quot ; watts is an astonishing drummer . in any event , contemporary jazz , the dark keys , bloomington , the beautyful ones , and especially the recent footsteps of our fathers are all quite stunning albums , but they require comfort with free and intense music . if you already dig 60 's coltrane and ornette , go for it . if not , and you want to jump in and hear why people think branford is so good , crazy people music is a great place to start . you get the fiery intensity of the later albums , but the tracks are easier to digest and the melodicism of the themes ( and the solos ) is more accessible to those less familiar with his style . i would n't start any earlier in his career , because you get his more & quot ; bop & quot ; influenced style , which he has evolved past ( though he still has that sweet tone ) . trio jeepy is another place to start , but i think it too , though a fine album , does n't give a complete sense of his mature sound . i gave this four stars , because it 's not his most amazing work , but i do love it and have come back to it regularly over the last twelve years . if this gets its hooks in you , you 'll like the later albums ; if this sounds overwhelming and , well , crazy , you 'll probably find the later albums only more so
