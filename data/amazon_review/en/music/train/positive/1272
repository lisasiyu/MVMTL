the height of an amazing career some artists are good enough that to label one work as their best says more than a lot . nick cave is by all means one of them . and 'your funeral ... my trial ' is that golden release . beginning with the slow title cut , it moves it 's way through track after track , sometimes menacing , sometimes violent , sometimes beautiful , and always thought provoking and dark . highlights ? honestly , all of them . warning , this album is nick 's least accesable and that says a lot too . but after a few good listens , it works it 's way into your brain and it 's the best thing since ever- i promise
