my second favorite lp of all time this is one of the greatest hip hop albums i 've ever listened to . in my opinion , murs has never sounded so good . his flows are vivid and realistic and the production fitted them to the tee . i thought every song was extremely dope . i highly recommend this in your collection . i know this review will not make me popular w/many but i have to write it how i honestly feel . save the negative remarks for someone who cares . i know murs is not the best mc of all time . i 'm not sayin that . he 's far from it . i 'm sayin this is my 2nd favorite album of all time simply for the overall feelings i get from it every time i put it on . i 'm sure if you want some heart-felt/feel-good hip hop music this will suit you . peac
