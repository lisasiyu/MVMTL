one of the best rap albums of the year the further adventures of lord quas is the trout mask replica of rap . madlib , much like captain beefheart , has a unique style that is hard to penetrate and hard to pin down . the songs on this album are n't really songs per se , they are more like random clips and odd ball samples with the occasional spattering of rhyme thrown in . the album is dizzying to listen to . their must be 50 or 60 little mini skits , song fragments , and other oddities sprinkled through the album . all this combines to make one of the best and innovative rap albums to come down the pipe this year . madlib/quasimoto has created an innovative and unique production style that he created with the first quasimoto album the unseen , continued with the excellent madvillian record , and continues to refine with this production . overall i think that his production sounds more complete on this record than on madvillian . what makes this a weaker release than madvillian is the quality of lyrics and the mc involved . quasimoto is not as good as mf doom . quasimoto seems to be riffing on doom 's style throughout , and his voice can get kind of irritating . he sounds like eminem on helium and without all the homophobic gay bashing . it 's an interesting trick , kind of like what prince did on if i was your girlfriend , but extended for a whole album . his style can be grating though . overall , the further adventures of lord quas is a good album that fans of off-kilter alternative rap will love . if you like dr. octagon , mf doom , peanut butter wolf , or aesop rock , then you 'll enjoy this . you want to be patient with it though , madlib 's style is like peeling an onion , you need to remove some of the outer layers before you can get the full effect of it .
