a eulogy for the living wow , i just received `` reiter in '' and am in agreement with other reviewers . chris whitley has always been a favorite of mine , ever since the stunning debut of `` living with the law '' . i saw chris on tour supporting that album in seattle , on a double bill with toad the wet sprocket . the auditorium was packed with young seattle suburbanites to see toad , then when chris took stage , half the place emptied out . the faithful , knowing remainders witnessed a typical chris show ; searing , passionate , but also flawed and overly amplified . chris chain-smoked the entire show , and said little to the audience , but when i left i knew i 'd seen an artist with no peer . `` reiter in '' is an amazing cd-probably for the first time , chris sounds like part of a band and not just a phenomenal solo artist in front of backing musicians . although unpolished and recorded to analog , the band is cohesive , lending a jukejoint feel to chris ' guitar playing . this music does n't even directly compare to his previous stuff-it 's got elements of led zeppelin/the black keys/ '' achtung baby '' u2 , with some depression era blues tossed in between . rather than annotating his impending death with dusty acoustic dirges , chris gave us sweaty , soulful , life-affirming music , a most fitting end-note
