macerating metal noise fired by sheer punk genius i bought this album when i was 17 . i 'm now 31 and i still have n't recovered ! this album , as said before , represents the indie punk ideal only feinted at by nirvana , sonic youth etc . steve albini and co assault you here with a white-hot mind-melting onslaught of musical savagery , from the beserk guitar-driven colombian necktie through the nosebleed-inducing pavement saw to the juddering , sinister colossus of tiny , king of the jews . sheer uncompromising overbuilt punk , this represents big black at their zenith . with bands like this in the world there 's no excuse for mediocrity
