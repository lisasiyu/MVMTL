great , but a step back this is a solid rock album . but it 's not as good as their previous effort & quot ; spiritual machines & quot ; . the sound has more bottom to it ( thanks to bob rock -- or no thanks ? ) but at the same time it is n't heavier , which is strange . at first i was very disappointed with the album ( i have all their previous recordings ) , but it eventually grew on me . however , if this is a new direction for the band , i do n't know if i like where it 's going
