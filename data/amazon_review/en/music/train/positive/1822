the new powerfull voice of latinmusic -- anais ! i followed anais from the tv show that discovered her `` objetivo fama '' and show after show , performance after performance , she was always the one to beat ! i always knew she would win the competition . she is beautiful , has a strong & powerfull voice , great personality and a true talented star . her first cd just recently released `` asi soy yo '' is a hit ! her first single made popular by the great ednita nazario `` lo que son las cosas '' has been 4 weeks at # 1 on billboard charts and the cd debut at # 11 ... not bad for her first release ... . i love the ballads `` que te pedi '' and also her reggaeton songs : sexo , sexo and suelta , they will in no time get to the top of the charts as well . i recommend this cd by anais to anyone looking for a spanish album full of ballads & reggaeton . anais is here to stay ! ! !
