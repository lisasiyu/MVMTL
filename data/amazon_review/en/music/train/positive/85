magic time this cd will really grow on you . so listen to it several times before you make your final judgement . it is one of van morrison 's best . this cd appears to be almost autobiographical at times . especially stranded ... just like greta ... they sold me out . his jazz background , his irish background , his blues background ... are all present on this cd .
