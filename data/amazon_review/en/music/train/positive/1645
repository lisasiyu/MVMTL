one of my favorite albums of all time . she is an amazing songwriter . not only is pink an amazing singer , but her lyrics are soo deep and personal . i love people who write about the sad times because a lot of people needs to hear something they can relate to . family potrait speaks to a lot of people , including my brother , who overhead the song and keeps requesting me to replay track 7 . the whole album is a work of art so it 's hard to choose , but if i had to choose , my favorites are do n't let me get me , just like a pill , family potrait and lonely girl . pink 's voice is soo raw and real that you can actually feel the pain in her voice . once you listen to this album , you will want hear more . so i will go ahead and let you know that her third album is try this and her fourth , which is her best thus far is `` i 'm not dead '' . so please give this album a chance . pink is a real artist and she will be around for a long time because she is true to herself .
