great momentum and continuity the first cd is 5 stars . it has great continuity that carries over from track to track . the combination of vocals and non-vocals is just right because you do n't feel burnt out by one or the other . one of the cooler parts about the first cd is tracks such as under the sun make excellent use of your left and right speaker channels . there is this weird echo effect that moves from your left to right speaker that is amazing if you have a good sound system . normally music makes inefficient use of the speaker channels , but a few songs selected by armin goes against this trend . these days there is a lot of good electronic music out there , but messing with the speaker channels immerses you even more in the acoustic environment . all the songs armin picked become remember able classics once you hear them several times because a few do sound monotonous . the second cd is 3 stars . it does n't have the energy and momentum that cd1 has and there are n't as many vocal tracks to break up the electronic beats . armin could probably have introduced more variety into cd2 such as breakbeat , house , and tribal , but it is what it is .
