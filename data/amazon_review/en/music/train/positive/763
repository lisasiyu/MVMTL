sarah fan ? - buy this now ... i was n't a sarah fan in 1999 when the `` mirrorball '' tour came through my backyard , where `` mirrorball '' was recorded live , at portland oregon 's rose garden . but i had become a fan , and was at her show , when she came through with the `` afterglow '' tour . by the time `` afterglow '' was out , i had just discovered the original mirrorball cd and dvd , and up until the release of this 2-cd set , the original `` mirrorball '' live cd and dvd were my `` most played '' cd and dvd of my whole 700+ various artist collection . but even before finishing the first cd of this 2 cd set , i know that i had to have another copy for the car . sarah fan ? you must buy this now . i promise you wo n't be disappointed . it is the full show , with all of her interactions with the crowd , and the sound is better than either of the previously released mirrorball cd and dvd titles . i love live music , and this set is a dream come true . sarah is a true performer `` live '' , and i think is actually at her best when performing `` live '' . absolutely amazing recording and performance on this newly released 2-cd full concert live set . and if you get a chance to see her perform , pay whatever it costs to see her show
