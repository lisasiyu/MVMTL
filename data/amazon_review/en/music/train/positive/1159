yer brain on spin cycle this is one of my top 10 cds of all time . check out my other reviews and you 'll probably be surprised . but this cd left a lasting impression on me when i was like 16 or so . it has some of the most well-crafted sy songs in my opinion and some of the sweetest , sublime , fuzzed out guitar sounds ever . track 1 is the perfect song . track 2 ( junkie 's promise ) rocks harder than anything they 've ever done . they played it on conan obrien and tore it up ! ! ! track 3 is beautfully hypnotic in a tripped out sort of way . this is the track that first reeled me in as i was under the influence of wild irish rose watching my friends play tekken 2 . track 4 ( washing machine ) is a very episodical and visual song which morphs from dischordant punk to a chill summery breeze of a jam that slowly winds down into practically nothing . kim gordon 's snotty tuff girl attitude shines through more than ever on songs like 'little trouble girl ' and 'panty lies ' . how can any true fan of alternative music hate this cd ? good experimentation with noise and distortion , yet structured songs ... better than previous `` expermmental jet set '' album . give it a whir
