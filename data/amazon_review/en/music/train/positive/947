typical excellence if you are looking for a disc with first-rate interpretations of some of the standards in brass band literature , this recording ( and its somewhat more refined volume 1 ) begs your attention . all of the performances are extremely clean and precise , and the technical requirements of these works are often extensive . there are the moments of overly sentimental playing and wobbly vibrato that was so off-putting to vaughan williams in his henry v , but nothing outside of the standard practice in most british brass bands .
