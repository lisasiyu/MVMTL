the best singer you 've never heard of ... .. i first heard joe carson back in the early -70 's while going through some of my folks ' 78 's . at first , i thought it was webb pierce ( on one of his best days ) ; then i distinctly heard hank ; on the other hand , there was the sound of ray price ( his cherokee cowboy days ) . all of these sounds came from a young kid ( 16 when he started performing ) who should have , by every right , been the most heralded country/hillbilly/honky tonkin ' singer ever ; and yes , that includes even the great hank williams . but , joe carson 's life was cut short just as he was hitting his stride . if there was a way to rate this collection higher than 5 stars , i would not hesitate to do so . as with all of the bear family records releases , this one is an outstanding collection , beautifully recorded and mixed , and a thorough set of liner notes/booklet . not only does this album showcase the stellar voice of joe , the backing band ( all legendary members of the hank thompson era ) will knock your socks off . while there are 33 songs here ( 3x more than most current releases ) , there are a few real standouts : `` i got ta get drunk '' , `` the last song i 'll ever sing '' , and `` shoot the buffalo '' all showcase his voice . and , there are a few old favorites here as well , inlcuding `` fraulein '' and `` who 'll buy the wine '' . this is one of those albums you have to own ; and i can assure you , you 'll be shaking your head in amazement at joe carson 's talent . a+++
