this is a great cd ! i 'd never thought i 'd like debbie gibson , but i guess i was wrong . most of her songs on this cd are great , and i aboulutely love them . i personally like `` out of the blue '' , `` foolish beat '' , `` only in my dreams '' and `` shake your love '' . they are all good songs . she is very talented and mauture for her age . although i was n't a teen back then , i have heard of her . if you like 80 's music and are a debbie fan , then this cd is for you . this cd gets me going whenever i listen to it . i like pop music and 80 's music for that matter too . hope this review is helpful to you .
