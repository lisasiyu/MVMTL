sweet shock their fans ! the sweet shock a few of their fans here and jump from bubble-gum to rock . from the first 30 seconds of track one `` set me free '' for good or bad , you know those days are gone for ever . in the process they acquire an entirely new audience . the sweet have attained their adolescence . although they do not have total control ( yet ) of the final product , they are now penning many of the songs and are breaking free from the nest . this gives the band new energy and motivation which is evident in the final product . as adolescents , gone is the `` goodie two-shoes '' image . the topics now range from fast cars ( rebel rouser ) to bi-sexual women ( ac-dc ) . in the 70 's the `` moral majority '' still ruled over freedom of expression , so these subjects are dealt with some subtlety and an occasional bit of humour . oh yes the music ... i could decipher the music for pages but i 'll let you do it . someone once wrote that sweet was a fly by night , 3 chord churning and `` very limited talent wise '' band . alright then `` smarty pants '' , compare pat benatar 's cover of the song `` no you do n't '' to the original sweet version . compare the drums , guitar and vocals . then you can make-up your own mind ... great stuff ! ! ! an excellent deal with all those extra tracks .
