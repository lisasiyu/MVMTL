great cd/dvd i keep seeing all over the reviews that this is intended for kids . i am 40 and the owner of a studio . i have been involved in music production since 1985 and i have got to say that the music this duo is putting out is phenomenal . not only is the music fantastic , but the production is flawless . my daughter watches disney channel which is where i was first exposed to aly and aj 's music . i was blown away when i first heard `` rush '' and when `` chemicals react '' came out , i was convinced that `` rush '' was n't a fluke and decided to buy the cd/dvd . with the exception of the two cover tunes at the end of the cd , this disk is awesome . do n't get me wrong , they have done a great job on the cover tunes , i just do n't know why they put the covers on it ; their stuff blows the covers away . this cd is definitely not one with just a couple of good songs ; they are all good . i 'd recommend this cd for anyone who likes modern rock .
