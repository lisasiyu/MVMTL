greatest album ever made . keane is one of the greatest bands of all time . the fact that they use piano/keyboards/bass/drums on every song , with no guitars at all , shows that they are more musically sophisticated than all the other mindless guitar rock that 's out there . there are more than enough guitar-based bands . `` somewhere only we know '' is the best song of all time . beautiful lyrics , solid piano backbone , and a steady , moderate tempo , make it a brilliant album-opener . the album has upbeat pop/rock , like `` bend and break '' and `` this is the last time , '' slow , sorrowful ballads , like `` she has no time '' and `` we might as well be strangers , '' gentle , peaceful melodies , like `` sunshine , '' and slightly ethereal , unearthly ones like `` untitled 1 '' and `` bedshaped . '' plus , all the lyrics are intensely personal and honest , ones that everyone can relate to , in one way or another . all together , the album is a classic , one that ( if the american public knows anything about music ) will live on to be known as one of the greatest albums ever made . every song is a masterpiece . there are no fillers .
