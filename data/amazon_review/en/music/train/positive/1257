wailers sophomore album this 1973 follow up to the wailers debut `catch a fire ' is mainly a collection of updated singles that had been doing the rounds on the jamaican underground scene for years . `get up , stand up ' and `i shot the sheriff ' are two of the most hitting cuts the wailers ever recorded , but the rest of the material does n't have the same mass appeal of their other albums . this is more an album for hardcore fans of reggae than the general audience . it 's a cool set but `burnin ' is n't an album i can bump too much
