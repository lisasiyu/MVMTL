wonderful i loved this cd by enrique iglesias . i was never a big fan of his until i heard this cd . the music was so beautiful . i did n't really know what the songs were about because i do not know much spanish , but the songs moved me . some of them were so beautiful i wanted to cry . this cd is well worth the money of buying
