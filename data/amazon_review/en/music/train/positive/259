first melodic death album originally released in 1993 , dark tranquility 's skydancer remains a masterpiece . along with at the gates , in flames , carcass , death and edge of sanity , dark tranquility created the genre known as melodic death metal . everything expected of a good melodic death album is here . aggresive sounds juxtaposed with acoustic parts , an inteligent concept and growled vocals . mikeal stanne is one of the only vocalists who can sound pissed off and peaceful all at the same time . many of the ideas such as using female vocals for different effects were way ahead of their time as well . ca n't give a perfect rating though because while it 's original , the production is n't very well done and they had n't quite hit the peak of their skills yet
