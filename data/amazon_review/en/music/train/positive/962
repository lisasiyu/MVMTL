avenue blue i have found that anything that jegg golub does is absolutely wonderful . he has managed to take artist like eric claptan , johnny lang , stevie ray von , bb king , seagar and the list goes on , and gives you alittle of everyones style all in one song and then mixes his own style in to boot . all of his work is a must hear . if you like soul , blues , and jazz . here ya go . brenda burnet
