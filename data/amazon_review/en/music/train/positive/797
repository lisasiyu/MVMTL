pretty well as good as innervisions just a bit less evolved . the songs on this album are absolutely brilliant . with a wide range of styles , there 's something on this album for everyone - only the songs you and i and you 've got it bad girl are anything less than fantastic , in fact . you are the sunshine of my life - very good , original song . not his best , but still good . maybe your baby - an awesome groove , nice synth bass , but maybe it goes on a bit too long . you and i - not a bad ballad , nowhere near as good as blame it on the sun , but has its own charm . tuesday heartbreak - very joyful sounding song . good tension between the verses and chorus , great melodies throughout , and excellent drums . you 've got it bad girl - a bit jazzy experimental . not bad . superstition - good dance tune , very funky , with a powerful horn riff that peter gabriel would later rip off in 'sledgehammer ' . big brother - awesome clavinet tune , angry lyrics , nice melody . blame it on the sun - this is one of the best ballads , written , ever ! really . he does this kind of ballad on every album , but this is the best of them , with a soaring ( or wailing ) verse that slides into an emotional chorus . lookin ' for another pure love - very original music , freestyle melody . i believe ( when i fall in love it will be forever ) - this is a real triumph , this is everything a song should be , with an awesome chorus that repeats 10 times at the end and you 're not getting tired of it .
