i do n't understand i do n't understand what the previous & quot ; reviewer & quot ; was talking about , that miles was playing it square here . this is a beautiful , relaxed album , and one of the only quartet recordings miles did . plus , he plays the open trumpet on every tune . he made this album when he was waking up from his blue haze of heroin addiction , right before he went on to huge fame and success and you can hear all his new ideas formulating on this record . however , if you 're only accustomed to later miles davis records where he was fueled by fiery tenormen like shorter and coltrane , then maybe it might sound too laid back for you . i dunno
