a true contender for best album of the nineties with stanley road paul weller has managed to prove to his fans and his critics that he is still an important musician even in his solo days . he has n't written 12 good songs , instead , he 's written one great album . a factor in any great album is the overall feel that perpetuates each song , making them all feel as though they deserve their place and complimenting the songs that come before and after them . a mostly guitar driven album , weller fuses good solos and riffs with his usual effective lyrics , often ending a song with a long instrumental that gently ushers in the next song , which gladly and competently carries the album along . however , there is the occasional song that primarily uses the piano evoking another great feel . though these songs are quite different from the guitar based ones , they seem to come at just the right points in the album so that , not only are they a nice change of direction , but also they effortlessly fit in . stand-out songs are 'you do something to me ' , 'broken stones ' , 'the changing man ' , 'i walk on gilded splinters ' and of course the title track . to truly appreciate this fine album start at the beginning and just let it play on to the end . it far outweighs the sum of its parts , and as these parts are so good , you 're in for a great journey .
