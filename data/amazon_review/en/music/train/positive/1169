something different ... being a fan of mostly punk rock music ... i decided to give this a try . this record is highly entertaining , very fun and very original . i didnt even know that & quot ; gypsy-punk & quot ; existed untill i heard this . the musicianship is quite good as well . chanty , boot stompin ' songs with accordians and fiddles . i like it . i reccomend this if you like the more folky brands of punk rock ( ie swingin ' utters , tossers , etc . ) so , if you 're willing to give something different a try , go ahead and pick this up
