do n't you get it ? jeez , i feel like it 's the 70 's again ; defending mccartney : to anyone who does n't get it : his solo work is not the beatles . he never seemed to care as much about lyrics and `` meaning '' , as opposed to john and george , but focused on great melody , harmony , and catchy , if sometimes almost meaningless , lyrics . no one seemed to mind when he did it with the beatles ... ... ... all amazing . this album may be his best ; simple songs , simply recorded , heartfelt . his tunes and lyrics can be deceptively simple ( junk , man we was lonely ) but listen closely to what he 's saying . he does n't shove your face in how he feels , unlike lennon 's `` how do you sleep '' or even ringo 's `` boogaloo '' . this album is the first glimpse we all got into who did what in the beatles and , as basic as it is , opens a new door . still on my top ten
