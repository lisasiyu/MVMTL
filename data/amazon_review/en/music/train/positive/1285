wimpy , maybe ... but i do n't care . for those who need their music to be deep and thought provoking , then maybe this album is n't for you . for those who just want good melodic pop songs that crawl inside your head , then this is definitely for you . i play it from beginning to end without skipping a song . also contains deperate fools which ranks among my all-time carmen favorites . unlike most other solo material , there is a hint of disco in a few of the songs . in my opinion , 8 of these songs are b+ with the final cut an a+
