must have for any fan any moderate fan of the scarlett pimpernel , musical , book or movie ( s ) should own this cd . i absolutely love the songs `` believe '' and `` vivez '' which are not on the encore cd , and this disk is worth owning for them alone . i 'm not crazy about chauvlin 's voice on this disk , which is a bit pinched and his phrasing is awkward at times . for great chauvlin tracks ( like where 's the girl ) you definatly need to buy the encore cd . christine andreas 's renditions of `` only love '' and `` you are my home '' are also more dramatic and truely broadway versions on this disk whereas on the encore disk these are pop-versions sung by people who were not in the show .
