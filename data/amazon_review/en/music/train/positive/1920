not elevator music ! after listening to this cd a couple times , i will be keeping it on my ipod playlist for some time . it will come in quite handy when i want to drown out the voices of people with `` single phase '' minds ! yes , it is supposed to be relaxing ! comparing this to muzak is nothing short of ignorant ! on a better note , i would tend to agree that peter white is creative when it comes to mixing up his sound with other artists . yet another reason to really appreciate the jazz community . if you are a peter white fan , you will not be let down .
