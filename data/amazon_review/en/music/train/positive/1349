sarge reigns in the royalty of girl rock i 've loved this cd ever since we got it at my college radio station ... sarge definitely knows how to rock ! at the same time , the band shows good range so each song does n't sound the same . i especially love the lyrics , which express a spectrum of raw emotion and real-life issues , from a girl 's revenge for getting gang-raped to thoughts on & quot ; how far is too far ? & quot ; . the vocals are never overpowered by the music ( which says a lot because the music is definitely kickass )
