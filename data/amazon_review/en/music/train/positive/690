solid `` 2nd '' solo release for jd for his `` 2nd '' solo album ( even though this as well as `` life in 1472 '' have guests on most to all of the songs ) , jd did a good job . i 'm not a huge fan of his but this album is solid . guests are mostly to thank for that , as well as some great production ( that he always seems to pull off ) . of the 13 songs on here ( it does have a lot of skits/interludes ) 1 is a classic , 1 or 2 are near classics , 4 are ok , 1 i skip , and the rest are good . for those who have heard jd before , you know what to expect , songs about women and flashing and flautin his money , nothing new . production is also good , jd takes part in 11 of the songs ( he produces 1 and co-produces 10 ) and swizz beats & neptunes each do a song . i 'd recommend this album for his fans or fans of that kind of rap . # 2 - 10 ( classic -- great beat -- f/ ludacris -- also onone of his albums ) # 3 - 8 ( f/ ugk & manuel seal ) # 5 - 7 ( f/ boo , gotti , usher , r.o.c . ) # 7 - 9.5 ( f/ jadakiss & a good hook from freeway -- nice beat ) # 8 - 8.5 ( f/ nate dogg ) # 9 - 7 ( f/ bilal ) # 11 - 9.5 ( great beat -- f/ manish man ) # 13 - 8.5 ( f/ nate dogg , r.o.c. , trey lorenz , katrina -- nice beat ) # 14 - 8 ( f/ clipse -- also on their `` lord willin '' album ) # 15 - 9 ( f/ jagged edge -- great beat and story ) # 16 - 7.5 ( f/ kurupt , field mob , eddie cain , backbone ) # 18 - 5.5 ( f/ da brat & kandi ) # 20 - 7 ( f/ xscape ) jermaine dupri -- b . 9/23/73 -- atlanta , ga check all my review
