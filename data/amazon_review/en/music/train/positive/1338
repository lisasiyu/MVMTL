celestial divinity hymns if you love untainted hymns , you will be blessed by these lofty recorded selections performed by the london philharmonic choir and national philharmonic orchestra . two discs compress over fifty hymns to be savored over and over . and no ... these are not light and airy , please-every-ear compositions , but are the solid rock truths of the faith . you can even attune to the atoning blood of christ harmoniously exalted . my only displeasure was found in the absence of sing along lyrics . to decipher all the stanzas , owning a hymnbook is a must . it is important to obtain one while supplies still exist ... i am not completely kidding . my husband and i were at a used book sale where a man was overjoyed to actually find a hymnbook . he wanted to learn the comprehensive praises that are cunningly being pushed out the back door of most churches .
