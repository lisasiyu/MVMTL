classic cuts and new sounds . just in time for their induction into the rock n ' roll hall of fame comes this new blondie collection that showcases some of the band 's most popular , influential songs , material from their recent releases and a mash-up with one of the bands that influenced them . `` sound & vision , '' like most best of sets is both a good introduction to the band 's music and a well-assembled collection for the casual listener who likes blondie , but enough to purchase every album . there is no doubt that debbie harry and the gang not only produced good music , but were one of the main reasons why we have real chick rockers like shirley manson , gwen stefani and yes , madonna . befire princess diana ever graced magazine covers , harry was the most photographed woman in the world but a real punk at heart , posing at times with such figures as joey ramone and iggy pop ( eventhough at one point patti smith told her to `` get the f -- k out of rock n ' roll '' ) . `` sound and vision '' nicely shows what all the fuss was about in the late 70 's through mid-80 's . a lot of the songs have survived the test of time with a real sense of fun and energy like `` call me '' with it 's roaring chorus and electro sheen while `` heart of glass '' is still a classic jam , disco has died and yet this song remains . `` rapture '' is still a long , dreamy anthem that brought hip-hop to a wider audience before aerosmith and run dmc ever broke the barrier of rock and rap . newer material is also present here , `` maria '' was a single off the band 's 1999 album `` no exit , '' but it still has that classic blondie sound . however i do believe listeners are cheated here when it comes to the song `` good boys '' off their latest release , `` the curse of blondie . '' the original version is a great song , but the remix here makes the song kind of cold and hollow , the same for the `` in the flesh '' remix which rips the song apart , turning it into cold , techno sludge . luckily there is one worthy remix present , `` rapture riders , '' which brilliantly meshes `` rapture '' with the doors ' `` riders on the storm . '' both songs flow perfectly together and it 's a fitting combination since blondie have always named the doors as a prime influence and favorite band . too bad jim morrison died in 1972 , you get the feeling he and harry would have done a marvelous duet . the extra dvd that comes with the set is a must for blondie fans , many of the band 's videos are included for classics like `` heart of glass , '' `` the tide is high '' and even the recent videos for `` maria '' and `` good boys . '' `` sight in sound '' a fun ride through the blondie catalogue and a must for collectors of classic rock anthologies , and a neat teaching tool for those who wan na know why girls like gwen , shirley and even britney have been scandalous and glamorous and know how to pull it off and who they learned it from
