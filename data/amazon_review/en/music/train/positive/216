psychedelia classic ! `` the who sell out '' is one among ( at least 3 ) several who master pieces . with its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting , the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining who album . 1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the who were among the pioneers of that trend . this is obvious from the first track of the album `` armenia in the sky '' . the outstanding single `` i can see for miles '' is among the very best psychelia songs recorded . the acoustic `` mary anne with the shaky hand '' is another who favourite - beautiful melody , great rhythm and intelligent lyrics . actually the lyrics are overall great on this album - with wit and homour . songs like `` odorono '' and `` tattoo '' are rarely included on who compilations - and they 're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album . `` our love was '' and `` i ca n't reach '' are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album `` a quick one '' . i might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case . these short tracks works great in the context of the album . only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place . townshend 's acoustic `` sunrise '' is quite beautiful , but `` rael '' feels somewhat longwinded and dated . most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format . try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals .
