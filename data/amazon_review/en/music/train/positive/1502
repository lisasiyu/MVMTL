solid gold i admit , i rediscovered spandau ballet after hearing the song `` gold '' over and over while playing grand theft auto-vice city in 2003 . so i bought this cd recently . it 's a very complete spandau collection for the casual fans . die hard fans may find a missing song they think should be included but the major hits -- '' gold , '' `` true , '' `` communication , '' `` chant no . 1 , '' are all here . i 'm not too much feeling the black and white cover , but the booklet and interior design make the set a very impressive `` best of '' collection
