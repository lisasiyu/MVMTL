phenominal ! madman across the water . wow ! this is an essential elton john album . by now , most are familiar with the opening track , tiny dancer . beautiful piano and a melodic falseto set the tone for this , my favorite elton john tune ( and i have many ! ) . levon and the title track are also two huge standouts of this album . this is less a collection of singles with filler as e.j . has been accused of creating later in his career . taken as a whole , this album is simply a masterpiece . madman was created before the flashy goodbye yellow brick road days , with all the pomp and ceremony that came along with it . here 's you get the feeling of a new artist , hungry and clawing to get to the top of the pack . he 's succeeded with this effort and has n't looked back since . if you 're a partial e.j . fan and are looking for some of his slightly more obscure work , madman across the water would be a perfect and thoroughly enjoyable choice
