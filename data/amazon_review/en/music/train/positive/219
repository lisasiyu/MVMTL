great release , a little raw ... . i was introduced to mcr through three cheers for sweet revenge , which is one of the best albums to ever be released . i brought you my bullets , you brought me your love is a very , very good release . all the songs are awesome , and the intensity and ferocity that drew me mcr in the first place is well in place on this album . but , it seems that they were still finding their sound and direction on this album . very good album , but the recording is very raw , semi-okay production . but nevertheless a great release that you must check out ... my favorite song is drowning lessons
