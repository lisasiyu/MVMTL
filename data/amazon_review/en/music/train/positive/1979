great re-issue with extra niceties ... i 've been listening to pt for several years now , and have found their music most moving . i really would n't care if they sound like pink floyd , or whomever . i do n't believe that steven wilson sits around trying to imitate one group or another . i think it could be said that most artists have their influences from many sources , from many inspirations . so , thank you steven for re-issuing this cd , and adding such quality and care to the songs . i believe you will influence many other future artists with your creativity . you certainly influence me to listen and enjoy . after all , my son and i travelled over 150 miles , one way , just to see pt in michigan , and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the concert
