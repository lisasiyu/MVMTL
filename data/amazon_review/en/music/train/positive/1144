sing your fool head off ! this album has become surprisingly influential . it was the first album to feature celebrities singing badly . i remember the first time i heard it ; i laughed my head off . it spawned three sequels and several imitations . hey , it even helped revive william shatner 's career ! of course , shatner 's unforgetable renditions of & quot ; lucy in the sky with diamonds & quot ; and & quot ; mr. tambourine man & quot ; are the highlights here , but there 's much more . shatner 's first mate , leonard nimoy , who was the most prolific actor/vocalist ( five albums ! ) , has two amazing contributions here . everybody 's favorite butler , sebastian cabot , has two songs from his spoken word album where he overacts bob dylan lyrics . speaking of overacting bob dylan songs , you should here what eddie & quot ; green acres & quot ; albert does to & quot ; blowin ' in the wind & quot ; . jack webb recites & quot ; try a little tenderness & quot ; in his best joe friday monotone . i could go on and on , but i will get to the point and say that & quot ; this album is hilarious & quot ; . i highly recommend this album to anyone who likes funny music
