surprisingly good for a hit single i got this album because it was recommended to me by amazon.com 's computerized recommendations system . being adventurous , i bought it on a whim . i was very pleasantly surprised ! unlike many other popular trance anthems with female vocals , this one is not at all cheesy or monotonous . all of the tracks feature high-quality production and skillful mixing : no amateurish boom-tss filler anywhere on this single . mavie marcos has a gorgeously supple voice ( reminds me of kirsty hawkshaw ) and nice pronunciation ( i know that it 's not politically correct to say this , but it bugs me when the vocalist sounds like a chavette who has gone through accent-reduction training ) . i highly recommend this cd to anyone who has good taste ! even idm snobs will appreciate the intricate layering of sound in these tracks
