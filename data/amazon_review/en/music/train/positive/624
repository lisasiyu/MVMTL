musically flawless so how about that ? a mahler second that actually moves ! the result is one of the most exciting readings of all time . it 's truly legend . this is one of the two greatest mahler seconds . here mehta , who can often be an oddly questionable interpreter , lightens the music at just the right level , making it brilliantly unique . instead of allowing the music to sink into itself , like most imitations of bernstein 's classic reccording . music has to move , it has to speak , it has to breathe.. never has mahler been so logically accessible and tended for . the experience gained from this recording is greatly edifying , if not spiritual . technically however , its not perfect : one thing that makes it somewhat lacking . sometimes the orchestra is not really synchronized . precision is sometimes sacrificed for mehta 's ingenious creativity . however , to me these sort of flaws just make the piece more homely and natural . the vienna is of course fantastic in sound . brilliant , but deep and always resonant . this is some masterpiece material . a truly excellent cd
