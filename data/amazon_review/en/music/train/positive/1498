melodic death metals manum opus i really like all of kalmahs previous releases , but they seemed to be lacking in some way ; like they were on the cusp of something great but just couldnt push it over the edge . well now they have . this is the best melodic death cd i have ever heard ! they simply took the best elements out of every band out there and forged them into something amazing . the synth are a not so in your face version of children of bodom , the lead guitar harmonies are a beautiful mixture of dark tranquilites fast stacato riffing mixed with the violence and melody of old in flames . the softer parts alude to my personal favorite 'insomnium ' . this has been the only cd i have been listening to for several weeks now just because there is no reason to listen to anything else . kalman has perfected the genre ! all hail .
