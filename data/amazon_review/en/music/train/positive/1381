lisa gerrard lisa gerrard 's music moves me in ways that no other singer/musician does . being a dcd fan , i bought mirror pool & duality the day they were released . ( they are still my favories ) the insider is a great movie . some of the best work i have seen from crowe & pacino . lisa captures the mood ( much like she did with gladiator ) with her special unique voice & style . lisa 's music has a powerful effect on me and makes me feel as if i am going through a re-birthing . the sadness & pain of letting go of the past coupled with the hope and anticipation of what is to come . the struggle & release cycles throughout her music but always leaves me feeling at peace . meltdown at the end of this score fits perfectly . i love to meditate to lisa 's music and let her take me on a beautiful journey . art at its finest
