11 years later ... and i 'm still listening to this gem . to be honest , i bought this in spite of `` kiss from a rose '' . i hated that seal was getting so much air play becaus of that song ... not that the song was bad or anything , but i fell in love with his first album , and i thought `` kiss from a rose '' paled in comparison to tracks like : `` future love paradise '' and `` violet '' . all these years later , i can still enjoy listening to this cd . i am writing this review because i just popped it in while at work . there is n't a bad track on this thing
