very enjoyable i 'm writing this review to respond to a reviewer 's frustrations that the liner notes he received were those belonging to the `` sweet dreams '' album . this happened to me as well when i bought the cd from borders . so , i got a refund for it , bought a copy from barnes and noble , and the same thing happened . finally , i took my money to best buy , and found the correct liner notes ! so , the barnes and noble/best buy shipments must have been faulty . for those interested in purchasing the album , i found it quite enjoyable . i 'm too young to have had the original lps , so any bonus tracks released were nice to have . i found the photos intriguing as well , once i had the correct booklet ! in my opinion though , it was worth the effort to have the correct liner notes
