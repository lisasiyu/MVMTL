bob dylan rocks with the band though dylan and the band had played together a lot before this record ( the basement tapes and the 1967 tour ) , this is the first recording of them together that was released and i must say the band 's playing on this record is vastly different than those times , different than the live `` before the flood '' as well . i get almost a lose , playful feeling from them here , driven by garth 's excellent keyboards and robbie 's stunning guitar work . love songs , dirges , uplifting songs , tough songs and torch songs , this is a record for the ages . yes , it was overshadowed by `` blood on the tracks , '' but it 's been years now and still `` planet waves '' stands the test of time . i really like this record
