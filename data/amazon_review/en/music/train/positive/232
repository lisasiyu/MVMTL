language , context and music this is a somewhat interesting exploration of language , semantics and rhythm . it is more surreal in it 's use of deconstructed conversations placed with new and different contexts . some of it reminds one greatly of korean samul-nori music , which relies mostly upon percussion and rhythm that is based upon the korean language ( listen to no . 6 , `` an animated description of mr. maps '' for a very clear example of such . while some tracks are very ingaging and suggest a different musical line of exploration from much conventional music , there is a problematic sameness in instrumentation that is sometimes very uninteresting due to a lack of musical development . the books could end up doing very well if they were to invest more time in their musical development of their ideas and instrumentation . layering samples can only go so far before it is boring
