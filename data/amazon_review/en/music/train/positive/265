good stuff first off ; i really appreciate artists or labels that give you at least 60 minutes of play time and do n't cut out lengthy guitar solos . this cd certainly delivers in this regard as ronnie earl and the duke trade guitar jams in creative duets for a solid 70 plus minutes . this is a close 5 star recommendation but it is n't a classic and it is n't groundbreaking ; although i would think some reviewers would seriously disagree with that point . it 's just damn good music by two pros whose different styles compliment one another . highly recommended .
