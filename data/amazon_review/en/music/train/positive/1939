this album is amazing this is the greatest piece of music i have ever heard . out of my 300 cds , i listen to it the most . it is great to work out to , to drive to , to do anything to . i 've been listening to it for 12 years and still find sneaky little percussion nuances that i did n't realize were there . everything else by talking heads and byrne solo , while still brilliant , is not on the same plane . hilarious lyrics , irresistable grooves , totally original songwriting , white hot rhythm , a masterpiece . when was the last time a song made you feel angst ridden and ecstatic at the same time ? `` something ai n't right '' does .
