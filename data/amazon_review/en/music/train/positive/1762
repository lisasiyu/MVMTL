38 special stomps ! the guys in this band have a sound with size-12 shoes . if you like this band , i suggest you try the allman bros. , lynyrd skynyrd , and creedence clearwater revival . standout tracks are rockin into the night , hold on loosely , wild-eyed southern boys , fantasy girl , caught up in you , if i 'd been the one , back where you belong , and like no other night . the question is : where is this band ? it 's awesome . they need to make a comeback .
