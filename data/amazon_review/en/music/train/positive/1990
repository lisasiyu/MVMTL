one and only michelle tumes although not as beautiful as her previous release ( s ) this album is still a triumph of beauty . her voice is still undeniably pleasant here , and every song has its strength . personal highlights include 'the light ' , 'image of ' and 'blessings flow ' . certainly a complete change of style from her older work , but still more than sufficient for any michelle tumes fan and anyone into christian music
