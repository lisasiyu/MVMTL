marvellous i have n't bought an album for such a long time because who needs to spend the extra cash when there 's online piracy ? but i have to own this . feinstein 's voice is so pure and versatile ; he is funny at a moment and the next , he can be so heartbreakingly bittersweet . his performance is first class , and one has to consider that he can sing so well at a live concert .
