the soul is `` grande '' sweet surrender ! ! ! that 's the song that got me into bying this album , and what a album ! on `` move with me '' he takes me on a ride in the same vibe as the stones have . `` get on top '' equally great with his sex frustrated voice in peak condition . the flow on `` hong kong bar '' is simulair to the feeling you get from the doors `` riders on the storm '' and closing make it right is dramatic as few . there is a few not so brilliant songs but mixed up with these mindblowers that just dosent matter ... if you love jeff then learn to love..
