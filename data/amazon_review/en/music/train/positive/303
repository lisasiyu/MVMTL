ahead of it 's time , excellence in musicianship and production there is not much to say about this album that has not been said already . it was the first of many albums that solidified the jump of the british psychadelic band pink floyd into the worldwide limelight , unsurpassed jagernaut that it became . it has a very timeless sound , and flows effortlessly from one song to another and just takes you through an unsurpassed journey from beginning to end . time , money , us and them , and brain damage are my amongt my top 20 floyd songs of all time . if you need to own one floyd album , it should be this album . pallatable to all old fans , and to new ones .
