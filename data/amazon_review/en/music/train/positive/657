best smooth jazz cd of 2005 ! recently i undertook the challenge of burning a `` best of 2005 '' smoothjazz cd . the challenge was daunting , being limited to approximately 15 tracks . four tracks came from this wonderful cd . gregg karukas , always a skilled keyboardist , has outdone himself with these wonderful tracks . track 1 , `` girl in the red dress '' is a fun , upbeat way of beginning this musical adventure . track 5 , `` first flight home '' is an immensly sexy and driven song . track 7 , `` corner club '' is a combination of absolutely haunting to so much fun . and then there 's track 8 , `` isabella '' . in my opinion the best single smoothjazz track of 2005 . it is the kind of track , when a friend asks `` what exactly is smoothjazz ? '' play `` isabella '' for them . they 'll understand . buy this cd , you 'll love playing it for years to come and the artists deserve your support for putting out music at this quality level .
