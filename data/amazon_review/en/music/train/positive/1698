wow ! oreja de van gogh really 's beyond comparison . i recommend it to anyone who enjoys imports as much as i do . its really a mix of pop , rock , ska , raggae , electronica , and ballads . i got this cd thinking it would have the song & quot ; cuidate & quot ; in it , without even checking on the back , but i was n't disappointed when i realized it was the wrong cd . & quot ; cuentame al oido & quot ; is simply mesmorizing , and & quot ; viejo cuento & quot ; and & quot ; dile al sol & quot ; are really cool too . listen to the entire cd..it 's good for a variety of moods . enjoy
