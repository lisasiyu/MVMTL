... and oceans flat out rawk ! the futuristic vibe they get on this album is outstanding . intelligence is sexy is a great song , so is tears have no name and espirit de corps is outstanding . every other song is very solid . the vocals have this vibe that no other band creates , the vocals are nearly alien in nature . if you like metal songs that get into a groove and keep it buy this album . they are kind of , in a weird way , an actualized voivod for the new century
