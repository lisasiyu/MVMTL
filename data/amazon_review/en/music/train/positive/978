amazing i love every kind of music and i recently was introduced to tom waits . my faviorte genre is metal but i cant stop listening to this guy . his voice is amazing and all his songs are wonderful . pasties and a g-string ( at the two o'clock club ) and step right up are my faviorte on this cd . i own a few other cds by waits and i have yet to hear this guy make a bad song
