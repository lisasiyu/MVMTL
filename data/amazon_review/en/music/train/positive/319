if the beach boys grew up in compton ... psychedelia and hip-hop . those are two words i never thought i 'd be relating when referring to one of my favorite albums of 2005 . i still ca n't get over it . what a phenomenal idea . the boston based rapper edan possesses more than just an untouchable flow . he 's also the producer , programmer , engineer , sampler ... you name it , he does it all . the production held within is bafflingly perfect . he 's successfully brought the feel of a 60s psychedelic record to the form of hip-hop , including the concept . clocking in at roughly 34 minutes ( as most 60s psychedelic records run ) , there is absolutely no wasted space . this is an album of epic proportions that rides the line of psychedelia and hip-hop cleaner than you can imagine . it 's almost puzzling that a hip-hop record including heavy influence of the beach boys ' `` pet sounds '' , the beatles ' `` sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band '' , or pink floyd 's `` piper at the gates of dawn '' would come off as such a cohesive set of gems . but it does , and edan proves he 's the man for the job . the album 's intro , `` polite meeting intro '' , starts it off with some music that could be from sponge bob squarepants , then with the addition of trippy sound effects and vintage english vocal samples , we end up in the beatles ' `` yellow submarine '' . it sets it off nicely . then comes `` funky voltro '' featuring insight , which includes a high-pitched swooping minimoog played by edan , and also a funky guitar sample . then comes `` i see colours '' , a clear standout featuring a synthesizer played by edan . edan proves to have a impenetrable flow here , boasting some imaginative lyrics that work very well with the sweet atmospheric soundscapes and soothing 60s vocal and guitar samples . the next cut , `` fumbling over words that rhyme '' , is also one of my favorites . edan pays homage to some of the great innovators in hip-hop , including run d.m.c. , grandmaster flash flash , melle mel , kool moe dee , ll cool j , slick rick , nas and ultramagnetic mc 's among others . it seems that a lot of rappers tend to make an `` homage '' to old-school emcees , but edan simply does it better by explaining `` why '' they were true innovators , which is much better in the eyes of this reviewer . `` murder mystery '' is a sweet track with some music similar to jimi hendrix 's `` are you experienced '' with that reverse rhythm , then cuts in with instrumentation that sounds like it could be from the old `` odd couple '' tv show . the next cut , `` torture chamber '' featuring flows by percee p , speeds things up with a dirtier beat , orchestra string arrangements , and a background pink floyd sample from `` dark side of the moon '' . then comes the best collaborative effort on the album ; `` making planets '' featuring mr. lif . lif was actually the one who turned me on to edan , as he was featuring on lif 's `` emergency rations '' ep and his critically acclaimed `` i phantom '' . the production is especially creepy here , as lif jumps in towards the end at the climax of the song . `` time out ( segue ) '' is a tripped out interlude that blends perfectly to the next superior cut , `` rock and roll '' featuring dagha . which features some cool crunching guitars in it 's very memorable production . i also love this lyric - `` my mental fabric / to big for lenny kravitz / who imitates jimi hendrix in every facet '' . `` beauty '' is up next . this song is really one of my favorites . like it 's title , the soulful production is beautiful . the addictive reverse rhythm , tight drum loops , and soaring flute makes it a huge standout . i also love this lyric - `` i use pens like hallucinogens '' . it mixes beautifully into `` the science of the two '' featuring insight once again . this is another one of my favorites ( it just keeps getting better as it goes ) . `` smile '' is one of the trippier tracks on the album . he could n't have closed out the album better , than with `` promised land '' , definitely a standout . it 's got a very memorable production , and some sick lyrical spitting from the one , the only , edan . i see some people complaining about the short run time ( 34 minutes ) . i on the other hand , think it 's perfect . there is so much filler in today 's hip-hop ( underground included ) , that it 's nice to have 13 powerful , memorable , carefully crafted tracks to concentrate on . i 've spent most of my teen years listening to 60s and 70s psychedelic records , along with a wide array of classic rock , so it may be a bit more intriguing to me than the next hip-hop head , but this stuff is truly unique . edan may have been paying tribute to hip-hop 's greatest innovators lyrically , but he 's also paid tribute to 60s and 70s psychedelia in one of the most memorable ways possible ; through hip-hop
