fantastic album riot act should have won album of the year ! although listening to the album 4 years after it was originally released , i am so glad i got back into pearl jam . i have not listened to pearl jam since high school -- i ca n't believe i deprived myself for so long ! pearl jam is the best rock band of my generation . hopefully , they will stick together and put out several more albums down the road . for those of you not sure if pearl jam still has it , trust me they do ! ! ! buy this album , you will be in for a pleasant surprise ...
