the magnificent one , the beautiful one , the one and only one ... this album sizzles with energy , honesty , and `` i 'll make you pay attention '' entertainment spirit . this was his big breakthrough album and it 's not hard to see why . every single track is excellent , and each very different from what went before . from start to finish , the emphasis is on simple beatleish rock arrangements , played with finesse by a great backing band , with the piano front and center . it starts off with plain rock and roll - moving out , with its thumpy rhythm and brilliant ending . the stranger ( apart from its stylish intro and outro ) is a bit more funky , with a lovely bridge/chorus . the much maligned just the way you are suffers from a bit of cheesiness in production ( billy joel calls this `` phil ramone 's bossa nova version ) , but is still a good heartfelt song for his first wife ( whatever happened to her anyways ? ) . the centrepiece of the album is scenes , this is billy joel 's tour-de-force to show everyone what he can do on the ivories . vienna is a beautiful ballad , and only the good die young is a hilarious dance tune , still racy 30 years later . always a woman is played a bit stiffly on piano , and borders on cheesy lyrics , but still a great tune . the next two tracks are a *bit* weaker , but have their moments and are still brilliant songs , just in comparison with what came before ... he came close to topping this album on glass houses but this still stands as his finest album . if you 're going to have just one of his albums , i would recommend this .
