rap classic this is most possibly the illest rap cd to ever hit stores . the two headed monsta black c and mr cee , along with company , cellski and hitman put together pounding beats , sick flows , and sweet hooks . the rhymes are very creative . the highlights of this album be `` blue bird '' best track on the lp , `` bounce to this '' gets your pumped for the album . `` i got my nine '' . `` niggaz on the jock '' `` m.n.o.h.p '' `` pass the zig zags '' and `` dedication '' but all the tracks pound . this gem from rbl posse is a must have for any west coast rap fan
