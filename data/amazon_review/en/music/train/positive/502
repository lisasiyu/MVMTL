just good fun music this is a great album . it is perfect for doing chores at home , driving in the car or plugging away in the cubicle . i took a chance on this ablum because i enjoyed `` pins '' and `` maps '' from fever to tell and i am glad i did . `` golden lion '' , `` way out '' and `` cheated hearts '' are my favorites .
