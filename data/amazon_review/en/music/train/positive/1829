hip nostalgia martin denny died last week . the end of an era for me . as a kid i would grab my father 's vinyl lp 's of exotica and quiet village and transport myself to tropical lands beyond my dreams , listening to denny 's soothing sounds and exotic bird-call melodies . julius wechtler on the vibes was one of my early favorites . ( i actually saw him , as leader of the baja marimba band as the opening act for wayne newton ! ) when all my little pals were buying lp 's from some english group called the beatles , i was kickin ' it to martin denny . this re-mastered double cd is a trip right back to those magical days in front of my parents `` hi-fi '' ! and without all of the snap-crackle-pop of the originals ! awesome ! ! as long as martin denny 's music lives , so will he ! ! aloha , mr. denny ! and thanks for everything ! keep a mai tai ready for me at that big don the beachcomber bar in the sky !
