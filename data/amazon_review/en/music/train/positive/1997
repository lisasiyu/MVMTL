pleasingly melodic , her best work yet ! i have follow ana throught her beginnings as a member of the spanish pop band mecano and became very intrigue by her angel like voice and absolutely progressive themes in her earlier years with the band . i very much anticipated a new release from mecano but when i heard the band had split up assumed that her career was over . i was very delighted to hear she had went on as a solo and knew that her new cd would probably become a new classic in my cd collection . i found every song in this release as pleasing as all her former recordings
