in his element ... i am not a clay-mate ... howver , clay aiken is without-a-doubt the best runner-up from any season of ai . that being said ... i still was n't sure if i would like this cd . and i did n't -- -at first . but then , after hearing it a few more times , i actually grew to like most of the songs . not all of them , which is why i did n't give him 5 stars , but it is a very good album . my favorite happens to be the title track . but , there are several more good songs on the cd . whether or not you are into this style of music , you ca n't argue that clay aiken has one of the best male voices around . probably the best male voice of his age . i would recommend this cd to any one who is into adult contemporary . of course , if you are a clay-mate , then i do n't have to tell you anything :
