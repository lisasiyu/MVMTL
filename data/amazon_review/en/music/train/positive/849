dayton says : buy this cd from the intimate clubs of the world to the stage at kennedy center in washington , dc , lynne arriale continues to prove why she is the first lady of melodic jazz . i do not believe that i can adequately describe her music and that of the great lynne arriale trio , and so i would encourage you to listen to some of the `` cuts '' here at amazon . not only is lynne an excellent composer , she and her trio interpret the music of other 's like no one else . listen to their interpretation of burt bacharach 's `` a house is not a home '' and see if it does n't rip your heart out . i can not recommend the music of the lynne arriale trio enough . why not take a moment and enrich your life buy making a purchase of the trio 's latest release : inspiration . and , while you 're at it , if you do n't have their other recordings , may i suggest to add them to your music library as well . you will not be disappointed . i am happy to end this review in the way i most often like to : dayton says : buy this cd
