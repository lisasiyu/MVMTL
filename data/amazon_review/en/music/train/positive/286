electric version this album was released three years after the new pornographers awesome debut album . this album is similar , but has a more glossy feel than the previous album . the album is definately more polished . great synths and percussion throughout the album . electric version is an enjoyable and easy listen , chock-full of hungry hooks and brimming with indie rock 's classic humility
