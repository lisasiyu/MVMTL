proof that music ai n't dead yet . there are people out there listening to the radio . they want to be rescued . long since tired of riding dirty on a honkytonk badonkadonk that makes one want to la-la , there are some that would argue that y2k was really the day the music died . ( if not even sooner , but those folks did n't like nirvana , alice in chains or soundgarden . go figure . ) well , anyone who 's heard `` gentlemen '' or `` congregation '' or any other record by the afghan whigs should be yelling `` rescue me , dulli ! '' and on `` powder burns , '' greg 's delivered the goods . possibly the most soul-infused yet forward-thinking rock record since the whigs ' `` black love , '' the new twilight singers record still should n't be construed as an afghan whigs album without the name . despite dulli wearing lead singer shoes , which definitely aids in stamping any project with a signature raspy-throated , tunelessly-endearing sound , the backing band and instrumentation are a far cry from the rabies-inflicted punk animal that was the whigs . sure , it 's dirty , dirty , grungy blues-rock , but one might be surprised what creeps into a song here and there . `` bonnie brae '' is a melancholy headbanger that could almost be called blue-collar shoegaze . piano and violin pepper tracks like `` there 's been an accident , '' while rushing , watery electronic influence is lovingly splashed here and there , most obviously on the intro piece `` toward the waves '' / '' i 'm ready . '' of course to think ahead , people usually end up looking back to see how good music was made in the first place . dulli liked smashing beatles riffs around on his covers record so much that he 's taken to purloining lyrics , too , reframing the timeless refrain of `` she loves you , yeah , yeah , yeah '' with a derisive sneer and a cranky guitar din ( `` forty dollars '' ) . not every word on `` powder burns '' is an homage , however . lyrically , dulli has always struck me as a singing charles bukowski . sometimes it 's exactly who you need to hear from to fall asleep at night when you 're too bleary-eyed to read
