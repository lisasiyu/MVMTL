where 's the beef , alf ? i 'm afraid alfonso lozada has missed the point . the film is about a span of time in the life of one person , tony wilson , and is thus structured around his experiences . at the same time , the film is not a documentary but a fictionalized account . on top of all this , the & quot ; tony & quot ; character does mention the short shrift the stone roses get . is it really a surprise to find the soundtrack album bereft of artists which did not appear in the film
