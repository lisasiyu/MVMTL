no computer problems here ... i have n't had any problems loading or playing this disc on my computer ( pc w/ windows xp pro ) . it ripped into itunes just fine and then transferred to my ipod , where it also plays flawlessly . i have a ton of problems with drm software on the warner brothers cds ( like the new flaming lips album , grrr , which amazon does not warn you about ) , but this disc works just fine for me . perhaps norton , ad-aware , or hijack this ! are preventing programs from being installed on my computer without permission ? as far as the disc goes : this is the first brmc disc i 've picked up and after five listens , i really like it . it 's a laid-back , mostly acoustic disc which in some places reminds me of the jayhawks or the eskimos , and in other places reminds me of the o brother ! where art thou ? soundtrack . there 's even one track ( restless sinner ) that sounds a bit like the grateful dead . there were a lot of songs with religous overtones ( pretty much the entire back half of the album , actually ) , which was surprising at first but not jarring enough to distract the listener too much . on the whole , this is a nice , peaceful album , relaxxing without being depressing
