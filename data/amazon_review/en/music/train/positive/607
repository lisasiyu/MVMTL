think i need a sunrise check out augustana , without doubt last year 's most promising new band , completely despite the fact that its own record label -- that 'd be epic , which has been in a tailspin since polly anthony left -- seems to have no clue whatever that they exist . their debut album , the extraordinary all the stars and boulevards , was tossed thoughtlessly into the marketplace a year ago and , minus even a modicum of press or publicity , got promptly crushed in the avalanche of fourth-quarter releases ; its soaring title track -- one of `05 's most potent -- was so thoroughly shunned by radio that it had to be a conspiracy . so how 's this for a dark horse story ? practically as an afterthought as spring closed , epic chose as boulevards ' second single the wistful , resplendent `` boston '' and then sat on their dead , numb rumps while the song -- helped along by a simple but exquisite video that opens with a close-up of the band 's twenty-one-year-old ( ! ) lead singer dan layus ( think 3 doors down 's brad arnold with a more agile voice , and much much cuter ) and fades to black with a shoreline of overturned pianos destroyed by the incoming tide -- built steadily , week on week , against all conventional wisdom which states that summer , with its easy melodies and breezy sentiments , is the wrong season in which to try to launch a complex , chorus-less single whose heroine is drowning in depression and desperation , and whose back half , in lieu of a repetitive refrain , rockets to a soul-cleansing , cobwebs-clearing climax so fiercely orgasmic you need a cigarette to regain your bearings . now there 's some genuine heat swirling around the song -- enough so that epic re-released boulevards last week with extra tracks , an increasingly common industry practice that continues to just rankle me , if for no other reason than i 'm enough of a lunatic to plunk down money twice for the same motherflippin ' record , and that 's what they count on , but if it helps augustana become the raging success they richly deserve to be , all will be forgiven .
