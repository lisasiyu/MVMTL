a superb voice faith hill 's latest cd 'fireflies ' is wonderful , not necessarily because of her choice in songs , but because of her beautiful voice . i have been a fan of faith 's since the beginning and i must say her music does n't disappoint . while the songs are not as strong as say the songs on 'faith ' , they are still quite good , particularly the songs written by lori mckenna . after hearing faith sing her songs , i went out and bought lori 's album 'bittertown ' , which is quite simply an incredible album . on 'fireflies ' faith masters each song and brings such a beautiful interpretation to each song . songs that i particularly enjoy are `` stealing kisses '' , `` i want you '' , `` paris '' and `` mississippi girl '' . i 've read other reviews that said 'fireflies ' left them confused . the album 's songs do lack cohesiveness at times , but overall the album is still a must-have if only because of faith 's voice . she has , without a doubt , one of the most beautiful and pure voices in music
