supurb and deserving tribute i 'm also 33 years old but my parents actually had the lp of this great album . ( what 's a cd ? ) however it 's been collecting dust for 25 years since it 's too worn out to listen to . plus , where is that darned old record player anyway ! after recently acquiring this lp on cd , trust me , you 'll be glad to hear this fine & quot ; tribute to the best & quot ; in true 21st century hi-fi sound ( cd quality ) . oh yeah , the songs are all good to , but i 've loved this album since the '70s . ahh haa
