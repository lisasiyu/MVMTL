nice sophmore effort the alice cooper band 's second album sees the band still recording for frank zappa 's label . the music starts to turn in the direction of the material that would later make them famous . no real macabre stuff yet , but the album is definitely a progression from their first one . the album was produced by david brigs who is probably best known for working with neal young . the opening track , `` mr. and misdemeanor '' has always been a favorite of mine and a great example of alice 's talent for playing on words . `` shoe salesman '' , `` below your means '' , `` return of the spiders '' , and the short but cool `` refrigerator heaven '' are all good tunes . the finale of `` beautiful flyaway '' and `` lay down and die , goodbye '' is also a great way to end things . the alice cooper band would be signed to capitol and hit the big time with their next release . `` easy action '' would be a strong stepping stone to get to that point .
