a man of many colors jack white has done it again ! this is my second white stripes cd ( first being elephant ) and it does not disappoint . jack white still has that raw sound with shredding guitar and screeching vocals . this album seems more mature in a way but at the same time , you know it 's the white stripes from the opening riff and when jack 's vocals come in . red rain , white moon , and blue orchid shows that jack white loves to put color in the titles as well as in his songs as there are a few different styles . my favorites , though , are blue orchid , my doorbell , and i 'm lonely ( but i ai n't that lonely yet ) . i think i still like elephant better but one thing is for certain - the white stripes are n't fading away anytime soon . i love his led zeppelin/nirvana style voice and ca n't wait to hear his new band , the raconteurs
