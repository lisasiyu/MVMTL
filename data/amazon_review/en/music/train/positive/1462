i 'll take some more ... i believe this was one of their strongest and smoothest cd 's they ever put out . fourplay is one of smooth jazz 's best supergroups . i have worn out this cd along with `` elixir '' , which is the next best one in my opinion . `` yes , please '' was the last cd before `` heartfelt '' . although heartfelt was good , it seemed like they are going in a different direction . i just previewed `` journey '' and i have to say that i most likely wo n't be buying the cd , i 'll just buy certain songs . if you want the definitive fourplay collection , get every one of their cd 's from the self titled debut to yes , please . you might even pick up `` heartfelt '' . if you want one of their best cd 's , get `` yes , please '' ! !
