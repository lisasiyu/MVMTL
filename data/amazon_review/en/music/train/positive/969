looking for more like this album ? melanie white and other reviewers have wondered what else out there might be similar to `` appalachia waltz . '' i highly recommend oliver schroer 's double-disc `` o2 '' . same fusion of folk fiddle idiom and classical violin . in places astoundingly brilliant . lovers of bach will see many influences here ( yet i would n't call schroer 's work derivative . ) in the liner notes , schroer talks about making his work not just polyphonic but also fractal -- funny thing is , the more you listen , the more `` fractal '' it sounds . unbelievable .
