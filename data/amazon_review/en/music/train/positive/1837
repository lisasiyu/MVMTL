i saw them live wow on the reviews . they are much deserved . i saw the wipers live a number of times . remember they formed in about 1977 . so i wouldnt call them post punk , but maybe the first westcoast punk band . the nirvana connection is warrented , since kurt cobain was a big fan of the wipers and saw many live shows . i agree with the others , the wipers arent a punk band . what is punk anyways . im 44 and heard the ramones in 1974 , were they punk , no , they were pure rock n roll . greg sage has a style that defines original . greg if you read this , i saw you a bunch of times at the satyricon . also some industrial part of portland when the microphone hit you in the teeth . you missed about a half of sec , then kept singing . greg and the wipers , thx for the memories . zenorecords.com go to buy greg and wipers itmes . btw , roky erickson rocks . check his music out also .
