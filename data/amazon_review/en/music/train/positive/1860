this , is music i recently put my vinyl onto a cd , and had a chance to revisit this be-uuu-tiful work . i agree with another reviewer that `` sweetheart '' alone is worth the price of admission . if you like a combination of jazz , blues , pop ... heck , no labels necessary . in the words of her own song ( from another album : `` label it garbage/label it art/you ca n't call it soul/you 'll have to call it heart '' . so if you love serious good music , get this album
