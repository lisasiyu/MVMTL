enjoy this tasty acoustic treat ... it 's hot ! ! when i make a long night drive home after a loud concert , i like to listen to something quiet and soothing . the pizza tapes is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks , it 's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing . during two days in february of 1993 garcia , grisman and rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape . as we all know , the recordings were stolen by the infamous `` pizza boy '' and soon they became property of the formidable grateful dead tape and cd trading community . several years later grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album . this is n't an album of electric jams , it 's rather impromptu , quiet and easygoing . some people might dismiss it as `` background music . '' however if you take a closer listen , the trio handles the traditional tunes and bob dylan tunes and the gershwin ( ! ) tunes with such skill , there 's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found . garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to . definitely a classic album and something i received with anticipation . i still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings . by the way , i love the cover art ... the cd case is made to resemble a pizza box . open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings . on the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items ( choice words from garcia ! ) i actually get the craving for pizza when i 'm listening to the album . the pizza tapes sure is one tasty album . great music and great pizza , what a winning combination !
