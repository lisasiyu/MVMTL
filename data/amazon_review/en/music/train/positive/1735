massive attack want your protection ! ! ! ! ! protection was released in 1994 . with tricky already having success with his own newly made group portishead , & with their massive hit album dummy just around the corner , there was alot of pressure on massive attack . so on the album they used everything but the girl 's tracy thorn on lead vocals to replace blue line 's female vocalist shara nelson , although she would return for the 1998 smash hit album mezzanine . the album begins with the lushous protection , the groups sound has definitely changed , as it 's more of a heavy beat than the first album & tracy 's vocals really work here . karma koma is next , this would be a very popular radio hit , and remains to this day perhaps the groups most well known song . three is quite a dark track , again tracy on vocals here , whilst the ellegant yet dark instrumental weather storm continues into the darkness . spying glass is a more of a hip tune , performed by del naja , whilst better things is a smooth sould tune , skillfully performed by tracy . euro child is suprisingly the first rap song since karma koma ( i say suprisingly as blue lines contained alot of rap tunes in it ) tracy 's on vocals again for sly , which returns kinda into the darkness , whilst if sly was kinda returning the second instrumental of the album heat miser is definitely in the darkness . the album strangely ends with a live rendition of the doors classic light my fire , but done in massive style , it has to be heard to be believed ! ! ! ! protection is definitely different from its predecessor blue lines & whilst i 'd definitely recommend it , i think i would advice people who are new to the group to buy blue lines first as protection may be a bit too much for them to handle at first . the band would continue their direction towards darker music four years later in the smash hit release mezzanine ! ! !
