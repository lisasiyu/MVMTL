misleading ciara does not have a pretty voice . her single `` goodies '' mislead everyone to think the cd was bumping , but that show in the hell was not true . this album has about 10 or 11 songs that are actually good . the following songs include ... goodies , hotline , oh , lookin ' at u , ooh baby , next to you , and i , other chicks and the title.i gave this album 4 stars and it show in the hell do n't deserve it . can i get a witness ! has anyone besides me notice that ciara ca n't dance and sing . everytime she perform this hoochie ca n't hardly breath . i guess they call that asthma ! ciara do me a favor . next time you bring out a cd , you need to breath , stretch , shake and let it go .
