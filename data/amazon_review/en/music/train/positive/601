more than surprised ... i heard `` dirty harry '' on upop xm and began thinking about taking a chance on buying the album . then my wife came home one day and said she heard a song on a local station and really liked it-but she did n't know the title or artist . the station helped when she emailed them and it turned out to be `` feel good inc '' from the same album ! the choice was now clear ! log on the amazon ! a first listen to the whole album was good , but not as good as i had anticipated . the second , third , and fourth listen hooked me good ! i even like the 2 cuts i first thought were terrible . now i will be getting a second album so i do n't have to share
