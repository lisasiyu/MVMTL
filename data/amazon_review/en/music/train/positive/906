pure jazz i was hapy to receive this cd and almost all of the songs play correctly but the last two songs will not play unless you do it manually . i have a high end harmon kardon system so that is not why . i cleaned the disc but still no straight playthrough . my wife is p'od since she does n't know how to manually start these two songs .
