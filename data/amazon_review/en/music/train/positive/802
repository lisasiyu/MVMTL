still great after nearly 30 years ! i first got believe it as a used record in the late 70 's . wow ! this cd includes 2 rather short lps , but you are getting it for the first one - believe it ! which was the single best hard-fusion record ever made . it 's also a great bridge from the world of rockers dabbling in jazz ( bruford 's early band , brand x , etc . ) to a real jazz outfit that happens to rock hard . i never tire of listening to this one with it 's wonderful blend of tony 's great drumming , some of the best guitar work holdsworth has ever done and just enough funk to keep it from ever getting too serious . buy it and crank it up
