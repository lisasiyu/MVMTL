overall and insiring and insightful book wow , what an inspiring book . it was recommended to me by a south african , whose ethnic background is caucasian , that to learn about south africa 's recent history and culture , one should read this book . this book is truly amazing and very , very informative . the civil rights struggle for equality and equal treatment is vividly depicted . the decades spent to peacefully open the government policies so that the citizens of the country can equally share the benefits and contribute to the improvement of their society is remarkable . one important point is that many individuals did not share their government 's oppressive policies and many , regardless of ethnic background , supported mr. mandela . his ability to unite a divided country is truly inspiring . if one wants to learn how difficult it is to live as a second class citizen , with very restrictive policies in a police state , this book is it . we in the us are very fortunate to have many freedoms and opportunities that we often take for granted . after reading this book , i am very thankful that we are a united country where we promote based on a person 's ability to perform , not their ethnic or religious background . reading colin powell 's autobiography `` my american journey '' one also gets a good view on how we in the us can achieve based on our own accomplishments once given a open , honest , and fair opportunity to perform our job .
