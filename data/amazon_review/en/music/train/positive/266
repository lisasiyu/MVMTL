the cold vein the first time i heard cannibal ox was last winter in my friends snowboard video . he did the intro over the first and in my opinion best track on the cd iron galaxy . basically that got me interested in the group and i later found out that they were correlated with one of my favorite groups ever company flow . i copped their cd , but waited a really long time to listen to it . it 's pretty futuristic , kind of abstract like deltron 3030 ( another one of my favs ) , while the lyrical content is nowhere near deltron ( hell , what is ? ) it is very good . i mean obviously you should expect to hear a lot of co-flow when you listen to this , so if you 're not a fan it might not be the best idea to pick this one up . the cd has some very good songs a b-boys alpha , atom , and another one of my favorites , the battle for asgard . however i think some songs on here tanked the whole album . for one- a couple of the tracks on the cd are weakly produced , stress rap & painkillers . and a couple tracks seems like they just sorted started thinking of words that rhymed in the studio and went with that , vein & real earth . basically this cd is 80 % genius , so 4 stars is what it gets-and to be honest i 'd like to just give it 3.5 because i feel they coulda done a lot better
