better with age ... supergrass is one of the best bands active today . their sound is both retro and current . not only can they make catchy music , but their musicianship is second to none . that said , this release took a few listens to grow on me , but it has certainly done that . each time it takes its place in my car 's cd player , it stays there for weeks at a time . i feel this is one of their better releases , and i anxiously await the next..
