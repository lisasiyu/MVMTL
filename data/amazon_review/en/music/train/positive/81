another classic album from prince prince 's 1981 album controversy is another classic album in his catalog . the title track is the standout immediately . this longer version than the single version features a prayer . the song is funky and effective . `` sexuality '' is a great disco/funk number . `` do me , baby '' is probably one of the sexiest songs he 's ever done . this full length version is the one to hear . `` private joy '' is another funky song which is another favorite on the album . `` ronnie , talk to russia '' is a short protest kind of song . same goes for `` annie christian '' , which he wrote about the shooting of john lennon , ronald reagan , various atlanta child murders . not as effective as `` ronnie , talk to russia '' but a decent track nonetheless . overall a highlight in prince 's career
