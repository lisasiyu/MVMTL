going and going ... it has been roughly one year since this album was released . as of today , i still find myself listening to it regularly , as this cd just has classic written all over it . the opening pair of songs are nothing more than tastes of what is in store for the listener . queens of the stone age may not have nick oliveri in it , but you can tell that this cd still kicks . all of the elements fall into play , creating a cohesive piece of music that captures your mind . you will find yourself rocking out with medication and someone 's in the wolf . you may find yourself singing along to the singles little sister and in my head . you may find yourself lamenting to long slow goodbye and i never came . in fact , there is not one bad track on this album . this one can be considered an overview of the band 's output from their inceptiion to today , as most of the songs sound like they could be from another album . that is why this one is amazing . it is definitely queens . it has the stoner grove from the first record , the pop elements from the second and the heavy parts from the previous effort . it also hints at what 's in storage for us fans in the future . lullabies is utterly amazing . the high quality of the songs , as well as the tendency for you to hit the repeat button suggest this one to be a modern classic . it is the kind of cd that our kids will be listening to in about 20 years . do yourself a favor . pick it up . now
