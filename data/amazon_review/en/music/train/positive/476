takes a while to appreciate first of all , i should state that i am the number one steely dan fan in the world and yeah i know , this is a fagen work . when i first listened to this cd i was unimpressed . same old same old . but listen again ( and again ) and it will grow on you . it will remind you of the days when you said to yourself `` this band is * $ % # @ good - i 'm glad so-and-so ( kathy ) turned me on to them '' . favorite track is `` mary shut the garden door '' - not because of the lyrics but because of the jazz .
