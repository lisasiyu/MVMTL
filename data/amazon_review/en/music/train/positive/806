buy the book and the cd ! this is a must-have cd for any parent who likes introducing the simple joys of great music to their kids . my mom and dad ( both in their late sixties ) enjoy listening , too , and my child can ask her grandmother about other songs from `` back in the day . '' get the book , too ! nicky 's really big personality shines through as he rubs elbows , er-paws , with some jazz heavy-hitters . your child will love the photos and will also discover some great new vocabulary words like bop-a-re-bop . the cd and book have proven to be a great gift combo . take a listen and enjoy !
