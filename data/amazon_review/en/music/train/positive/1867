these guys rock ! i first heard this band in the movie 'desperado ' . i have a couple of their cd 's and really enjoy the grooves while driving . if you 're a big top 40 fan , ( britney spears , etc . ) you may not like it . the songs are not cranked out of the radio play tune machine and have bizzare subject matter . keep it up tito ! p.s . i have tried with poor success to get my friends into this band , but i stand by my taste
