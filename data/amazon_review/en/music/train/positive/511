beautiful mendelssohn ! chamber music seems so right during the boisterous mechanics of the holidays and one sure respite from the garish noise of the external season can be found in works like the mendelssohn piano trios . here eugene istomin , leonard rose , isaac stern perform piano trios 1 and 2 in a manner that bespeaks camaraderie of the performers as well as a complete respect for these luminous works . some have called these works piano sonatas with obbligato and while for this listener that is an unfair judgment , eugene istomin plays the piano part with enough flair and thoughtful propulsion that he does at times sound the more important . but that is mendelssohn 's writing and not a self-aggrandizement of a pianist . the overall sound is simply superb . these two trios are some of the loveliest ever written from that era and the gentlemen performing them offer sophisticated and informed interpretations . the recording is excellent , the music is rarefied ! highly recommended . grady harp , december 05
