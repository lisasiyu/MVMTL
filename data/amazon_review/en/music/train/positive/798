and the hits just keep on comin' just by saying this has been quite a year for the veteran crooner would be an understatement in itself . barry manilow began 2006 with the predecessor to this time capsule by debuting at # 1 last february with the greatest songs of the fifties . in between that album release and this , he has continued to sell out his las vegas extravaganza , music and passion , five nights a week . the show is so successful that the las vegas hilton recently extended manilow 's contract through 2008 . he picked up his second emmy award this past august for the live on tape broadcast of that event , and with the release of this album , he has his highest-selling tally in a debut week than he has for any other album of his 32 year recording career . barry also holds the distinction of being the only artist of 2006 to have two top two records in billboard in one calendar year . when it came to recording his follow-up to the `` fifties , '' juggernaut , it did n't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the concept would be . all it took was clive davis to help sort out the material and all systems were go . for the critics who have tarred and feathered manilow since he hit # 1 with his very first single , `` mandy '' over three decades ago , you 'd think by this time they 'd cut him some slack . no dice . manilow has even admitted he would n't know how to react if he heard a kind word from a critic , the brooklyn-born writer , arranger , producer and crooner has always depended on the devotion of his fanbase . and it 's not just any fanbase . these people are hardcore fans , dubbed `` fanilows . '' on this cd , we are treated to thirteen chestnuts that made the 60 's one of the best eras in pop music history . the pop songs run the gamut of that decade offering everything from bacharach to the beatles and in between honest and original covers that include a sensational retooling of frankie valli 's `` ca n't take my eyes off of you , '' which kicks the disc off into high gear . other highlights among highlights include a duet with 60 's supergroup , the association , on their staples `` cherish '' and `` windy '' that barry cleverly arranged as a medley . elvis ' gorgeous 1962 ballad `` ca n't help falling in love '' is lusciously delivered as is the righteous brothers 1965 anthem `` you 've lost that lovin ' feelin ' . '' even the somewhat hokey # 1 dean martin single `` everybody loves somebody '' from 1964 fits in divinely as manilow gives it as much warmth as dino did over forty years ago . sinatra 's smash hit from 1966 , `` strangers in the night '' is so effective , franks ' daughter , tina , gave manilow a thumbs-up for a sensational interpretation . other pop staples included are the herman 's hermits `` there 's a kind of hush , '' bacahrach 's gorgeous song from '68 `` this guy 's in love with you , as well as his '69 oscar-winner `` raindrops keep falling on my head . '' the beatles shimmering 1964 ballad `` and i love her '' and bobby vinton 's 1963 `` blue velvet '' is just as haunting as the original while the mood on the 1962 love anthem `` when i fall in love '' originally a hit for the lettermen is optimistically heart-wrenching . the album ends on a positive note ( pun intended ) with the 1965 anthem for hope `` what the world needs now is love . '' never was that sentiment so true - never was a manilow album this gratifying . everything from song selections to manilow 's masterful arrangements to his honest readings , this record is easily ranked as one of the best of his storied career . look for the greatest songs of the seventies inside a year . it does n't take a fortune teller to figure that one out
