heartbreakingly beautiful michael hoppe is a treasure . from his earliest recordings until his latest , requiem , i have never been disappointed . solace does not have one track that you will skip over . the soloists , where there are vocals , are superb and speak straight to the heart . occasionally we are given a musical gift that lasts us a lifetime . this is one of those gifts . therese tappouni writer , workshop director , author of a time to reap and walking your walk , a woman 's guide to a spirit filled life
