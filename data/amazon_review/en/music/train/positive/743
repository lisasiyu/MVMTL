it 's been a great 9 years ... i fell in love with the cardigans when i was 10 with `` lovefool . '' at the time i liked the mindless bubblegum quality , but now , 9 years later i 'm ( amazingly ) still in love with them , though for different reasons . they grew with me , i guess , and when i think of the music of my childhood , the cardigans are it for me . it 's crazy that after listening to them for so many years i still enjoy them so much , but their music just does n't get old . if you 're debating , just try it ! at first the blatant pop my get on your nerves , but i like it because it 's ... . unapologetically pop . try dressy bessy if you like the cardigans
