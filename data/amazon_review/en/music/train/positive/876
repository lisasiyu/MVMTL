because the night great song . i love patti smith 's version but this one 's even better . that song alone is worth however much you pay for this album . plus you get other rare gems ( and great bruce songs ) such as fire , seeds and paradise by the `` c '' ( great title ! ) , not to mention killer versions of bruce classics such as rosalita , born to run , thunder road , badlands , darkness on the edge of town , the river , independence day , etc . whether you 're a completist or a huge fan of the boss ( i fall in the latter camp ) , you really should pick this up .
