it 's never quite let me go . at a rather hip friend 's insistence , i first heard this album in mid to late high school ( circa 1995 ) . seeing as that those years were ground zero for teenage angst and all that comes with being hormonal , confused , and lovelorn , i seized onto this band with a fervor ( right along with mineral , seam , and a few others ) . to this day , when i hear the opening bass chords and the swelling drums of the first song , i instinctively grit my teeth , get my rock face on , and prepare to air drum on my steering wheel . this is a powerful record , one that bends and weaves with a beautiful intensity throughout . the desperation of hardcore is still very much a presence in titr 's music , but it 's bound tight with melody , memorable time signatures , and pop-savvy structures . granted , garrett 's voice can drive people away from the band if they are n't willing to give it time ( he 's more than a tad nasal ) , but the songs stick with you . definitely an album to purchase if you 're even momentarily interested in the mid-'90 's tail end of the `` emo/post hardcore '' movement . as for the guy who suggested that the ep was better than this full-length , do n't believe it . get this , and dig in
