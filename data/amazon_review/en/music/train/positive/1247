michelle branch rocks ! i got this yesterday for christmas after hearing the song , `` you set me free '' used on the ice princess soundtrack , and i love it ! well , most of it . here 's my review of the spirit room . 1 . everywhere- 9/10- a fun and upbeat song . pretty good , love the intro to it . 2 . you get me- 5/10- it 's pretty , but just too slow to me . maybe it 'll grow on me eventually . 3 . all you wanted- 10/10- the best on the album . love it ! was this a single ? if not , it definalty should have been . 4 . you set me free- 10/10- like i already wrote , i got this cd after hearing this song on ice princess . really good and fun to sing to . 5 . something to sleep to- 7/10- ok. you should listen to it if you want to go to sleep . i still think it 's ok. 6 . here with me- 9/10- love the beginning and the chorus . it seems like a really good song for a party . 7 . sweet misery- 6/10- ok also . i just do n't really like how the chorus is and it 's too short . 8 . if only she knew- 10/10- fun and cool . one of my favorites . 9 . i 'd rather be in love- 7/10- sounds alot like sweet misery . 10 . goodbye to you- 8/10- this is a really pretty song about moving on in life . 11 . drop in the ocean- i do n't really get this song . i 'm not going to rate it . overall , this cd gets an a . it 's pretty good . i think you should buy it
