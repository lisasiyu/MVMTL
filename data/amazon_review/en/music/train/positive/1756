an interesting change this is different from most classical and instrumental cd 's i have . it is neat to hear the euphonium showcased . you can tell that adam frey has a great sense of humor , the album art is fabulous ! the album has a great variety , flight of the bumblebee is fantastic ! i highly recommend this cd for anyone who wants a little something different in their classical collection
