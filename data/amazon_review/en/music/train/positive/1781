billy becomes a star with his first hit album this album piano man put billy joel on the map , even though his cold spring harbor album was also excellent , but did n't get very much distribution originally . of course `` piano man '' is one of my favorite pop/rock tunes in the history of music , but really this whole album is superb , and there 's not one bit of filler on this one . of course `` the ballad of billy the kid '' is classic billy joel , and the same with `` captain jack '' . the rest of this album is n't excellent but very good . billy just could n't do any wrong during his 70 's heyday , and this was just basically the beginning of his huge success . billy was probably the best pop/rock songwriter of the 70 's , and the material on this album happens to be some of his best compositions . in short billy flat out rocks , so rush out to your music stores and buy this gem of an album .
