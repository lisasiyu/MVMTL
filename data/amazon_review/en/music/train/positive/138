'taking me far ... far as a rental car can go ' beck rules ! ! i 'm one of those people who did n't really *know* anything about beck . oh sure i knew his hits - `` loser '' , `` where it 's at '' , `` the new pollution '' et al . just never really thought much about the guy . until ... about three months ago when i downloaded a couple tracks from this album from napster2go ... '' e pro '' and `` girl '' . after giving them a few listens i downloaded the entire guero album not long thereafter . i do n't know what to say that has n't already been said by a lot of others here- it 's been voted one of the best of 2005 for a reason . this is an awesome album . during a looong road trip i played some of the tracks for my better half and he gradually got addicted ... starting with `` earthquake weather '' . now it 's not only this album but pretty much the entire beck catalog for the two of us : ) even the songs i started out being `` meh '' about grew on me ( and hubby ) big time . just a great album ... musicianship is spot on , and beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony ! the tracks which are standouts ( at least in our opinion ) are e-pro ( great kick start to the album ) ; que onda ' guero ( love the lowrider horns throughout , along with the `` hey ! guero ! '' random shouts ) ; girl ( catchy ... this should have been a huge hit ... ) ; earthquake weather ( haunting melody , great riff ! ) , hell yes ( hai ! ) ; and i really love rental car ... just a cute little song - way too short ... also catchy riff and verses ! do check this album out . absolutely a gem
