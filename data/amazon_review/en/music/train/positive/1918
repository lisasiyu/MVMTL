the sweetest of symphonies this album has it all . utterly gorgeous . bittersweet symphony serves as a classic opener , complete with luscious strings . a perfect video clip to match too . do n't try walking down a busy city street while listening to the song . you 'll start trying to imitate ashcroft 's negligent and arrogant swagger . while sonnet is sweet , the rolling people and come on are epic , angry , arrogant songs that just make you wan na sing out loud and just go off . it 's an adrenalin rush in your ears ... . lyrcially , the songs are deep . ashcroft is a fascinating lyricist , and his sentiments in weeping willow and the rolling people are endlessly intriguing . 70 minutes long , but it 's a soaring sensation . every song has merit , even neon wilderness that is pivotal to maintaing the perfect flow of the album . a must have for any one who likes british rock . one of the most important albums of the 90's..
