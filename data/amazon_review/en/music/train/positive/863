great rythym section as a jazz guitar player , i personally love stan getz , and to hear him with ray brown , one of my favorite and greatest bass players ever . this was also the first i have listened to herb ellis play , his parts are a bit quiet but hey all guitarist were quiet until charlie christian . all in four really great musicians playing together , if you like this , check out russell malone , ray brown and monty alexander 's cd .
