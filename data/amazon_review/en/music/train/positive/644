great , but only a sign of what 's to come one of the early judas priest albums , here we find rob halford 's voice slightly different ( something that would be complained about 20 years later with the release of an album with the band two ) and starting to change into the voice we hear on albums like `` british steel '' and `` screaming for vengeance . '' all of glenn tipton 's and kk downing 's signature guitar licks are on here . all the songs are good ( there 's even a priest classic ... '' beyond the realms of death '' ) but this album is far from being their best album or even in the same league as albums like `` hellbent for leather '' or `` british steel '' . but , do n't get me wrong . it 's good for an earlier release , but other than that ... get one of their later albums first . 1 . exciter-5/5-good drum intro . the song is catchy for the most part and rob halford does some great screetching in this song . 2 . white heat , red hot-4/5-this song 's ok , but i think the part where halford says `` white heat , red hot . '' is annoying . 3 . better by you better than me-3/5-his voice sounds more like it did on later albums , but this song does n't seem really inspired . 4 . stained class-5/5-great song ! the music on this track in particular rocks . 5 . invader-5/5-this song took a while to grow on me , but it 's a very cool song . 6 . saints in hell-5/5-i like the title and the lyrics . the song has some great sounds . 7 . savage-5/5-this song is really great , halford 's screeching ca n't be topped on this song . 8 . beyond the realms of death-5/5-probably the best song on here . 9 . heroes end-5/5-lyrics are good ( for a hard rock song ) . a
