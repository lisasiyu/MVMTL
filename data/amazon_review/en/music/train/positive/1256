this is the stuff right here ! i bought this because i was trying expand my horizons , you know ? culturally and mentally , you know ? seriously though i was in the shop and i was having a gaze around the place and then this picture just jumps out at me , and i picked it up and it was this debussy chap and id heard about him on the bbc learning zone so i thought ; why not ? ; seriously though i dragged it home and i popped it in the old cd player and it floored me ... ... .i mean seriously this thing ... amaazing stuff..i mean todays music has nothing , nothing nothing on this stuff right here . some good tracks are : track 1 is the best . the opening flute on the track is totally chilled and cool , reminds me a bit of track 13 on ill communication by the beastie boys ... a coincidence ? ? ? the only weak track on the album is track 6 , the unfortunately titled `` childrens corner suite : golliwoggs cake walk '' the music is just dated man , just as dated as the title . overall though this is a quality album , with chills , spills and thrills . seriously though a fine effort
