not bad ... .not bad at all ! having left my gothic club mix cd at home , i decided to buy this one . what hooked me first was the live recording of `` bela lugosi 's dead '' by bauhaus , which is classic goth music . some of the bands i liked , some i did n't , but all in all this is a great cd . my favorite is `` sheryl '' on the second cd . this is a great cd for chilling , dancing , or showing the uneducated masses what goth music really is
