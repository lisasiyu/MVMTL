most incredible now i do not pretend to know everything there is to know about tears for fears ... but ... .i love this cd ! from start to finish ! it is truely a conceptual masterpiece ! i was fortunate enough to see this performed live in detroit at st. andrews music hall ... .incredible band incredible musicians ... but roland wrote it all ! he is truely a master ... and minus curt too he is still as good as ever ! its a darn shame that this did not get airplay and the concert only showed up as a small tiny ad in the corner of the local jam rag ... but the show was incredible the album has given to many a spin in my car cd player ... it was in rotation there for about an entire year and often times repeated ! references to lennon and mccartney are made and i think they are right on cue ! roland is a true pop genius ! who can really rock out too ! who ever said pop songs had to be boring eh ? just see this band perform one time if you are lucky enough ! somewhere i see he appologized to radiohead for playing the song creep but i saw him perform it with complete perfection ! the stage was extended with speakers galore and sound equipment to fill a huge venue in a small tiny club ! the lights and music and show were incredible and this cd is a great one to own ! conceptual and perfection in a pop record ! give this band more credit ! the poor website for this album set desolate for more than several years no activity ! shame its a low down dirty crying shame ... ..music has no support for the fine artists such as tears for fears ... however roland and curt you have my forever support you are both true genius 's
