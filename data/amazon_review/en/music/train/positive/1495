i love this cd i love this cd . whenever we started to watch nashville star 2 , i saw brad and heard him sing , and i have liked him since then . i bought his cd yesterday , and i love all the songs on there except one . but other than that , it 's a good cd . i love the song i miss me , when i heard him on nashville star singing that while he was playing the piano , i loved that song . but to anyone that kind of likes country music with a little bit of rock or pop or whatever , you will like this .
