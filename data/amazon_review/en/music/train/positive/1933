a great movie cast album ! i loved the movie , so i bought the cd to go with it . this is the best version of chicago ever . everyone can really sing and sing well . i love catherine zeta-jones ! she 's fantastic ! renee did well too , i was surprised by talent . richard gere too amazed me with his talent . john c. reilly is absolutely amazing doing mister cellophane . queen latifah was great as well . if you 're not sure which chicago soundtrack to buy , i would suggest this one over the broadway ones , unless you want all the songs . they cut a few songs out of the movie , but it was no major loss . this is a great soundtrack and highly recommend it to anyone !
