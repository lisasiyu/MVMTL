great trio work ! ! ! the fact no one has reviewed this title before now kind of surprises me . this records highlight some great work by monk , max roach , and art blakey ; in addition , this record marks the first time most of these tunes were ever recorded , and there are some classics on here . & quot ; trinkle , tinkle & quot ; , & quot ; blue monk & quot ; , & quot ; bemsha swing & quot ; , and & quot ; little rootie tootie & quot ; ( a lesser known but incredible tune ) are all featured on this disc along with many other wonderful songs . the particular version of & quot ; blue monk & quot ; that appears on this record represents a very memorable highmark . it clocks in at 7:36 ( the longest track on the record , most tunes are relatively short , preety much like the blue note period length wise ) and features some awesome drum work by blakey . it is really great to hear monk in a trio format , he really shines in this scenario . i would definitely recommend this title to any monk fan , or anyone wanting to start their thelonious collection . it really sets you up for monk 's & quot ; original & quot ; piano style
