classic ep from dem cleveland boyz bone 's first official release ( not counting the rare and hard to find `` b.o.n.e . enterprise '' album from 92 or 93 ) . classic , not much more to say , even though it 's only 5 songs , they 're all classics or damn good songs . with all 5 members on here , flesh was still around , you get the beginning to one of the best groups ever in rap , and in their prime , as what they did was something new and orioginal and everone loved it . production is insane , like on e.1999 , and mostly handled by the great dj uneek , who 's beats fit them so well , and some help from yella . a must have album # 3 - 10 ( classic their first big song -- great beat ) # 4 - 9 ( tight beat ) # 5 - 9.5 ( tight beat ) # 6 - 8.5 # 7 - 10 ( classic -- f/ eazy e ) krayzie -- anthony henderson -- b . 6/3/74 -- cleveland , oh bizzy -- bryon anthony mccane -- b . 9/12/76 -- b. columbus , oh ; cleveland , oh layzie -- steven howse -- b . 9/23/75 -- cleveland , oh wish -- charles scruggs -- b . 2/17/75 -- cleveland , oh flesh -- stanley vernell howse -- b . 6/10/73 -- cleveland , oh bone thugs ! ! ! ! ! check all my review
