a must for those who love lyrics this containes some of greg brown 's finest writing , it is however different from his most of his other recordings . this is a dark look at american culture without being melodramatic . i purchased this one after adding one of his finest efforts & quot ; the poet game & quot ; to my collection , and i find lyrically to be amongst his best work . highlights include 3 unique tracks & quot ; the monkey & quot ; , & quot ; one cool remove & quot ; , and & quot ; america will eat you & quot ; . other greg brown albums that i purchased after this one ( quite a few ) although they were great , did not quite rate as high on my list
