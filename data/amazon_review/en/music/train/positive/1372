an eruption of a score alan silvestri does great work when writing for action films and this really shows his unique talents . the main theme for the volcano itself is a 6 note low brass motif used frequently throughout . parts of the score are similar to eraser in instrumentation and orchestrations . one thing i was not too impressed with was the sound recording . it is a decent recording , but the overall sound is low and you have to crank up the volume to really hear it good . the best cue of them all is the thrilling `` march of the lava '' which includes all of the main elements of the score , with strong low brass rhythms , pulsating brass trills , ostinato strings , and driving , militaristic snare drums . `` team work '' and `` build a wall '' are also enjoyable tracks with snare drums and heavy brass , especially those trombone shrill sounds that elliot goldenthal has been known to use . `` main title '' is a suspenseful track that does not use the volcano theme , but instead uses a light 4 note theme that you never hear again . some romantic , dramatic music appears in the final track `` cleansing rain '' to bring the score to a close . overall , a great action score that serves both the film and your cd player well
