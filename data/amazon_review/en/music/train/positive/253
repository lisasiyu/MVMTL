murs does it again i rated this album 5 stars because it would n't let me do a 4.9 star . 3:16 was the perfect lp . this is very close . there is no one song that stands out like there was on 3:16 with , walk like a man , but still , the cd is one of the best yet . let me say this , i have 3 murs cds , the end of the beginning , 3:16 , and now murray 's revenge . this is the second best of the 3 . track 6 , dreamchaser , is definately worth putting on repeat all day . that is my favorite song on the cd . all of the tracks on here are solid . for someone trying to get a feel for murs and his style , he uses a lot of samples in his beats like kanye west , and his flow , well , hes in a league of his own . one of the best lyricists out there today and maybe of all time . he is not underground , but not big yet either . he deserves air time . his tracks are n't aimed for that like say , a nelly or little jon . all i can say is , murs deserves to be one of the top emcees in the business . and in my opinion , he is , by far . it would be interesting to see a colaboration between murs and say , mos def or the roots . all in all , buy this cd
