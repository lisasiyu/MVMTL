ack ! i like children 's music ! i 'm ashamed to say that , even as an adult , i love the music on this cd ! the kids listen to it in the car and on their little cd player . they are older ( 8 and 11 ) , so they already knew the lower times tables , but all the songs are great so we listen to them anyway and now they can remember all the numbers . ( they go up to 13 . ) it 's a long cd - definately longer than other kids music - but it has a story to it that follows along with the songs . it 's like listening to a book on tape . after years of barney and spongebob ( neither did much for my kids ' brains ) , i 'm so glad to have something that *i* can sing along with too
