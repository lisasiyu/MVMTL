5 stars for batman what more is there to say about danny elfman 's batman score ? it 's one of the most popular and well-known scores of all time . thousands of people have written their opinions of it . what more can i say ? i can say how it affected me personally . it was the first movie score i ever bought , and it was brought to my attention from my dad when we watched the film together as he said `` listen to this music in the opening credits riley '' . since then , my score collection has expanded 400 times , and my life and filmmaking career have thrived because of it . what can i say , really ? i ca n't continue to bore you with pointless anecdotes . i can say that this music is incredible and still in my top 5 of all time . it 's elfman 's best work . it 's heroic , it 's dark , it 's thematic ( i dare you not to whistle the batman theme when this cd is over ) , it 's operatic , it 's over-the-top , it 's action packed , it 's brilliant from start to finish . there is n't any wasted space on this album . elfman has a job to do , and does it with rarely elsewhere seen success . he practically created this idea of a `` dark superhero theme '' , and while the movie was a slight dissappointment , this cd continues to thrill people of any generation . what can i say ? this score is a masterpiece . end of discussion . cheers k
