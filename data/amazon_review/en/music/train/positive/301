extraordinary ! ! ! this album is sting 's prophetic masterpiece , a brilliant work of rocknroll genius with a soul , a conscience , and some of the most powerful , beautiful songs written . in this ablum sting addresses crucial political issues of our time , and timeless subjects like love , redemption , war , and more , in poetry that ranks with the very best . like others , i loved dream of the blue turtles and nothing like the sun , but sacred love truly surpasses them in its depth , maturity , passion , varied range and lyrical beauty . this is as good as rock gets , and it rarely gets close to this good . that said , `` sacred love '' may make some people uncomfortable due to the issues sting takes on here , and to the new territory he is exploring through his art . and it may go over the heads of those who do n't want rock and roll to challenge them , musically , politically or spiritually . thank god for artists like sting who follow their muse with unwavering integrity and let the chips fall where they may
