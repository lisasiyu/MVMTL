bad company is good company if you like this album , if you like the title track , it might inspire a few hard core fans to know that the original inspiration for both the name of the band , and especially the title track , is the masterpiece of a western , `` bad company '' - 1972 . the whole piano instrumental is practically lifted from the film 's soundtrack , by `` fantasticks '' harvey schmidt . the song is a very haunting one which was a bit of an enigma for me until i saw the film itself . it stars barry brown and jeff bridges . it 's worthwhile for not only western fans of every considerable imagination , but to fans of the band itself , to help make the song more meaningful , as it has for me ! ! i highly recommend them both
