from the get-go ... `` hey hey mama , said the way you move , gon na make you sweat gon na mak you groove ... '' is the opening line to an epic album if there ever was one . i can not imagine how to sit down and write a song like a led zepplin song . to create a song with the charge of `` rock and roll '' , or the lyrics to `` battle of evermore '' , to create something like these epic songs is something that beyond me ; and as for `` stairway '' i think that 's beyond any of us mortals . the popular `` stairway '' had a seemingly unreal start when one day robert plant had a pencil and paper and jimmy page was just strumming when plant described it as `` my hand just started writing out the words . i just sat there and looked at them and almost leapt out of my seat . '' the song has gone on to capture immortality in the music world and is the most frequently played song in american history , which is pretty good seeing how it was never released as an actual single . but it is not just a zepplin cd with `` stairway '' on it . it is has so much to offer in every track . i have grown up with these songs , and if you 've ever seen a ford commercial or just listened to the radio , chances are that you have had these songs in your head one way or another even if you do n't know who led zepplin is . but the one song that has always unrightfully gone in the shadows of `` stairway '' is `` when the levee breaks '' . i always personally found `` levee '' as the strongest song in zoso ; but i dare not compare two songs of their caliber . but `` levee '' brings this epic album to an extraordinary close . after every listen , i find it hard to believe that there is only eight tracks , because it sucks you into a world of enormous sound and mystery , and after you have listened to zoso whether it be the first time or if it 's been too many to count , it leaves you with a sense that you have heard something special , done by a band with a sound that is larger than life . essential recording . no exceptions
