john mayer : new to me . though john mayer is new to me , i have always liked the 'soft rock ' genre . i got drawn in by the easy rock guitar selections , ( especially 'clarity ' ) and listening to the lyrics came later . john mayer ... easy on my ears . i 'll try another cd . i think this music could grow on me .
