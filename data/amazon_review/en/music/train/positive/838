you wo n't get sick of this one we 've been listening to this one every night for 16months , and we still love it . the music is beautiful , not cloying or sweet . and maybe it 's just because we do n't understand the lyrics , but it doesnt ' get tiresome or seem condescending like so much children 's music does . not every song is a winner - there 's one that 's slightly annoying -- but basically , this is music i 'd listen to even if i did n't have twins . plus , as soon as it goes on my kids start nodding off . maybe it 's just a pavlovian response , but hey , whatever works
