rifkin going from strength to strenghth i have to admit rifkin 's version of the b minor mass , although shocked me a bit at first , managed to convert me to the one-singer-per-part theory . the point is that in bach 's sacred music human voices are used as instruments & usually pit against the instruments . so the chorus includes both the vocalists and the instrumentalists . with this in mind , rifkin 's theory works out fantastically in his musical directorship . the sounds are crisp , the balance between the vocalists and the ensemble is perfect . i got this cd after being convinced by the mass in b minor . highly recommended
