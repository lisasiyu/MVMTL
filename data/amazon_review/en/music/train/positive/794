totally greatest ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if they had an unlimited number of stars , there would n't be enough room for all mine ! this is a great cd with nearly all of my favorite toby keith songs ! they 're all super , but my favorites are i wan na talk about me , the angry american ( i love that song ! ) , beer for my horses ( love that song next ! ) , you ai n't much fun , and should 've been a cowboy . toby keith has such a great voice ! and he is n't a liberal either , might i add . ( warning : if you 're a dixie chicks fan , you 're going to hate this cd . ) great buckle on his belt on the cover picture of the cd
