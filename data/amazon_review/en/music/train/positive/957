best cob album 8 years later and this album still rules . this is by far the best children of bodom album and hatebreeder comes in second with tokyo warhearts . do n't waste your time with new bodom if you have n't heard the older stuff yet especially something wild because you will be missing out on what cob really are . deadnight warrior and touch like ( the ) angel of death amazing
