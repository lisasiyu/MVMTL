one of the few ... . for me , there have always been those bands where i like them but can only listen to a few of the songs because of the lead singers voice . this would include maroon 5 , billy talent , and clap your hands say yea . while i applaud these bands for being unique , it is hard to listen to an entire cd of it . hot hot heat is one of the only exceptions i have ever had . i can listen to their cd 's over and over and not have to stop after the 3rd or 4th track . while anything can become irritating , it takes hot hot heat quite a while to get to me . i am also not a huge fan of these new english bands like snow patrol and arctic monkeys , but yet again hot hot heat has something that just sticks with me . i recommend this cd as well as make up the breakdown . very good , upbeat songs that you will enjoy full-heartedly on a car ride home
