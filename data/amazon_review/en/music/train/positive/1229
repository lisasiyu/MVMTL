brain massage i have purchased both awakened mind system discs ( original and 2.0 ) and both are amazing . they have taken my meditations to a whole new level . they are also great for power napping or doing creative work . i feel that the awakened mind system discs are better than many of thompson 's other discs for two reasons . first , ams uses combinations of all brainwave frequencies ( beta , alpha , theta , delta ) which makes you feel both relaxed and energized , peaceful and creative , dreamy and focused , all at once . this makes ams useful for many different activities . second , they are outstanding for meditation because the music is purely ambient and abstract . many of thompson 's other discs , including the theta meditation system , use some ambience interspersed with repetitive melodies which can be quite distracting while meditating . if you 're looking for music to deepen your meditation , enhance your mental functioning , or even help you sleep , try the awakened mind system
