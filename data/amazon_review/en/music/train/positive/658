i 'm hooked as a newcomer to my chemical romance , i 've been completely blown away by this cd . that 's the good news . the bad news is that now i have to get all of their previous cds because they 're just too good . there were quite a few cds from my favorite bands that i was anticipating this fall , most of which were a total disappointment . thanks mcr , for giving us a worthy cd to listen to . flashes of queen , the killers ( hot fuss-not the new horrible cd ) , jimmy eat world , even rocky horror picture show -- i could totally envision a broadway show or movie for the theatrical quality of some songs . ca n't recommend it highly enough
