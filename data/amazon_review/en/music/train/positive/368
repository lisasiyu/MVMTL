great cd ... great memories i was very lucky to have seen cat stevens during the majikat tour in 1976 . since then i have always wanted to have a way to recapture the memories of that great concert . the dvd and this cd of the majikat tour are perfect ! outstanding sound quality , great songs passionately performed . for those who have cat 's cds , this is a wonderful addition to your collection . for those just getting into cat 's music , a great way to see and hear the `` majik '' of his music . outstanding ! ! !
