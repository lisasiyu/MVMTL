big time label debut yea , it 's all about the sellout but who cares . the first song on this album spews acidy alien blood and tears @ ss from there . paul leary is quite underrated and gibby haynes finally decided to quit being weird without a cause . but they still have a lot of weirdness and that 's where some of the filler comes in , but then i never even skip past the german guy . bloodlust said everything i needed to say but i 'll just back it up- this album is blistering space rock , like kyuss with the muffler blown off and sped up during the best parts and slowed down at times but all the while complemented by jibberish vocals . dust devil is one of my top 5 favorite songs ever written . `` got the power of an upright in his g****m hand ! bahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa . bahaaaaaaaaaaaaa !
