do n't miss this one , it rocks game on , this is good stuff ! to be honest , i wanted to like ray 's first solo stag a lot more than i did , which is why i walked , not ran to prom , but then that was before i caught the indigo girls last summer , where ray and her mandolin wowed the crowd with the anthem let it ring . it was the first time i 'd heard it and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up . the theme throughout is pretty obvious , it 's called prom , after all . but it 's also pretty obvious that you did n't have to grow up queer in small town rural america to feel like a freak . the sentiments of adolescent angst and isolation are universal , after all . but beyond waxing poetic about adolescence , there are some great cuts offering stories of love 's trainwrecks and dissatisfaction with the music industry , as well . this album is less gritty than stag and the sound is a lot more refreshing and graceful than you might expect . this outing is to ray as all that we let in is to indigo girls . the album showcases the elements we 've come to expect from ray and the indigo girls : unflinchingly honest lyrics coupled with uncompromising musicianship . those are rare commodities in today 's music industry . unleash your inner awkward teenage/freak/geek self and enjoy the prom .
