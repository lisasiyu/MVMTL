bone knows no surrender this album was everywhere around the time i was entering my senior year of high school , and for good reasons too.this album is so raw , hard edged , chilling and gritty.it has a verry dark sense of urgency , and ghetto desperation . it even has undertones of the occult like the mr quija song.also songs like no surrender ( wich has a sick chorus ! ) deal with the frustration that inner city youth has with law inforcement ( wich seems like another gang in some ghettos ) .and the song is layered with hardcore rebelious lyrics.especially from wish bone of all people when he talks about the cops arresting him and he says `` puttin ' me on my knees , tellin ' me move and i 'm dead , 'cause i 'm killin ' all your b*tches , turnin ' them blue suits red . and then i 'm comin ' to that funeral to shoot that b*tch up , because i know that 's where y'all b*tches is bound to meet up . cop killas , all up in they chest , and i know what to do with that vest , man twenty-two shots . i killa . you do n't wan na f**k with bone , nigga . and it really ai n't sh*t to pull a trigger on a copper , 'cause if i go down , some of y'all goin ' down , 'cause i 'm goin ' down poppin , so motherf**k all coppers , let me catch you slippin ' , nigga , bet i pop ya '' and the title track creepin on ah come up gives off the vibe of young inner city desperation.especialy in the first verse verse by krayzie bone when he says `` woke up this morning with the thoughts of robbin ' a bank to get rich , ai n't ate in days so it ai n't no thang to click click b***h , gim me yo s**t. '' also lazie bone 's verse echos the same sentiment `` see , i 'm sittin ' in my room , and a nigga feelin ' down , steady thinkin ' 'bout how to get paid . got ta gauge at my waist that be spellin ' out murder that 'll get a nigga locked the cage . lay my head to bed , start to thinkin ' hard , money is the cause . what can i do me for ? need to hit a lick , not a bullsh*t , but a real lick , like robbin ' a jewelery store . '' those verses pretty much sums up this album , so do the verse where bizzy bone said he took his conscience and fried them ( with weed ) after he robbed someone . but lets not forget the hit singles like thugish rugish bone wich is bone 's signiture song along with tha cross roads.and who can forget for the love of money song wich has great verses from flesh-n-bone ( whom is arguably the most overlooked memeber ) , and the late great eazy-e. flesh-n-bone- `` got ta get on the grind pop in the clip of my nine and b*tch if you slip you hit the chalk and fall in the night time got ta get mine ai n't takin no shorts or no losses hop on the phone callin ' my nigga sin at home polishin ' that mac-10 crome got ta a lick so bring yo sh*t cause once again it 's on to the dome with a fifth of burb we wig to the curb so we swerve and rolled out to pick up the triple six thug and follow the murder for robbin the dopehouse smoke jump outta me bong so high , now comin ' to slay with four grenades and a gauge i 'm a play , watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay pullin ' in the driveway , wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up bulldozed through the living room hopped out of the car and started to blow up buck , buck , and a kaboom me blew all them bodies all over the room them doomed '' bad ass verse from flesh lol , eazy-e comes hard too with this verse `` standin ' on the corner straight slangin ' rocks aw sh*t ! here comes the muthaf**kin ' cops ! so i dash , i ducks , and i hides behind a tree makin ' sure the muthaf**kas do n't see me now my fat sack of rocks hell yeah i stuffed 'em police on my draws , i had to pause and yeah , it 's still muthaf**k 'em now my game is tight , tight as f**k is my game easy muthaf**kin e or eric wright it 's all the same now niggas might trip on how i stash my grip i got ta have it b*tch for the love of this sh*t muthaf**ka ! ! '' what a great verse from eazy-e , and its one of my favorites by him . i also love the bass heavy down for my thang and i like how the song fades out with bone harmonizing the chorus as the song fades out.the intro with the quintet harmonizing along with down for my thang made me understand the relevence of the term harmony in the groups name.and after hearing the aformentioned 2 songs i kinda got the style and the jist of the group . and in turn i could n't wait for their follow up.because their sound was so melodic/smooth yet hard edged and hard as nails.it was unlike anything i heard before.i will admit though i too wonder how good this album would have been if it was a full lp instead of a ep.but `` as is '' its a great rap album that gives you only a taste of whats to come from this underrated but legendary group
