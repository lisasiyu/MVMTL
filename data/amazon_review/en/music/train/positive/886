i love ricky 's country but his bluesgrass rules this is one of those bluegrass albums . you cant be without , i love everysong from this album not a bad one at all . bluegrass albums are my favorites by him i was raised on bluegrass music . and i know alot about ricky skaggs , from my dad who is also a mandolin picker and singer and he had the great joy of meeting ricky 's sister at a studio once ... would love to meet the man himself someday if your a bluesgrass or a rickyskaggs fan then get the album you 'll be glad you did
