if you saw dig ! , buy this album with confidence . i heard about these guys from that movie , dig ! , and i did n't know what to expect . turns out , they 're amazing . there 's no comparison to the dandy warhols , none . why they thought they were in competition with a hack band with a few hooks is beyond me . these guys are the real deal . if it was n't for their lead singer making a jerk of himself and screwing up record deals ( which is a storyline that you wo n't understand once you hear the thoughtful lyrics ) , these guys would be widely known as one of the best bands in the world . they sound like a throwback from the 60 's , but slightly updated . the music is varied and intelligent as anything you 've heard . i guess the rolling stones might be an apt comparison , but there 's something more raw about this band . look , if you were on the fence , just buy this , you wo n't be disappointed
