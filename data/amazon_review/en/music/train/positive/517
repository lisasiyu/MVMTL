easily the best beastie boys album ... hey , what 's up ? this is my first review . at first i did n't feel it was necessary ; paul 's boutique already has five stars , and deserves every one of them . still , the quality of this record compelled me to express my thoughts on it , too . this album is near perfect . the only track i feel is weak ( and it 's not even that bad ) is egg man . i did n't dig it at first ... but it grew on me , so i 'll give it a listen , now , especially for the sampling ( as mentioned by another reviewer ) . every single track on the album is linked . i think this adds alot to it , because it 's like a non-stop track . very enjoyable . if you 're looking for a great hip-hop album or want to get into the beastie boys , definitely cop this album . solid gold hits is n't great , and the anthology is n't worth it . all beastie boys albums pale in comparison to this sucker . get paul 's boutique
