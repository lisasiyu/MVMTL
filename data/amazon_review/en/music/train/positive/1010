best female singer of the past 40 years . pat benatar is a natural . this compilation has been thoroughly reviewed , so i will focus on four very different songs . her phenomenal voice comes piercing through on `` heartbreaker , '' a jaunty tune with catchy lyrics & intense energy . in `` i need a lover , '' she deciphers a females self-awareness that is rarely heard from in this genre of music . `` we live for love , '' is a smooth sensual song that appeals to the romantic in all of us . this one is good for dancing or driving on a breezy autumn day . `` hell is for children , '' a deeply disturbing tune with its descriptions of child abuse . it brings out any decent persons protectiveness towards kids everywhere . lastly , in `` love is a battlefield . '' she takes the listener on a roller coaster ride of emotions . the honest lyrics & her perfect delivery makes one ponder the title . all of her fans will be pleased with this entire compilation . it has no flaws
