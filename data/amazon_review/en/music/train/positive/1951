pure and perfect having traveled many miles going to bluegrass festivals in texas , oklahoma , louisiana , i have heard some great music . and the wonderful thing about the festivals , it does n't have to be the headline stars that are so good , sometimes the & quot ; parking lot pickers & quot ; are just as enjoyable . but back to this , i love ricky skaggs , i love him for continuing to follow a narrow path that he has chosen in the music business . that takes a lot of guts , especially when all the glory goes to the hat acts
