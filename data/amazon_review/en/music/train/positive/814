i love it and ca n't stop repeating it ( on my cd player ) i was lucky enough to see this show three times : twice on the northwestern university campus ( original musical title was `` a long gay book , '' ) and a third time at the museum of contemporary art in chicago . this show is stunning . i found myself humming melodies from the show - even though i had n't seen it in over a year ( and did n't own the recording ) ! the music and lyrics have a way of staying with you . this is a real work of art - poetry and song , based on the work of gertrude stein . if you 're a fan of musicals with soul , wit , and class , then you 'll love this . the voices of christine mild and jenny powers ( little women ) are extraordinary and cindy gold 's narration is engaging and uniquely powerful . combine these talents with that of frank galati ( tony award winner ... director , adapted script ) and stephen flaherty ( ragtime , etc . ) and you have one amazing musical . highly recommended ! ! !
