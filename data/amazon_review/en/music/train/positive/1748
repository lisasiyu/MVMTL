excellent old school awb is a very underrated band . their talent is definitely for the mature r & b fan who enjoys funk . if this description fits you , you will love pickin ' up the pieces . there were more great songs on the cd than i expected . `` cloudy '' and `` a love of your own '' were the slow jams when i was in high school . i am so glad to now have this cd in my collection .
