absolute garbage tipsy and hood hop were decent but the rest of this crap is flat out horrible . this was one of the worst rap albums of last year and hopefully this dumbass wo n't make another album or will step his game up . xxx was n't bad but this dude still is a horrible rapper and i do n't recommend buying this trash at all . if you want a good mix of party and gangsta songs get 50 cent 's massacre album instead or even ja rule 's r.u.l.e . those are n't classics but they are much better than this garbage
