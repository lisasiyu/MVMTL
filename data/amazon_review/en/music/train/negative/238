fnak - this is bad . i liked the first album and i wo n't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre , but some things i have learned : 1 ) do n't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2 ) maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3 ) drop the `` my life sucks '' and `` everyone hates me '' tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4 ) i do n't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5 ) if every background singer has a better voice , perhaps your are done anyone want to buy a used cd
