for at least trying but they tried way to hard to supercede front page news and to make it more successful . failed at both attempts ! this was a big slump period for the band at this point in time . in fact most of these songs when performed live , had the intense fire , these studio versions lacked . 'way of the world ' scorched everytime i heard it live , but on no smoke without fire , well it was a smouldering flicker . this was one of their biggest letdowns with laurie wisefield on second guitar . the live tracks included here ( lorelei ) are nice but are hardly indicative of what 'couldve been ' , if that energy was put to better use for this project
