missing ! i 'm a big sytx fan and have most of their studio albums so this collection is n't of interest to me . but the omissions of do n't let it end , why me and love at first sight prompted me to give this a poor rating . i guess anthology does n't technically mean best of or greatest hits , but i hate when collections are put together and charting singles are left out . i would recommend getting greatest hits and greatest hits part 2 if you 're just looking for a styx collection
