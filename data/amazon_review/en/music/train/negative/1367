why no new songs ? i give this cd one star , not because it is n't good , but , because it is the same stuff they have already sold once . i am a big blind melon fan . i was fortunate to see them live 3 times and they were great , but , when you can download songs like mother earth , whoa god , tickled pink , and rebirth . i have to wonder why they would release an album that is all old stuff . the only people interested in this album would be melon fans . evident by how poorly nico did in sales , this is very disappointing , it seems they are broke and are trying to rip the true fans off . there is nothing new , so do yourself a favor and just bust out your old cd 's and play them , do n't buy this , unless you do n't own the albums . the surviving members should be ashamed of themselves
