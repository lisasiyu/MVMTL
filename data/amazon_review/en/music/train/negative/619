haha ! a modern minstrel show indeed ... wow so in history class they told me because of its racist themes and such that minstrel shows are long gone but they obviously have n't heard this trash . sheesh , where do i even begin ? you thought fiddy was bad ? how about chingy ? lil jon ? nope , they 're not nearly as bad as these wastes of flesh . these guys are a disgrace to the black race , aaron mcgruder is totally right ( creator of the boondocks ) if martin luther king jr. did somehow get resurrected he would definitely scoff at the state of black america , perhaps it was a tad exaggerated but it still made an excellent point . afterall it was chris rock that said , `` there are black people and there 's n***ers ! '' then everyone in the audience laughed their *sses off because it 's true . unfortunately these guys fall in the latter group . do n't give me that rubbish on how it 's just the music , no way folks , this goes far beyond the music itself . this is a reflection of the sad state our society is in . ok people you want to talk about the actual music ? we shall then , but these cliched annoying 'beats ' lack so much substance that i 'm just wasting text space talking about the 'music ' . the lyrics ? they bring new meaning to the word stupid . so there you have it , this logic pretty much applies to all their cds and anyone else like them ( the aforementioned rap degenerates ) they really take the cake for retards of the decade when we talk about `` i love the '00s '' in 10 years . by the way check out the boondocks , it 's a great comic-turned-cartoon , it 's very fresh and unique
