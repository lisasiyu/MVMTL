in my humble opinion - guys ... it 's not that good . i have the album on my computer , and i gave it a few listens , but ... it has no substance . it 's not interesting or anything new . it 's catchy . and irritating , after more than a song or two . that 's all ( `` bandages '' is enjoyable once in a while , i will concede ) . if you 're looking for catchy and poppy ( and there 's nothing wrong with that ) , then buy it . if you want something new and original - do n't . and if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like the faint , the bravery , or le tigre .
