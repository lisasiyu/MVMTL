weak ... especially pb on the guitar wow ... i thought this album was going to be `` too damn hot '' ... it is `` so damn not '' that it 's frightening . the tunes are weak , the doctor 's playing is okay but not inspired and bernstein 's guitar playing is beyond lame . i 've seen bernstein at a club uptown and he was decent at best ( better comping , not a great soloist ) but this album does n't display the best of either of these wonderful musicians ' capabilities
