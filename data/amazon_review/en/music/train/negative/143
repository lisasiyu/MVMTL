much overrated when i first bought this cd i really liked it , but unlike most other cd 's it sounded worse with time . after 2-3 months it was just sitting in my drawer and i found myself skipping stations on the radio when they played the killers . after seeing them live at the virgin festival this weekend i know they are totally phony , not only is their cd bland but they are the worst live band ever . do yourself a favor save your money on this one
