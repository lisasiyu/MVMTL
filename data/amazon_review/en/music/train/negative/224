so-so cd ... .terrible band as a well-educated rock music , especially emo-punk , person , i was sickened every time i tried to listen to this cd all the way through.why ? it 's definitely one of the less-than-great emo albums ever ( not completely horrible , though ) and the fact that this band is led by a singer who should n't be bragging about his `` musical genius '' when he should first realize how disgusting his voice sounds compared to most other emo singers , is n't sweetening the deal.when i bought this album , it had a sticker on it that read : '' if you like taking back sunday , brand new and the used , you 'll love matchbook romance ! `` i should have known how desperate they were when i read that.but more disturbing is the fact that they dared compared themselves to taking back sunday ? tbs is actually an emo band that does n't sound recicled.and brand new ? have they heard deja entendu ? that album is not only the best emo album , but definitely one of the best albums of all time-in any genre
