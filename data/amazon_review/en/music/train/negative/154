chopin or lang lang ? just listening to few extracts of chopin sonata on amazon.com made it clear to me - i do n't want to hear the rest . let 's take the scherzo ( 2nd movement ) , for example . lang lang plays the middle episode not just `` a little slow '' but at least twice as slow . whereas if you look in the score you 'll see a strikingly different picture - chopin ( the composer ! ) asked for no tempo change , he never canceled molto vivace . unfortunately , it is very common when a performer changes things here and there , so it sounds so called original and `` deep '' , rather then trying to read attentively the composer 's code , understand and make sense of it . i trust chopin 's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing beauty .
