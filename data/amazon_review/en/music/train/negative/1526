judy garland in hollywood i 'm a big judy garland fan , but found this cd lacking . her voice did n't have that extra force she always puts into her songs . some of them sounded like a bad imitation or she recorded it in her sleep . it says & quot ; original soundtrack & quot ; . maybe it needs to be re-mastered . it certainly wo n't be my favorite
