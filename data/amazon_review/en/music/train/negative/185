long fall from longfall there are a couple ok tracks on this disc but this is far and away not the same lost trailers that put out some of my favorite music of the past few years . gone are the well crafted , story like lyrics and any sound of southern rock . those great stories ( longfall , pontchartrain , love & war , west end , dougherty county , under fm waves and so many more ) and great music ( see above as well as red sun , sitting on top of the world and down in the valley ) have been replaced by gravy , dixie boy special & i 'm a country man and the same old radio friendly country sound you can hear from anyone . the sad irony in this are the lyrics to under fm waves ( from new age cowboy ) and how they talk about how much great music resides off radio -- and look at what has happened : songs to created to make it on radio ( which granted , should make them big ) . try their other 3 available cd 's ( story of the new age cowboy , trailer trash and welcome to the woods ) . they have some other very hard to find music out there but these 3 should be available ( trailer trash is a mix of songs from rock band , songs that ended up on welcome , etc ) . p.s . to the last review -- ryder lee is the lead vocalist . geoffrey stokes neilson is the guitarist and lead songwriter .
