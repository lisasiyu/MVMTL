cheap sounding if you like your music reproduced with a synthesizer and 80 's production quality , than this cd is for you . other than that , you have to ask yourself why it was $ 10 at walmart as stated by a previous review . ( hint : not because it was a hidden gem ) i could n't give this less than a star because of the song selection . that is all this cd has going for it . so read the songs , enjoy it for what it is worth , move along and buy another comp that closely resembles this . ( all in that order ) sorry drew , now go back to the drawing board
