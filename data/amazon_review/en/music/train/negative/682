you 're just what i need anyone looking for the song `` you 're just what i need '' featured in this movie can find the song on the cd `` more than a lot '' by rufus king . it 's a very hard-to-find cd because the band did n't have a label but i found it on cdbaby.com . do n't know if it 's still for sale there or not but the cd is worth it
