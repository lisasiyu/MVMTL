i really want a constantine cd ... not this . i did n't buy the cd ... i could n't make it past the samples . i loved constantine on idol . i did n't think he was the best there , but i thought he was near the top . performance wise though , this guy can perform on stage ... i just love him . this music though , not impressed . i understand why he would want to promote his original band , but he really needs to give it up and go out on his own . he did so good on idol and had so many fans . granted , i 'm sure some will buy this cd just because they are a fan . and i 'm sure that there are some that will love it . i 'm not one of them though . i really wanted to like it , but i just ca n't . that said though , i would really like to see the constantine from idol make his own cd . now that one i would buy
