guys talking over a beat , great ! this is a joke right ? ! i honestly thought this group was a hiphop parody group at first because i figured nobody could be that bad on purpose . these british rappers are hiliarous , they basically talk over a beat and it does n't even rhyme half the time . i got given this cd for free and i still want some money back
