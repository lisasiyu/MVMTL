imagine a world without this band 's boredom ... .. believe it or not , i had actually expected to hate this because it just does n't suit me for the good kind of music . it sounds just the way i thought it would sound : crappy . it is n't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me . it is just too calm . { and now you probably think i 'm a hypocrite because i like enya } . at least enya does n't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music . not my style .
