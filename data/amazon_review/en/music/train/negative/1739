an album in the same style as this left feels right does n't crack it with original songs i was very disappointed with the latest album from bon jovi , a band that has put out numerous exceptionally high quality albums throughout their career . obviously no one still expects them to put out albums today that set the scene of what is cool music wise , that they did back in the 80 's and early 90 's with the classics such as slippery when wet , new jersey and keep the faith . obviously like everyone else from that era they rely on the next generation to tell them what is the latest rage music wise but this album music wise does n't seem to fall into the latest style or ignore the latest trends and maintain their classic sound . the album is like a continuation sound wise of their previous album this left feels right , which was a greatest hits album rerecorded with their classic songs in a way that emphasised their lyrics . that was great for the classics songs hearing them in a new way but this style for a whole album of new songs really does n't do anything for me or anyone else i 've come across . have a nice day is catchy and fast enough to be a great live song and it 'll be around for a while if not forever but i do n't think in five years time any other song from this album , like with other mediocre albums like crush and bounce will be played on the radio or at a bon jovi concert ( and make sure you go to one of these before you or they die as they are the best live band one earth ) . i hope that the guys have a few more good albums left in them but this certainly is not an indication that they do .
