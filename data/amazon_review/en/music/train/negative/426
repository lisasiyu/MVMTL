going , going , gone ... and forgotten . raw and ragged . cliche-ridden . i consider albums like `` highway 61 revisited '' , `` bringing it all back home '' , `` blonde on blonde '' , `` blood on the tracks '' and hell , even `` the freewheelin ' bob dylan '' as worthy of five stars . sorry , but this is just not in the same class or anywhere near those masterpieces . those albums are deemed 'classics ' for a reason . that said , i 'm not at all a fan of the band or many of dylan 's love songs so please take these things into consideration when contemplating the worth of both this review and this album
