good or bad ? your choice , really ... being an avid enthusiast of the drum n ' bass & quot ; scene , & quot ; as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is , in listening to this cd i feel this is not a strong representation of the genre . this could very well be personal , ( so you headz chill ) but this type of jazzy , tech-step like , a cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled with..well ... & quot ; filler. & quot ; i realize that during 1998 this was where it was at for grooverider . he was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts . this album has a few choice cuts , and his production skills are commendable , but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre is definately an abuse of power . the loungy progressions are worn thick , and lacking any true creativity deep down . this album comes nowhere near stuff on the & quot ; prototype years & quot ; ep which was showcasing the fine talents of heavy hitters dillinja , ed rush , fierce , lemon d , optical , and boymerang , to name a few . it goes without saying that grooverider has been one of the most respected and talented dj 's , probably getting all of these afforementioned producers their starts . a big name gets alot of support and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom . no one would dare defy that grooverider 's attempt at making d n b is off key , but let 's not give in to someone 's production skills because they are graciously empowered in the scene like a king . purveyor 's of fine drum n ' bass can find sanctuary elsewhere . stick with your records for the best
