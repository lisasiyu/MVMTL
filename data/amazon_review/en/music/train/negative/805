not worth it this is definitely one of the worst cd purchases i 've made . the cd is poorly organized , and most of the music is n't as good as one would think . the songs that are worth listening to though , are : disc 1 : 8 . halifax - `` sydney '' 11 . say anything - `` woe '' 15 . i can make a mess like nobody 's business - `` the best happiness money can buy '' 56 . patent pending - `` los angeles '' disc 2 : 1 . hellogoodbye - `` homewrecker '' 5 . jack 's mannequin - `` kill the messenger '' 8 . matchbook romance - `` my eyes burn '' other than that , this is really a minimal value cd , in my opinion
