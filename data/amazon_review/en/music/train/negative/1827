what a disappointment i do n't understand all the raves for this cd , i was so disappointed when i listened to it . i 've always liked john barry 's film scores but in this re-recording all life has been drained out of the music . where 's all the emotion , the excitement and pathos ? instead , every track sounds the same -- they 're all filled with a melancholic boredom . give me any of the original soundtracks over this & quot ; easy-listening & quot ; interpretation
