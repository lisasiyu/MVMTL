more reverb than a def leppard album ! i like slayer . i really do . this is one of the fastest , heaviest metal bands in existance , but i could never get in to their early albums , especially hell awaits . i tend to prefer their later albums like reign in blood , because they were much better produced . rick rubin made those records sound the way a speed metal record should , with everything up front in your face . reign in blood had the most `` in your face '' sound of any record i 've ever heard . hell awaits on the other hand is just soaked in so much reverb that it sometimes reminds me of `` pyromania '' by def leppard ! this is one of the heaviest bands in existance . how is a speed metal band supposed to sound heavy when their producer insists on making them in to the speed metal version of def leppard ? thrash is supposed to be `` in your face '' . there 's no place for reverb on a speed metal record . you want to hear heavilly reverbed production , than go buy a def leppard cd ! i myself prefer a more aggressive style that fits this kind of music . down with reverb ! i hate reverb ! layers of reverb have no place in speed metal
