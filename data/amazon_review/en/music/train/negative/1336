i lied , this is definately a 4 star album authors note : for some reason i rated this album a 2 out of 5 stars , although i thought i had rated a bit higher , and since i ca n't change that `` star-rating '' now , i will say this : this album is good , borderline great at times , and shows at a lot of promise . it 's hyper and rough around the edges , but a lot of fun . it contains a handful good songs , and few great ones , here are a few of the standouts : `` bicycle , bicycle , you are my bicycle '' , and `` adventure '' , are both good ... although i feel that `` we will vacation , you can be my parasol '' is a better song , and had they played around with it a bit more in the studio , it could have `` the single '' , but it 's a great song either way . the next portion i would like to direct to members byop : whatever muse you guys followed to come up with `` october , first account '' , keep following it , and if need be , hold it hostage at gunpoint . that song is `` the single '' of the entire album , and if you can recapture that same mojo a bit more on the next album , the skies the limit .
