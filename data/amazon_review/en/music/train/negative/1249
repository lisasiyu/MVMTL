ny dj 's ca n't all be great once again ultra records has put it 's trust into new york dj 's , and the results are not pleasing . disc one mixed by vic latino from nyc is good enough for radio ( stick to ktu ) but not for the higher standards set by the uk dj 's who are always well ahead of the game . bad song choices and even worse mix choices make disc 1 a failure . disc 2 mixed by the riddler , also a nyc dj is a vast improvment and he should be commended on his effort and this just proves not all dj 's from nyc are all bad . better song choices here more on the trance side but with enough vocal power to keep you moving . this disc will be the one you play the most . but for the money it 's still a deal . i 've liked ultra 's trance cd 's alot better , but if your looking for real club music stay with a proven winner and check out ministry of sound , you ca n't go wrong with any of their cd '
