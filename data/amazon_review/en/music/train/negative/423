not what i was hoping for , but not horrible well , i was also disappointed that certain songs were missing on the soundtrack . i do not however think it 's fair to say this is a cd only for blacks because it 's all rap ! that 's ridiculous . but , i 'll overlook that naive comment & say , even for those of you who do like hip hop , there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing . i loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one ( let 'em fight ? ) . that 's the song i wanted the soundtrack for & i was so disappointed . as for those of you interested in that lynyrd skynyrd song playing during the car chase , it 's called , `` saturday night special . '' the soundtrack was n't bad , just a disappointment . to see all of the songs that were played in the movie , visit : http : //www.imdb.com/title/tt0398165/soundtrack
