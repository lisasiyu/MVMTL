save your money this is a terrible album . cocorosie is one of those bands that are fun to throw in with a bunch of other bands in a music related conversation to make your taste and knowledge of hip and independent music sound that much bigger than it really is . the cover artwork is pretty funny and cocorosie is a cool name , the only problem is that they make music that sounds like it does and they charge people money to listen to it .
