not her best i listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong . her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce . billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra . fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang . you make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless . the one good thing about billie is that there is alot of her music to chosse from before you buy this
