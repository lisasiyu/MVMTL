laughable ... after the nu-metal ship sunk , dez got rid of coal chamber ( another terrible band ) and started this awful band to keep the paychecks flowing . in doing this , he 's making us think he 's a death/black metal fan , but i know that he 's nothing more than a run-of-the-mill trend-hopper . now to the music , it 's lame , watered-down `` metal '' made for the kids who listen to trivium , slipknot , and korn . listen to kreator 's `` enemy of god '' for a way better metal album from 2005
