pretty weak stuff i have to admit that i had not really listened to mika before i saw him in concert in stockholm . he does what he does reasonably well for this genre . good falsetto voice although it gets a bit loud and annoying during the show . here is what made me lose all respect for this artist . during his show in stockholm he only played for 60 minutes , including an encore . i am sorry , but no artist worth anything would walk away only playing 60 minutes . overall i would say ok voice , pretty weak songwriting , and pathetic live show . i lost what little respect i gained for mika during the first few songs . weak , weak , weak .
