g & d gone pop = ( wow ! what a horrible album ! its tracks are filled with a bunch of predictable outcomes and very cheesy vocals . the only two tunes that i have found to be interesting were eleven and sydney . eleven is actually my favourite tune . gabriel & dresden had the potential as they made some quality productions - although most of them were a bit too commercial , but still quility - throughout years 2002-2004 . then they released the awesome , their best in my opinion , track arcadia . after the release of arcadia , i just thought it could n't get better than this - an awsome production without any of that cheesiness that you would find in their earlier works . but the reality was that from that point on it just went downhill for these two . and this album just proves it . all of these tracks are well done and finished , but too finished and too uncreative . it actually did n't surprise me after hearing their essential mix back in spring . basically they have great production skills but absolutely no ideas . i would recommend just buying track eleven on 12 '' or mp3
