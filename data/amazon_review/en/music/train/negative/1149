do n't waste your money the problem with this cd is their is another cd called & quot ; the singles & quot ; which contains all these songs and more . the only song left out is & quot ; wind beneath my wings. & quot ; true sheena 's version is far superior to bette midler 's it is better to buy the cd & quot ; machinery & quot ; from where the song was pulled
