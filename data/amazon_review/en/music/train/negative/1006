warning : mislabeled as a karaoke title . this is a sing along . conventional karaoke titles use cd-g formats . this should have been labelled a disney sing along album . printed lyrics do not make a karaoke cd which is entirely misleading the general consumer . fortunately the variety of songs and quality of the recordings still give a strong entertainment value for your child . if you want the variety of disney music , here it is . if you want a sing along album , especially if you do not have a karaoke player , you have your wish . if you want a karaoke format , look elsewhere .
