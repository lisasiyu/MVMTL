i 'm disappointed maybe i expect too much from an old wurlitzer but i do n't remember the snare drums being so distorted in real life as they are on this cd . almost like there was some kind of a frequency clipper on the microphone ( s ) or maybe they were in the wrong place and were overloaded . whatever the reason i think this cd needs to be remastered ( or something ) to fix this problem before it can be truly enjoyable . i note also a similar comment about the volume ii cd
