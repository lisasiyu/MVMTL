i feel embarassed for steve albini when i listen to this . this is one of the worst , not to mention most downright annoying albums to come out in recent memory . anyone who claims to like this overrated insult to underground music is just trying to sound cool , and failing miserably . in fact , i 'll go out on a limb here and say that anyone who says they like this album has n't even heard the damn thing , and probably just saw it on a pitchfork list somewhere - and if pitchfork says it 's good , it must be good , right ? wrong . this album sucks . it 's sad to see people so desperate for indie cred ( which , i hate to break it to you , is n't that cool either ) that they degrade themselves by publicly admitting they enjoy this album . however , i would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys hearing steve albini ramble on like a douche , with mediocore music being played in the background . everyone else , save yourself the trouble and the $ 10
