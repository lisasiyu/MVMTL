seriously , what happened to these guys these guys have n't put a good album out since floored . lemonade and brownies is a great metal album and by far their best . once & quot ; fly & quot ; was a hit , it ruined their sound and they completely sold their souls and sold out their old fans . when i heard the first single off this album , i almost cried to see how low this band has gone . i ca n't believe mark mcgrath was in that angel 's song for sevendust . now there 's a metal band that still puts out good hard albums
