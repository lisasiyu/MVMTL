i did not like it i was not feeling this album at all which is strange because i like mac dre and dubee quite a bit . i was not feeling the tracks . it was too funk oriented , with some dumb sounding tracks . it was not the smooth type of production that i expected to hear coming out of vallejo . a big disappointment
