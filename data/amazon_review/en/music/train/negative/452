omarion 's cheaper , less talented alternative wow , i never thought i would 've found an r & b album worse than omarion 's debut until i finished listening to this album 's samples on amazon . `` naked '' , marques houston 's spohomore effort , is undoubtedly the worst r & b album i have ever heard in a long while . i apoligize for sounding harsh , but think about it . where 's the talent ? where 's the skill ? what about the heart & soul ? where 's the musical ambition ? what about meaningful lyrics & nice beats ? where 's his dignity ? where 's hist artistic growth ? i 'm betting he threw all that & so much more out the window along with his tacky clothes . marques , take this into account ... you 're not usher and you never will be , so stop trying ! i honestly tried really hard to force myself to like his song `` all because of you '' , but i just could n't convince myself to do it . there 's not a single song on this entire album that has any true emotional depth . his other singles , `` naked '' & `` sex wit you '' are absolutely pathetic attempts at explicit sexuality , with egomaniacle , ridicuously retarded videos to boot . as if the cheesy , sexual come-ons & emotionally devoid ballads were hard enough to bare , you have miserable club tunes to complain about here & there . marques houston is a perfect example of why r & b goes downhills nowadays . anybody with a slight fraction of a brain would be aware that he has no talent , and relies on his ugly mug & flabby gut to seek the attention of ditsy tween girls worldwide . skip this album at all costs ( and i mean that literally )
