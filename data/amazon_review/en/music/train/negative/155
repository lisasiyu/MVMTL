hello people this is a mixtape not an album ! i dont see how anybody can call this an album . this is a mixtape . lil wayne basically freestyled through the whole album ! the beats are bland and only a few of wayne 's freestyles are tight . standout freestyles : the mobb , money on my mind , fireman , oh no , hit em'up and im a dboy . filler freestyles : shooter , receipt , grown man , feel me , hustler music , mo fire etc . lock and load is a boring track and kurupt is whispering in the hook ( wtf ! ) . its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s -- - . the majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north . lil wayne 's best albums are lights out and the carter . lil wayne at his worst : the block is hot , 500 degrees and the carter 2 .
