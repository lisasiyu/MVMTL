not great , not bad i listened to cd and i dont know how to explain this cd . i cant really explain to well i guess , but i 'll try . the problem i had was the swearing . i usually dont have a problem with swearing , but the way this band did it ruined the cd . it seemed like every other word in the songs are f $ % * . it sounded like they tried to damn hard to impress the youth by doing this . the cd held nothing speical at all , not what i really wanted to hear in a metal cd . if you want really inspiring music go and listen to a hatebreed cd . this cd is alright , but the swearing was so stupid and out of place . ha ! thats what i meant to say , the swearing just seemed random and out of place . thats what the problem with the cd was . just add it here and there , not every other word . probably would have been a better cd that way . to fans fo throwdown , please do complain . everyone has an opinion and that is mine .
