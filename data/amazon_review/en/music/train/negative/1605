hardly representative of the 90s has anyone else noticed that there isnt a single nirvana song ? of all of the bands of the 90s , nirvana was undoubtedly one of the more luminary bands . and yet they appear nowhere on this compilation . instead , we are treated to the worst of the consumerist , disposable pop trash the 90s had to offer . a retrospective album should do more to cover the diverse styles of music that were prevalent at this time , but this album falls short in every aspect .
