uh - seriously , can you go away ? okay , so now you 're on two hit songs . well done , i-20 . but that does n't mean you should be a hit yourself . to all the people that went out and bought this , i 'm sorry but i really ca n't see why . you can be a talented rapper . get an interesting voice with lots of expression , put in some good backings and you 've got no problems . but i-20 fails here on both counts . does anyone else think that he 's got the most annoying voice ? that low drone is just a complete turn off and he does n't even bother to vary his voice . maybe a good beat could have saved him , but there 's no salvation here , either . in fact , the key tracks are the ones where he collaborates with someone else and lets them have the centre of attention , only because we do n't have to hear his voice - this makes backstage & hey shawty bearable . but , really , i-20 should take a good look at himself before he decides to make another album . feature on other people 's songs , sure , then you can still be a star . but at least then we wo n't have to listen to fifty mintues of you
