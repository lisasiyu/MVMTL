missed opportunity ! a missed opportunity by bruce springsteen to produce live box-set two . unlike `` live 1975 to 1985 '' , he could of balanced the ledger from his first live project with a much better selection from the final ten shows at madison square garden 2000 . at this stage in his career it would not be important to master a selection of live takes from different dates and venues . instead , a vast repertoire of his music was performed at this one venue , according to the set lists of these ten shows . if bruce saw this and implemented it , this could have set the record straight with his fans and the bootleggers . a fan 's dream i suppose . otherwise a poor live cd capitalizing on the margin of time it took to release the much better dvd product . it is obvious that some of the most important live songs were included as an afterthought . i have no problem with bruce 's politics but i am disappointed with the quality of his recent releases on cd . in the end , this is what matters most to me as a fan of the boss .
