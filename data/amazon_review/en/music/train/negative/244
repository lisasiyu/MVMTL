another round of this ... nelly 's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one . the song hot in herre was a decent lead off single , so i thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit . boy was i wrong . more singing and this time with kelly rowland from destiny 's child on the song delimma and a song with justin timberlake . now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking beanie siegel 's roc tha mic ( remix ) and puts it on his cd , not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend krs-one . another track worth listening to is # 1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to . everything else , just a big no no . once again he has appealed himself to the people who hardly listening to rap , because i even hear that song with kelly rowland on oldies radio stations . this right here has got to stop , because i had enough of it .
