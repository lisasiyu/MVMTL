can i get my money back this is at best a rip-off of the tremendous talent we have come to know as shinia twain , country singer . this music may have done well and good in it 's time , but shinia is a bonafide country queen now and for anyone to use her name and status to capitalize on anything but the country music star we have all come to know and love is a rip-off . yes , this album is a rip-off as is . were it presented as shinia ( eileen ) , circa 1990 , `` disco queen '' it would have been a fairer description of this music then what it was . can i get my money back ? 3of4 el centro , ca
