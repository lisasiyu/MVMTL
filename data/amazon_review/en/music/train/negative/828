over produced wow . i 've never really been a fan but i respect their lead guitarist.he 's done alot of great work ... but damn this cd ai n't even catchy one bit . you can hear the pitch fixer on benji 's voice throughout the entire cd ... it 's bad . like realllllly bad . and it 's way over produced..
