this single cost britney 's knee ! there 's nothing outrageous about the title song - it 's a lame , mind-numbing piece of crap compared to many other songs found on the `` in the zone '' album : imagine `` breathe on me '' , `` touch of my hand '' or `` shadow '' on constant radio play or running on mtv . and no , we 're not apparently going to have that because britney 's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it , like we know ended up in britney 's injury . for nothing . fortunately for this single , it 's got the already legendary `` toxic '' and a marvelous vocal mix version of `` everytime '' - another star for that .
