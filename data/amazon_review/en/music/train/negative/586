well , at least it 's better than brave new world ! ! ! when i listened to this cd i actually expected to hear gloria estafan singing on some of these songs . some of them seem like they were written for her . wild card has a few good songs on it . the title track is okay . moonlight and king of hearts are better . the last good cd by the rippington 's was weekend in monaco . changes in personnel , locations , and labels have n't proved to be too good for russ 's music . he 's made his money and can experiment with various ideas . wild card is loser in my opinion , but at least it 's better than brave new world
