garbage ! another great player selling out to sell more . seems like another outbreak of the kenny bug . i 'm sure any jazz aficianado would agree with me when i say that gerald albright is a much more comprehensive player than this album suggets . check out the 'live at birdland west ' album for a taste of what mr. albright is really about .
