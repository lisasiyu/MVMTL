very disappointing it feels as though she has lost her energy , she has become a distant memory of what she used to be with mecano . still a sweet voice , the songs chosen for this cd are mediocre . her first solo cd was good , this was is not . the music just does n't click , the art in the sleeve does n't click either , maybe she needs new composers , a different producer . the pink floyd track is regrettable , she should not sing in english , she can sing in spanish and french but i would suggest her to refrain from doing it in english . maybe the cano brothers should compose her new material , maybe mecano should make a comeback ...
