one of the worst products of current folk 'revivalism' and folk revivalism is what it is , folks ; i 'll label it even if the populists fume at me because i know of more than 5 genres . meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the fairport convention , pentangle , and above all shirely collins . he even did an album of `` covers '' of shirley collins ' arrangements of british traditionals , a ridiculous concept if i ever heard of one . why cover another singer 's versions of traditional songs ? this idiocy should evince meloy 's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of british folk music , and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition . with no prosodic skill , he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as shirley collins ' repertoire . evidently meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a walter scott , s.t.c . or john keats , but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an american desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie . the wistfulness and romantic nostalgia of meloy 's work come off as trite and calculated for npr yuppies . moreover , his vocal range consists entirely of yelp , melancholy warble and nasal whine -- this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold . i 'll admit the band is at least competent , but do yourself a favor : buy comus ' `` first utterance , '' the incredible string band 's `` the hangman 's beautiful daughter '' or shirley collins ' `` no roses '' instead
