garbagehead i could give a long winded review on how bad this album is , but let me just say this ... radiohead is one of the few bands that i fell for all the hype about . what an idiot i was , i bought this cd and listened to it about 20 times trying to figure out what it was that i was missing . i finally came to the conclusion that the masses are indeed stupid if this is supposed to be the new alternative or cutting edge or whatever . the song creep is probably one of the worst rock songs of all time and the rest of the album is totally unmemorable . garbage folks that is all this amounts to . the most overated band of all time perhaps ? oh by the way before everybody gets mad and assumes i did n't give any of their other so-called experimental releases a chance , let me say ... it ahas all been done before . you just have to dig a little deeper than mtv and rolling stone magazine to find it . do n't believe the hype !
