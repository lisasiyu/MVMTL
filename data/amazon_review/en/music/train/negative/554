misleading at best it 's simply not the best of sting '84-'94 . the version of we 'll be together ( a great song ) is an alternate take ( mix ? ) , vastly inferior to the album / radio version . it 's anemic . lacks the punch . in a word -- sucks . that you 're not told this on the cover is misleading . i really enjoy mr. sumner 's music . all the other tunes are as they should be , and they are terrific . 4-5 stars . but do n't buy this product if you expect to hear what you 've heard on the album or the radio
