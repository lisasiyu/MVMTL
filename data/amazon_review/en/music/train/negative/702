make damn sure if you happen upon the video for makedamnsure and the sound on your television is off , then you would think that the band taking back sunday is ripping one hell of a energetic and explosive tune . they look like the mc5 in the video , jumping off amps , winging guitars around there head , looking serious as all hell . but if your like me and you turn the sound back on , your going to hear that it 's another whiny and droning effort from the emo machine designed to make kids in high school feel self important . i was asked to listen to this by one of my friends . i gave it an honest to god listen , but i could n't handle it for too long . being earnest is fine , but stop with this emo stuff . you 'd think after the fiftieth clone of the same band that eventually the comsumers of this stuff would realize that it 's all the same . if you like emo , please , buy 13 songs by fugazi . they practically invented the genre , but i actually buy what they do . i do n't buy this crap , this is just the same drivel that i 've been hearing for ever . avoid at all costs .
