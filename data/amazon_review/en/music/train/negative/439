pu ... it 's pulse ultra strengths : handful of decent tracks , talent is present , cd has clean sounding guitars , vocals and bass drums , every now and then it almost gets exciting ... for a few seconds weaknesses : they do n't seem to know how to change their sound at all , almost no creativity , music is boring and not energetic at all , most tracks are long and exhausting to listen to , could have been much better than what it is i 'm surprised who p.u . is categorized with . noone else thinks they sound a tad bit akin to tool ? i could be wrong ... all i 've heard from tool in forever is their radio stuff , but this sounds alot more tool-ish to me than , oh say , taproot-ish or endo-ish . hard 'n heavy bass chords , clearly distinctive guitar rhythms and pounding bass drums , that sound just like tool . vocals have that high pitch sound thats too one keyed and too soft for me . all songs seem to run at virtually one pace..slow . the music gets boring . i ca n't hear where they 've broken any real ground or added anything cool , catchy , or different . i 'm just not digging this disc as much as i think i should be . with a cheap boombox you 're likely to miss alot of the low end that makes the music strong and enticing . so without good speakers , the music sounds even more wimpy and even more boring than with a good surround system .
