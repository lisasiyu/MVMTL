dream theater could n't get any better , but did they have to get worse ? i 'm a huge fan of dream theater , owning all their studio albums , and some singles . i loved sfam , i & w , sdoit , and awake . after their peak at sfam , i did n't expect them to release anything better . but i did n't expect them to release anything that was too bad . they did . octavarium , flat out , is n't dream theater . no guitar or drum solos , not flourishes , no pretenstious and self-indulgent metal peices . buy this if you like u2 or coldplay , do n't buy it if you like dream theater .
