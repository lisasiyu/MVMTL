i love maysa ! ! ! [ . ] let 's just get this out of the way now . maysa ? i 'm on your team babes , but this cd just has n't done it for me . i got your 1st cd & was hooked . i waited for the next & was floored ! not in a good way ! the cd jacket was so drab & tired , just like damn near every song inside the case . i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again . still i did n't feel it . it 's in my car right now & i still ca n't get through it all . i 'm still on your team though . i have your latest & i play it 2 death . over & over . cd 's 1 & 3 are both must haves . but this 1 stinks
