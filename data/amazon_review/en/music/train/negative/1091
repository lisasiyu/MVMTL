nothing on raw like sushi matches `` buffalo stance '' i just recently heard `` buffalo stance '' on my local college radio station , and it brought back memories of the first time i heard it in back in the winter of 1989 . it is n't difficult to see why this song was so popular back then ; it had all the infectious grooves an excellent pop song should have . but there 's a problem with the overall album of raw like sushi : all the songs that surround `` buffalo stance '' do n't even come close to matching its catchiness . even the inexplicably praised `` manchild '' is dull . find the single for `` buffalo stance '' if you can , and pick up a salt & pepper album as an alternative to raw like sushi .
