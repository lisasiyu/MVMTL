i could n't bring myself to listen to the whole cd i saw one of their music videos playing at walmart and thought to myself : this is really cool ! another goth/rock/alternative band along the lines of evanescence . i happen to be a big fan of evanescence and i like the mainstream twist of goth/rock/alternative . most of the times repetative music does n't bother me . you find this a lot in pop , r & b and even country . it 's almost common to mistaken a mariah carey or shania twain song for a different one . in fact , mariah even made a remix that blended 2 of her songs . to get back on track , i liked the female vocal . the songs did n't allow her full potential of her talent . the male vocals were ok . i was n't looking for a strictly goth or strictly metal band but a mix of the two . i happen to like it when artists experiment with music . otherwise linkin park would n't exist ( love 'em too ) . none of the songs really grabbed my attention . normally , there would be at least one or two i 'd really listen to on a cd . i did n't catch the name of the one that was in the music video @ walmart so after i bought it i tried to pick it out . i kept thinking to myself : this one must be it ! but when i get to the next one i think : wait , this one might be it ! then they all sounded the same so i gave up . i really tried to be open minded & and almost forced myself to pick out at least one song that would rectify purchasing a whole cd for . but they were all pretty bland . i do n't think i 've ever been so disappointed over an album purchase . due to the attempt at the mainstream rock/goth i gave it the extra star
