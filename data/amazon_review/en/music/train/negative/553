and now it 's time for another hate review well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself ? flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine ? hell no ! you see folks it 's people like lil jon that make me think in such a morbid manner . when i see special ed . failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money i tend to get a little pessimistic . but can you blame me ? seriously , let 's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second , why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd ? this is a complete joke . i 'm simply calling it like i see it . lil jon deserves no respect from any human being , not even his crack head of a mother . actually you might as well compare lil jon to elmo , elmo being a puppet has a million times more skill at what he does . at least elmo is a good and wholesome children 's icon that kids can have fun with . if i ever have a kid someday elmo will still be a hit with the kids but lil jon will still be laughed at once all his `` fans '' grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as `` music '' . meh , well who i am kidding this review ( like my last 6 ) probably wo n't even get posted anyway .
