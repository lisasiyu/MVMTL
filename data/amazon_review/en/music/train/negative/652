disappointed . i was expecting ( er , hoping for ) something closer to `` hounds of love , '' but this was spacey and unspooled . i appreciate change and i appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting , but this was a bit much for me . some songs seem to just spin off into nothingness , others drag on and on . a few songs have much triter lyrics than i expected from her , and on most her voice seems to be rambling while disregarding the music behind it . i liked one or two tracks , but overall i can not get into this
