robbie does madonna and eminem ? yuck . on first listen , this album sounds like robbie trying to do madonna and then eminem . the vocals are monotonous , the beats the same . it 's dance music , and not my cup of tea . i 'll give it another listen , but i 'm guessing there will be maybe 2 songs i 'd want to keep on this cd . pau
