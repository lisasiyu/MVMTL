do n't get your hopes up i was very excited when i finally received this cd because of all of the great reviews . i listened to the first song- it was good . i listen to the third- it was okay . by the time i reached the very end , i realized all of the songs sounded the same except for one . the music is mostly composed of the traditional rock guitar with a combination of techno sounds . the melodies have been slightly changed , and some have a slower tempo than the originals . i do n't mind any of these things . the problem i had was with their lack of a variety of different instruments and styles . all of the songs are semi-hard rock with techno sounds from late 80 's music ( i ca n't stand those cheesy saxophone sounds ) . i wish they added a few vocalists to the music , used a combination of styles , and not try to fill every second with a barrage of sounds . i suggest you buy a couple songs , but not waste your money on buying the whole cd
