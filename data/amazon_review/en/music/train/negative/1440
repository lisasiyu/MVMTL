very different to the person that mentioned jim steinman 's lack of involvement with the album , i agree . without the genius ' magic touch , meat loaf has come out with an awfully shabby album . the title song `` could n't have said it betterr myself '' offers a slight zing to the album . but when listening to the rest of the album , it is very disappointing . steinman and meat loaf are the ultimate duo . but when one is taken away , it is noticeable . i would not reccommend this album
