extremely dissapointed 76:14 , remotion , pentamouous metamorphosis ... those are global communication albums . this is pure drivel comprised mostly of ( c ) rap and trendy house music that has been remixed . my biggest complaint is that i didnt buy this cd to fill my house with the shameful vulgarities that normally accompany ( c ) rap music ( and i use the term `` music '' here very generously ) and that appear here in a few of the `` songs '' . i bought this cd because the title of the group on this album is global communication , not gun master nig*er bit*h f* ! ker ! ! ! there is nothing here that resembles the music that global communication has released under the name global communication in the past ! knowing that mark pritchard and tom middleton release music under other names makes me wonder why they didnt do so in this case ? i dont expect the same old stuff from them ( i was hoping that they actually had something new and interesting to communicate ) but packaging this garbage into a cd released under the name global communication is like packaging porn into a movie entitled disney 's bambi returns ... .it just isnt right and quite frankly , is super offensive . total waste of money for anyone expecting to hear global communication do something worthy of recording . through all their releases ( even the ones under other names ) this is the most shameful , vulgar and deviod of anything remotely worthy of musical attention , thought or reflection
