even junior vasquez fails to save this song . i 'm not into r & b so i 'll skip the tracks i 'm not interested in . bought it only for junior vasquez dub which is i must say really bad . totally boring . i think junior should release his latest work ( simone denny - cliche , deepa soul - as i am ) on cd 's instead of letting us buy only his worse mixes . very unsatisfied
