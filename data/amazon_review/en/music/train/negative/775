john fogerty premonition is the best dvd to own a dream come true i have listened to this cd , also watched the dvd , of john fogerty 's long road home on amazon . nothing can compare to his dvd of premonition.i own it love it , put it on and makes me rock out , with one of the best entertainers in his prime time of life.the guitars and instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.his voice is so excellent & clear.had some friends over with john 's premonition dvd playing.it took all of us back to that time in history.they all went to amazon and bought premonition.i know soon they will all be gone.i went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.as i consider premonition to be a collector 's dvd.if you see it again.do not wait buy it while they are available . i know its a import as most dvds are today.mine plays excellent in audio and picture.you feel like you are sitting in the audience with john performing.give premonition 10 stars.anything after john 's premonition dvd can not compare to it.no matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a cd or a dvd.premonition is the best dvd of all of times . all the rest get 1 star for trying . though not coming close to what i call my collector 's edition dvd of john fogerty 's prmonition .
