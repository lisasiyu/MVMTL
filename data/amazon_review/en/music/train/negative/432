one step closer ... to my trash can ! ! ! wow ! this is without a doubt , the worst original cast recording i have ever heard in my life ! ! ! every song is pathetic , thank god there are only 14 of them because if there were any more i would have destroyed this crap ! not even `` chitty chitty bang bang '' was this bad ( and that was really bad ) . while i was listening i kept waiting for it to get better , to have some whitty lyrics or a good melody or somthing , anything , but nothing changed it just kept getting worse . this crap includes the songs : this side of the tracks -- 1/10 one step closer -- 4/10 the buck stops here -- 5/10 it does n't take a genius -- 5/10 owner of my heart -- 5/10 the great american tv show -- 2/10 flushed down the pipes -- 5/10 storm 's a-brewin ' -- 5/10 road kill -- 5/10 but he 's mine/it 's never easy -- 3/10 that 's why i love my man -- 4/10 panic -- 5/10 finale -- 1/10 this side of the tracks ( reprise ) -- 1/10 when i bought this album i thought it was going to be another bat boy , but boy was i wrong ! do n't buy this disaster of an album you will be sorry if you do ! p.s the little lines before the numbers are minuses
