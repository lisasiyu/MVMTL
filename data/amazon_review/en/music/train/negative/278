dissapointment in the past few months , i have gotten super into all of devendra 's other works , and was excited for another little delicious surprise like the others when i first picked this album up . oh , what a dissapointment i was in for . the album does not carry through it 's energy as many of banhart 's other albums do so well . also , having already heard many other versions of the same songs that are on here on his split album with jana hunter , i found these to be much more dull , and did not carry forward their emotion in the way that the other recordings do . that being said , devendra is always quite alright , if not wonderful . i find his voice to be entirely charming , and he is generally a very talented song writer . so , the moral ? if you could n't really get into this recording , please do n't give up on devendra yet . i highly recommend `` cripple crow '' , his split album with jana hunter , and , if you are into music that is slightly more raw , `` the black babies '' , which is my personal favorite
