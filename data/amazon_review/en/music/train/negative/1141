~a step back~ daz nigga daz & kurupt the kingpin are clearly gone . when you hear quality material like `` dogg food '' and then switch to this `` saga '' cd ... one has to wonder where the effort went ? it 's always a treat to see daz and kurupt together doing stuff . they 've accomplished a bit on solo projects and dualing on other albums . but this one was a rush-to-the-studio . daz- has he changed this much ? his talent levels have kept him bringing stylish beats in the past- very jazzy , funky with many instruments felt . that 's all gone now ... .. now it 's bass , bass , bass with lost chorus direction and no style . daz 's delivery is n't even what it use to be . the pitch is very high all the time , even if the production does n't call for it . kurupt back in the studio on this one is nice . but we get a lost focus with so many destractions . and what 's clearly missing is the other lineups- no soopafly , snoop , nate , mr. malik , bad azz ... so forth . i know , i know that dpgc album is coming out to reveal that all . well daz & kurupt should 've waited instead of damaging their album archive . album had a couple of nice ones . overall , not at the level of their capability..
