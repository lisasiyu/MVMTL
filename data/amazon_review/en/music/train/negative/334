a victim of 1 disc band overviews around the turn of the century , record companies began to released one disc compilations that attempted to take artists with a ton of output and try to make an 80 minute attempt to capture the essentials . needless to say , all of these attempts have failed . great songs were overlooked , and instead of giving a quality overview of the band , one got instead the feeling of being ripped off . the cure 's greatest hits falls victim to the one disc overview . a greatet hit album serves two purposes . one is to collect the best for fans who may desire to have many of their favorites on one album . the second is to provide new-comers to the band an overview of their career . the problem with the cure is that they have released over 30 singles , and no single disc set can truly capture the best of their work . for instance , how does a cure best of ignore `` pictures of you '' ? it would be akin to a billy joel best of leaving off `` the stranger '' . this song is considered one of the cure 's best , and leaving this off for stuff like `` the walk '' , `` high '' , and `` never enough '' is an insult . while `` pictures of you '' is the biggest example of a song that is missing , there are plenty of other songs of lesser impact that still should have been on there . for instance , the sublime `` catch '' , the melancholy `` a night like this '' , or even `` jumping someone else 's train . '' and what about their break-out single , `` killing an arab '' ? the problem with this album is that it attempts to provide an overview of the cure but instead only barely touches the surface . leave this one on the cd racks and spend the extra money to get staring at the sea and galore
