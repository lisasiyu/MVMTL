recommended for insomniacs - but 5 stars for the title track sadly , one of the greatest rock songs of all time finds itself on one of the most boring rock albums of all time . to add insult to injury , the notes on the cd cover proudly boast of 'a full eight months recording ' time , which had been 'preceded by a year and a half of reflection and writing ' . we 're talking 26 months here , surely time enough to produce a decent album . instead , they produced their only good song , which i 'll say again , is an acknowledged classic , only hated by true eagles fans , as most true fans hate the classics of their favourite bands . if an unknown band had tried to get a record deal at that time on the basis of the rest of the filler , i seriously doubt they 'd have been successful . for good use of studio time see what can be done with just 30 hours of it on led zeppelin i
