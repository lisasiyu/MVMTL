po ' ruben ! i loved the big guy on american idol , hell i even voted for him , but this cd is so blah ! everything sounds the same . i can tell the cd was rushed of course , and they thought the tracks would be good just b/c he has a great voice . ever since he won he 's just been goin downhill . and i 'm not one for playing the race-card here , but in this case , come on ! mr. girly man aiken gets the cover of rolling stone and all ruben gets is the cover of jet ? ! he was the winner for goodness sake ! i guess it all ca n't be fair . and hello ! has anyone seen the video for sorry 2004 ? if a stalker ever had a theme song that one 's it . followin the poor girl , peakin around corners , puh-lease ! i could n't give the cd less than one star , otherwise , baby boy , u woulda got negative none ! zip zero , no dinero
