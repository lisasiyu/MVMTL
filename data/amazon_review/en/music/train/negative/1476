for the already faithful only , all others beware ! looking at the liner photos makes clear that falkner is the prettiest thing this side of n sync ( and does n't he know it , especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of johnnie walker black by a leggy bunny flight attendant ) . which raises the question : is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an artist ? not to put too fine an edge on it , let 's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent . falkner does everything on the cd and my reaction is so what ? his voice is mediocre ; his lyrics are banal ( & quot ; life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness & quot ; ) or precious ( & quot ; suspended on this stage of grace i have to remember this sound & quot ; ) ; the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound , with a disspiriting sameness song after song . give him two stars simply because he can do all the stuff on the record , but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to , say , chrissie hynde and john hiatt cds . we 'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs
