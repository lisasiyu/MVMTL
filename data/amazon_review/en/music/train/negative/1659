i thought they were being picky , but ... i have always loved boz and everything he has produced so far . so , when i read the reviews in preparation to purchase this album , i shook my head and said to myself , `` some people are just way too picky ! how bad could the drums be ? '' well , i found out . the drum track in this album ranges from `` mildly irritating '' to `` aaarrrrggghhhhh ! somebody shoot the drummer , please ! '' the constant brushes on the cymbals on almost every song creates a background noise that makes you feel like you 're listening to a radio station that is n't quite tuned in to the proper frequency . i was so disappointed , because boz does such a beautiful job singing these lovely songs . i ca n't make myself enjoy them , however , because i ca n't get my focus off of that freakin ' drum noise ! so , if you think some of the previous reviewers are just trying to be a little aurally precious , i assure you that they have put forth valid points - points with which i sadly concur . can somebody tell boz to remix this thing and cut out irritating cymbals guy ? sheesh .
