missing something based on my affitnity for the blues/rck genre and the 5 star rating of joe 's playing i picked up the cd/dvd combo ( amazon ) and was , i hate to admit it , dissappointed . granted , he can play and has good chops , but for me , something was missing . maybe that intangible . the fire that comes through the amps . not that his playing was not emotional or inspired form his point of view , but for me it was lacking . i need to watch it again to see if i feel the same way . like the a previous two star reviewer , i would have enjoyed seeing this guy in a local bar or someone 's basement and would walked away satisfied . but when you start playing with the big boys , this guy comes up short
