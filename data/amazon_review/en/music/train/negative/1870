brainwashing the masses it never ceases to amaze me how punk bands today consistantly preach against brainwashing when they do exactly what they condemn . anti-flag is nothing more than a gimmick band who got popular riding the `` down with the establishment '' bandwagon with little real political commentary or discourse . that being said , i fully believe that bands ( and anyone ) should have the right to say and think what they want . after all , this is america , and i am serving in the army right now to ensure that we have this right . it just gets to me how they are so willing to step on the very thing which symbolizes that right : the american flag . this album is proof yet again that this is what they intend to do . i have no respect for this traitorus band and would never give them a penny of my hard-earned money . besides , would n't a real communist refuse to capitalize on their music , anyway
