get the essential srv instead this does n't include rude mood in either studio or live version , travis walk , riviera paradise , or any of his other unbelievable instrumental guitar workouts . this compilation is a serious waste of money . virtually any album he put out would be better by itself than this compilation , especially texas flood or in step . better yet by far , though , would be to get `` the essential stevie ray vaughan and double trouble . '' it 's bargain priced , and contains every song you could want or expect , including the excellent , posthumously-released acoustic blues song , `` life by the drop . '' srv is a guitarist worth discovering , but this compilation wo n't show you anything
