why waste cd time on remixes and omit `` careless whisper '' is beyond me gee , the cd seemed fine . my favorites are here . `` everything she wants '' ( original ) , '' freedom '' , '' young guns ( go for it ) '' , '' where did your heart go ? `` , '' careless whisper '' ... hey , wait a second ... '' careless whisper '' ai n't on here . the ultimate george michael/wham ! ballad and this is supposed to be a greatest hits album and that song missed ? `` a different corner '' also ? because of stupid remixes of `` i 'm your man '' & `` everything she wants '' ? huh , i rather listen to andrew ridgeley 's solo album than those remixes . really ! psyche
