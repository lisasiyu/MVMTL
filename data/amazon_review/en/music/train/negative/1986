typical greatest hits ( not ) as with most greatest hits collections , the record company leaves off just enough hits to make you wonder & quot ; what they were thinking ? & quot ; they also put on a few tracks that make you wonder & quot ; what were they thinking ? & quot ; here , there are some obscure tracks that clearly are & quot ; filler & quot ; while omitting some of his best tracks from rock radio and even top 40 hits ? where is i found somebody ? ( oops , that was only his first top 40 & quot ; hit & quot ; ) where is & quot ; partytown & quot ; ? ( probably his best party song and a big hit on aor radio in the early 80 's ) . & quot ; do n't give up & quot ; was also a rock radio track and a great song from his first album . i would title this album & quot ; some hits , some mediocre stuff , some stuff sorely missing , sorry. & quot ; now , where is that eagles box set we have been waiting 20 years for
