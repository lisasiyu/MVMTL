ok but not a bel canto singer anna netrebko 's i puritani selections are way below the art and skill of callas , sills , sutherland , caballe , and gencer . she has no passion , no trills , no high notes that are deep and rich . her best is in the russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding mozart . her broadcast from the met live of the i puritani was alright , but scooping , avoidance of repetitions , running through passages like a locomotive , and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again , and a tight awful sounding high note . the same tentativenes is also here on this cd.she should know this . her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses , not the voice , which is forgiven everything . too bad ; she could be a lovely tatyana some day.also too , the traviata is not that great ; anna moffo , renee fleming , m. caballe , and of course maria callas..listen to these and hear the difference
