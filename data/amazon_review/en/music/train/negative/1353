flat and limp voice i like about 3 or 4 songs on here . i hate to sound negative but what i do not like about this cd is that , jo'omeara sounds very pitchy in most of the songs ... her voice starts to sound flat and very monotone after 1 or 2 songs . she does'nt have much range . she just raises her voice . her voice sounds shakey and unstable . especially on `` relentless '' the very first track . i love the song , i really do but her voice sounds like any minute shes gon na break down and cry . i am not a great singer myself but , jo omeara needs some voice lessons . her voice is very drab and boring . it 's nothing extra . for some reason she sounded so much better with s club 7 ... you know what , the songs on the album are great , if kelly clarkson or jessica simpson sang them . i listen to the songs and just imagine `` what if ... '' ... it gets me through the songs i like
