therion junior let me start off by saying that i am a fan of operatic metal . i love therion , theatre of tragedy , tristiana , lacuna coil , nightwish , all of the bands that any self respecting music fan should listen to . however , i should have seen this one coming . i must say , witohut a frickin doubt , this is the cheesiest album that i have ever had the displeasure of listening to . i shelled out 15 bucks for this album and i wish that i saved my money and bought a knife and stabbed myself in the frickin eardrums , and then bought a bucket of sulfuric acid and drowned myself in it . the band overall has good musicianship , ( and their singer is hot ) , yet they write sub par music with cheesy medieval themes . the band has potential , and it might help if the f***in music video was n't a sing along with the words at the bottom of the screen . please , if you are considering purchasing this album , dont make the same mistake i did , and buy therion 's lemuria/sirius b . trust me , you 'll be glad you shelled out the extra 5 clams
