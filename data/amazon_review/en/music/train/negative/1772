backround music when i bought this i was looking forward to the blending of the flute and the harp . i have wind songs and some hilary stagg and other harp music in my collection . this cd dissapointed me . the flute is much louder than the harp and when i turned up the volume to hear the harp the flute became too shrill for my ears . my second letdown is that there is no passion or emotion in the performance . it sounds like some musicians playing sheet music for money . the musicians are very good technically , but they are performing music that they did not choose or compose and their lack of emotional commitment seems evident . michael hoppe wrote the music but he does not perform on any of the songs . the liner notes say that this is music to play in the background while having diner . maybe that is what it is intended for , it 's just not what i was looking for
