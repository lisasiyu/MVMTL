repetitive and uncreative yup..those are two of the biggest problems with day of fire . they have an overused hard rock/grunge sound to begin with , and all the songs on the album sound exactly the same . cornerstone , through the fire and time stand out on their on , whereas the rest of the songs sound too formulated . hopefully there next release will be a bit more creative
