3 or 4 good songs there are 3 or 4 good songs on this cd . if you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them . others are way to slow and boring for kids to get excited about . there are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren 's cd . it seems like they could n't decide whether to make a cd to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one cd . that does n't work for my kids . john lithgow `` singin in the bathtub '' is a much better choice . the songs are upbeat and lively . my kids ask for that one all the time
