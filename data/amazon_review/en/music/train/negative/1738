what a mess first the sound quality is poor - i had my stereo turned almost up to max and it was just loud enuf to hear . then there are the uncredited/unlisted `` bonus tracks '' - they are comercials/radio ads for ike & tina . the version of `` river deep , mountain high '' is not the phil spector version .
