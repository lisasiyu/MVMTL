disappointment this cd was uttely boring it sounded like dianne did n't even care that she was singing . it was a disappointment to me becuase she usually is pretty excting . i felt like she did n't do enough to make this cd perfect . i mean if it was just a regualar person putting out their very first cd , it would n't sound like this , becuase it would n't sell ! okay so , i have to give it 2 stars becuase at times it sounds relazing and nice , but then i think that every christmas cd should be as excting as christmas really is
