insulting do you think if i wrote some nursery rhyme lyrics from bizzaro world and starting singing in a voice more suited to sesame street that i could get a record contract too like devendra banhart ? his record has to be some kind of inside joke , or the efforts of one seriously untalented individual . sprouting nonsensical phrases one after the other might pass as genius among some people but i want a bit more substance to my music . i found this record personally insulting because it 's obvious that someone out there felt you can just put out any old crap filled with `` strange and fantastic '' lyrics that are ultimately meaningless and people would evitably go out and buy it because it 's 'unique ' and that your uncool if you do n't get 'it ' ( whatever 'it ' is ) . if you want to listen to a quality record by a singer-songwriter than go check out bright eyes ' `` i 'm wide awake , it 's morning '' or damien rice 's `` o '' and steer clear of this insult to good taste
