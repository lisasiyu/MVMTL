shame there are no negative ratings , b/c it sure deserves one . the production quality is almost as bad as the depressingly awful music . do n't be fooled folks . the `` artistic '' hacks may love it , but beauty is truely in the eye of the beholder . if you enjoyed the awesome first 3 soundtracks ; do n't waste your money on this one expecting more of the same . instead you will receive a cd chocked full of unimaginative ( i.e . high-schoolers without talent playing on their home computers ) techno and `` spoken word '' type lyrics that are laughably bad ( but only if you did n't shell out $ 13.99 to listen to them ) . i 'm now the proud owner of a $ 14.00 coaster , b/c that 's about all it 's good for
