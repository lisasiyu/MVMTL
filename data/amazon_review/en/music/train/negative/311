glen ballard is the kiss of death to all artists this guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers . olp have no business working with him and the result shows . olp is way out of ballards league and i have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music . perhaps olp wanted to have a sell-out sound , otherwise this disc is a disaster . somewhere out there is pure disposable pop . none of this material would be on `` happiness '' or `` spiritual machines '' how can you go from a concept album from a ray kurzveil book to a horrible glen ballard . over produced , pop record
