oh no another boy band oh please save me from these boy bands . there are way too many boybands out now . and who is the world is c-note . they arent even famous and nobody even knows who they are . n-e-ways they dont sound good at all and im glad i didnt waste my money by buying this cd . so if you really want to listen to a boy band go and listen to nsync , backstreet boys , or 98 degrees cause at least they know how to sing
