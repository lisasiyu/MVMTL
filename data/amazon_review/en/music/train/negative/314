rem : gate keepers to the dust bin of music history . here , in all their glory , is rem : the undisputed pied pipers of the bedwetters . while michael stipe 's nasal delivery evoked all the comfort of a german stuka dive-bomber , the whimpering and ludicrous lyrical content became a beacon-call to legions of self-absorbed suburban cry-babies everywhere . in rem , we had a calculating and maudlin brood of cynical mountebanks who lounged in opulence while tormenting their naive minions with a decades-long barrage of unrestrained nonsense and pessimistic doomsaying . the embarrassing spectacle probably hit its painful peak in 1992 , but it obviously has left a cultural skid mark that will take years to eradicate . this album is a one star stinker that might serve well as a gag gift
