one good number i heard `` heart of mine '' in the closing credits for the movie runaway jury . after listening to the album , i found that was really the only tune i liked . peter malick is a veteran of the hard-charging james montomery band ( who i have seen tear up stages of northeast blues clubs ) , which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me . you could argue that he is going for a `` relaxed '' feel , to which i would repsond he succeeds all too well . norah jones can sing , and sing well- no argument there , but these songs are not great . the lyrics i found to be a little too clever , like some music student 's term paper . for most of the album i felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful . having said all this , `` heart of mine '' is an excellent record , and might even be worth the price of the cd . of course , to get the one good track , you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite mp3 site .
