modern life is rubbish . high record sales are often inversely proportionate to the effect on the morale of the bands concerned . blur became household names in britain because of this album , especially through cheerful cockney singalong sinle `` parklife '' , but it messed them up in terms of moving on as a band : it is also the album which was responsible for singer/writer damon albarn 's mental breakdown . but what did they expect ? this is , after all , the album that summed up britain 's geezer culture : where men are men and women act like men as well . where the thatcherism of the 80s has never really gone away , and it 's okay to look after number 1 and act like a bit or a moron . this album , for better or worse ( in my opinion , worse ) is more representative of britain in the 90s and noughties than anything else . if you 're american and still think that britain is all hugh grants and tea on the village green , forget it . and here 's the proof . the album itself is cheerful enough , but totally uninspired . it bears none of the influence from american acts of the 80s and 90s , like nirvana , sonic youth , the meat puppets or dinosaur jr. , or brit acts like my bloody valentine . guitarist graham coxon 's love of these bands hardly shows in the songs , because they 're written by albarn . just tunes , many of which are distinctly ordinary . even much-lauded songs like `` this is a low '' are let-downs , because they do n't display any real savvy for what makes modern music any different from the songcraft of the beatles or the kinks . indeed , blur are just like a modern kinks . just without the great songs . it 's sad that with this album , blur confirmed what the title of their previous album had said . modern life is rubbish
