bon jovi meets nashville ! a rewiver in a big music magazine wrote that this record reminded him of bottle rockets and the drive-by truckers . he must be kiddin` . you ca n't compare apples with oranges . i rather say it sounds like bon jovi were playin somekind of nashville pop-country , like the great divide . some compare this to legends like lynyrd skynyrd and allman bros . they couldnt have been listening to the same record as me ! but if you like shelby lynne and pat greens newer stuff , lend an ear to these guys . but if you want blood , search the real thing in these bands the lost trailers thinks they have something in common with .
