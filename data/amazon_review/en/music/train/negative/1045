not my thing.. why does this cd not appeal to me ? well , it does n't have what it takes ( in my opinion ) to reach inside of me and make me tap my foot to the beat . his previous songs did that . sure , will is growing and i hope he continues to grow but this cd was a disappointment to me . i expected more . should you buy this cd ? sure ! if you 're a fan of will then go for it . if you want a totally different style of will then give it a bash . if you 're looking for some upbeat music that will make you bop your head at a party or while driving then i suggest you pick another cd
