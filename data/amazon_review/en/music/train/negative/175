trash on top of garbage boy , and i thought `` cats '' was bad . this is the single most boring , stupid , pointless and utterly awful piece of music garbage that has ever had the misfortune to befoul my ears . there is no story line , no range in music , no feeling , no lyrics to back up the awful music . i mean , the list could go on forever . i warn you , it 's the biggest waste of $ 25.00 that you might , no , will ever spend . please , do yourself a favor and trust me . don '' t buy the cd ! ! ! and if you do , when you put it on , you 'll know exactly what i 'm talking about.you 've been warned . now please , spend your well earned money on something that actually has a purpose in life
