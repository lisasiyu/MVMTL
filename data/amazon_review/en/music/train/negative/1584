bring back bushwick and get rid of willie-d ... .. arrrrgggghhh ! this was the worst geto boys offering i have heard to date ! obviously scarface was n't enough to save this & quot ; album & quot ; . why was n't bushwick in on this one ? most of the songs were performed by willie-d and i 'm sorry but willie-d ca n't rap ! there is n't one single song on this album that i would refer to anyone ! this gb product deserves to be put in the trash . i 'm a true geto boys fan and i say to other gb fans out there : do n't buy this album ! ! ! ! ! ! !
