oregon 's `` prime '' is sadly mistitled i have been a fan of oregon 's since they surprised me at the 1974 newport in new york jazz festival . they walked onto the avery fischer hall stage in saffron gowns , grabbing their tablas , sitars , and other indian instruments , and all i could say to myself was , `` oh , this wo n't be jazz . '' their electrifying performance proved otherwise . it was the best set i heard in the entire festival , and oregon went on to be a progressive force in jazz for many years afterward . however , i found `` prime '' to be much like the homogenized music that populates the `` smooth jazz '' airways . though their performances are still of virtuoso quality , the compositions on this cd struck me as formless , generic and unmemorable . i will always appreciate oregon 's body of work , but i can not recommend this cd as one that is representative of their prodigious gifts
