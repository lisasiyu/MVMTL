( rating : 1 out of 10/ ) this ai n't even good pop music ! now usually if i know 100 % that something is wack , i wo n't waste my money on it and can just download it for free . now i wish that i did n't even do that at all . a lot of reviewers seem to have faced the facts : paris can not sing ! this here has proven that clearly . now that i think about it , what can she do ? ... other than being a rich [ female ] who keep her name in the news ( that `` e ! '' channel if anyone actually watches that ) on something stupid . now on to this . there is no other explaimation to it except that it sucks . the original song sucks , and the four remixes are even worse , not to mention that some of them are pretty long in length . but lets face the facts ; despite many 1 or 2 star reviews , bull [ ... ] music is going to sell . true , if the rap group dead 4 life can have a high selling single `` laffy taffy '' and have their album go gold , there is no telling for what numbers paris hilton will put up , just because it 's her . easily one of the worst songs i 've heard in the past 5 years . take my advice : there is halfassed talent out there that is better than this . also $ 18 is too much to have something to sit your drinks on . and if this is imported , it should have been confiscated when trying to get through u.s. customs . it 's that bad ! when songs like this see the light of day , you know that shes doing whatever she can to stay relevant . lyrics : f production : d- musical vibes :
