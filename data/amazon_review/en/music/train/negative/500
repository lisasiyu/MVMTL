disappointing mixing contrary to the previous review , i find that commenting on the quality of the mixing on this cd to be essential . it has to be the sloppiest 'exhibition ' of professional mixing that i 've heard consigned to disc . it just sounded like there was too much emphasis on getting as many tracks on in 70 mins , regardless of flow , or beat matching . very let down by this disc
