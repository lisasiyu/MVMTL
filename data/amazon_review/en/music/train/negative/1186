poor mixes , poor sound someone pointed out in another review that the songs are presented in the original mono versions . more than that , i also have the chartbusters ( 12 cds ) mowtown compilation and in addition some old vinyl recordings , and i have noticed that the actual _mixes_ are not even the same as the original recordings . for instance , on stevie wonder 's `` for once in my life '' and glady knight and the pips ' `` i heard it through the grapevine '' there are parts that are just plain missing . i 'm very disappointed , as my favorite songs do not sound at all as i remember them . update : i listened again . i think i might have been mistaken when i said that parts were just plain missing . i think it 's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions . it just a shame that the original record company could n't have done a better job in light of the advent of the cd
