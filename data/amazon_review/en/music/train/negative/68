rockin randall ? ? ? ? at no point in my following review am i by any means intentionally downing hank jr . i am just trying to give an honest review of this cd . at the time this album was realeased , hank jr. was riding high , winning big at the cma 's and acm 's . he was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career . but then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll . to me this cd is a studio recorded version of a hank williams jr. live concert . the only difference is he did n't botch the vocals as he does on his live show . the music is decidedly 80 % not country , it drifts towards eighties rock . if you trace hank jr. 's recording career , you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of . i must say though , this cd contains one of hanks last top 10 hits , `` if the south woulda won , '' which is an hard to find recording on his compilations . i 'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise , just because of that song .
