going slightly mad ... . buy this disc if you want to feel like someone stole your favorite toy , tagged it with profane sharpie writing , and then tried to sell it back to you as something new ; gavin 's version of we are the champions made me feel like stabbing myself in the eye with my pen ; eleven 's version of stone cold crazy made me feel like i was having a seriously horrible acid trip ; and breaking benjamin 's version of who wants to live forever sounded like i had the vocals slowed down but the music was sped up ; good rock song + crappy artists = cringe worthy remakes that never should have been released ; this album is only getting 1 star because i dont think it will let me give it 0 and constantines version of bohemian rhapsody is awesome ! it the only song worth listening and you can probably download it some where or get it from your dumb friend who bought the disc and then relized it what a piece of crap ...
