neutral milk hotel ripoff i get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about . hate to break it to you kids , but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s . it was called neutral milk hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the decemberists . before you disagree with me , go pick up neutral milk hotel 's in the aeroplane over the sea ( 1997 ) , and then try to disagree
