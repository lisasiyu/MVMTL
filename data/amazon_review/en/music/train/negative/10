rating box would not accept 0 ... please change your name to ( kid rap ) .. when you start producing true rock cd 's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name ... stop playing both sides.. i realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about.. do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music . one day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..
