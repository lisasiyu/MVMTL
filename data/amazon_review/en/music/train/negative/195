supa dupa garbage . what a thought provoking and creative album title.i wonder how long it took her to come up with that name ? i cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.all the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.she cant produce , rap write or do much of anything of value.i saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.listen to some real artists like black sabbath , judas priest or iron maiden.dont forget to vote for my review
