an artist in flux precious is an interesting document of a band in flux , searching for a sound . gnecco 's voice is in fine form , but on only his second record , he is repeating himself . the wonderful falsetto is heard hitting the same notes over and over again , which begs the question , is there true vocal range here , or a couple of parlor trick notes ? we will not be sure until we hear more form ours . when not in falsetto , gnecco is developing a kind of warble that will alienate many listeners who prefer a cleaner vocal delivery . in addition , the chemistry between the band seems off , making the album sound incohesive or even over-dubbed , the guitar lines which milone and gnecco intend to create tension which boils over to melodic changes , seem dissonant and unneccessary . this music would be better served by simpler production . ethan johns could probably stand to play a bit more drums - it almost seems like he is deliberately restraining himself in the context of music that is n't sure weather it 's hard rock or singer-songwriter stuff . & quot ; leaves & quot ; is the lone high spot for this album , with its catchy beatles meets u2 progression . the rest of the album , as typified by & quot ; kill the band & quot ; lacks cohesion , hooks , and musical identity . instead of just letting the songs flow and write themselves , it seems like gnecco is forcing things and deliberately trying to be complex with concepts that are essentially simple . lyrically , gneeco could use some help , as he is repeating rhymes , and syllabic patterns all over the place . from a standpoint of lyical meaning , the album is pretty much the standard emo / alt rock / depressed vibe . nothing new here . maybe just a sophomore jinx . stay tuned
