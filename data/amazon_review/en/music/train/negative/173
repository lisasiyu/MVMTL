they were labelled `` creative '' as children i have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner 's music class , and i will call it art . people will write many reviews about the music , and they will say it is wonderful , and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages . they will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks . music is not suppossed to hurt the ears . to call this good music is an insult to good musicians . i will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer , for clearly they were higher than a kite , no , make that a weather ballon , when they composed the album . creative ; maybe . listenable , enjoyable , humable , playable when company is over ; no
