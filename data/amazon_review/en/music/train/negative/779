not that good stick with blitzkid because they can sing ten times better than this guy . he is also in blitzkid actually and he plays drums ... where he belongs . the songs on this cd are very well written and played , its just a shame that the singing is so forced and cheesy . i mean i know this is supposed to be 50 's style doo-wop rock , but please . better things in the genre ... .like blitzkid
