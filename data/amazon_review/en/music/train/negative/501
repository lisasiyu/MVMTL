consumer warning - critical flaw in mastering the charming 1977 musical is not the subject of this note . the show is great and the liner notes are superb . however , consumers should note that there is a critical flaw in the mastering ( at least on the disc version that i obtained ) . it is very unfortunate that the manufacturers did not pull this mis-mastered version from the market . as noted elsewhere ( and absolutely correct ) , an entire track of sound is lost and can only be heard distantly in the background . if the problem is corrected and later discs are ok , it just compounds the problem with no way to know if you have a flawed disc or an ok disc . a most unfortunate problem for what should be a joyous recording
