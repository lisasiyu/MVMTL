joss stone i traded my girlfriend my nickelback cd for joss stone . now i kinda wished i had kept my nickelback cd . she hates the nickelback cd and i hate the joss stone cd , but she also hates the joss stone cd . if i kinda liked the nickelback cd better i would of kept it because i kinda knew i was n't going to be into the joss stone cd . but i just kind of figured the joss stone cd would be a little bit better than the nickelback cd and my girlfriend was completely thinking that the nickelback cd was gon na be a lot better than the joss stone cd , but man was she let down completely . and for as much as i really do n't want the nickelback cd back at this point i just assume let her keep it and i 'll get by with the joss stone cd . i mean i guess what i am trying to say is that i sorta liked the nickleback cd in the beginning , but once my girlfriend said she hated it i figured i got the better end of the bargain by trading her for the joss stone cd which at first seemed like a much better cd to have than nickelback . i think my girlfriend wants to trade back again and if we do then i guess i just have to live with the nickelback cd , but i 'll prolly never play it again if she gives it back to me . bleh ! ! matthew
