waylon jennings sings hank williams this was a great disappointment . waylon must have been in the bathroom and the muscians in the lounge when this recording was made ! i love waylon jennings but the vocals are so distorted and the music so loud that it was very hard to tell who was singing . i 'm sure if the recording had of been better quality i would have loved this
