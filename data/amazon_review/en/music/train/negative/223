good only for filling in the blanks this cd is a total misrepresentation . many of the songs are very poorly done concert versions of songs . they even use the exact same audience cheering track on several songs . buy it only if you are a fan looking to fill in missing songs in your collection . do n't buy it thinking you are getting all the original hits . 14 songs are live . one appears to be re-recorded . the rest are the originals . also , on cd # 2 many of the media tags are incorrect . when you play `` all i really need is you '' ( live ) the title `` heartbreak hotel '' shows . when you play `` headed for the future '' the song title `` all i really need is you '' shows . when you play `` heartbreak hotel '' the song title `` headed for the future '' shows . overall , a very sloppy project they obviously just rushed to market not caring about quality
