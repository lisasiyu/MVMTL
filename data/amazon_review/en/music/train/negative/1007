no fun ! i can not believe this is marketed as a karaoke cd ! this is just a regular music cd with the lyrics inside the package . the lyrics do not show up on the tv screen when put into the karaoke machine . no fun at all if you have to hold the microphone with one hand the the lyrics in another , under good light because the type is so small ! ! ! ! oh yeah , great fun for a 6 year old ... ..not ! !
