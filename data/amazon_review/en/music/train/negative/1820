turn around - jonny lang 's newest cd this is not up to par with his prior releases . i did not care for his genre with this album . i prefer his more bluesy music . he has a greatvoice and is a fabulous musician , but this cd does not bring out either abilities . it is a very average cd . in fact , i can not remember a single tune from it 20 minutes after listening to it . i would like to see jonny go back to the music that made him popular . i do n't believe that it would go against his new-found faith .
