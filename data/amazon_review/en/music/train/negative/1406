too bad the album is n't as strong as & quot ; fly & quot ; i first heard word of the track & quot ; fly & quot ; in a review of arf ! arf ! records ' & quot ; a heavy dose of lite psych & quot ; compilation in mojo magazine . the reviewer vowed that this track was worth the price of admission by itself , everything else was bonus . i was intrigued by the description of & quot ; what radiohead may have sounded like in the summer of love & quot ; . receiving the compilation cd , i immediately listened to this track and completely fell in love with it . when i heard the album had been re-released , i jumped at the chance to buy it . i have to admit i set myself up for disappointment . the only other tracks that come close to comparing are & quot ; land of sensations and delights & quot ; ( little more than two minutes ) , & quot ; christine & quot ; and & quot ; the times & quot ; . none of these tracks can match & quot ; fly & quot ; , however , and many of the others sound like jay forgot to write the rest of the song ( like the last track on side 1 , & quot ; nobody & quot ; , if i remember correctly ) . it 's still interesting , but i would not rate it as five stars . i 'm hoping i 'm not misled with aerovons and gandalf ( both of which i 'm getting ready to buy , and comparisons to the beatles and the zombies are enjolling me to buy these )
