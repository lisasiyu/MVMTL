it 's time for jayz to find some new rapping talent ... well , the young gunz basically suck . their lyrics are very weak and wack and the choruses they come with are extremely lame . they also have very generic voices and flows which make for a boring listen . the production as a whole is decent at best . however , this album is 100 times better than the atrocity that is memphis bleek - 534 . but it 's still not good . jayz needs to clean the rap house and get rid of these 'guys ' that call themselves rappers . he should keep kayne , sigel , and freeway and then cut the deck and start recruiting . young gunz & memphis weak just do n't have what it takes to carry simple songs let alone the entire roc for years to come . please jayz for the sake of the roc 's good name ... get rid of these tag along bums bringing it down . 1 star
