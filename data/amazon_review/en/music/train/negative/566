should a comedy album feature pity laughter ? do you remember the guy in high school or college who tried to be the class clown but failed miserably ? well , eugene mirman is less entertaining than that guy . i 'm not being sarcastic about the pity laughter ... that 's the most laughter here , and yes , this was recorded live . how the record company heard this and still felt comfortable releasing it is beyond me . perhaps it 's a tax write-off
