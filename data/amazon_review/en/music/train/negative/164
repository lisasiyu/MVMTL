number ones-the bee gees although i 'm a great fan of the brothers work , i feel this album an insult to the serious bee gees collector . the tracks here are not rare , new or even unavailable . time for barry & robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off . even robin 's latest redition `` a live cd '' whoooooopie doo , again songs of old hat ... ..i 'm hungry for new material not oldies . and please do n't get me wrong , it broke my heart when maurice died , my world stopped and i do sympathise with barry , robin and the rest of their family . being a fan for 30 something years i 've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come ... .but please some new songs are needed from the brothers . so come on barry get together with robin and show us the great writing talent you still have . a devoted listener talisman , dundee
