very disappointed i bought this cd for my son - we are searching for good r & amp ; b / rap with a positive message - we were very disappointed in this cd - the recording quality was lacking , the beats very repetitive and uninspiring , you could hardly hear the words - overall - we are listing this cd for sale and we just bought it yesterday ! my husband , son and i all agreed within ten minutes that this cd was not a winner
