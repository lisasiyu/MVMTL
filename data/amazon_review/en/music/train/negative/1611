journey - 'trial by fire ' ( sony ) apparently , their last work with frontman steve perry and quite the let down.'trial ... ' was the band 's '96 comeback attempt , but if i remember correctly this cd was a stiff from the get-go.i tried so hard to get into this fifteen track disc , but even with a duration of 68 minutes , i just couldn't.the songs do n't completely suck , they just do n't appear to have much life.fantastic cover , do n't you agree ? if you 're an old school journey fan , i encourage you to check out their new 2005 release , 'generations ' with vocalist steve augeri , who 's been with the band for awhile now.that cd is surprisingly good , as i 'd give it 3 1/2 , maybe 4 stars.keep in mind that guitarist neal schon is their 'key ' player
