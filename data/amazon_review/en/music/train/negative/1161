purple city - the purple city album purple city 's debut release is `` the purple album '' ( 2006 ) . having made their mark on the mixtape scene the dipset affiliate trio of emperor shiest bub , un kasa & don bishop agallah provide this release . the harlem trio start off the album with `` live your life '' repping their group and thanking the diplomats for paving the way , the best part of this track for me is the chorus . the typical `` gangsta '' has shiest bub collaborating with jim jones and max b backed by the kind of beat that will put you to sleep , the verses are equally boring . laidback `` fly high '' follows , backed by some mellow production purple city pays tribute to smoking weed in what turns out to be a smooth cut . i do n't know if purple city is paying tribute to the south movement , or trying to capitalize on it with `` trap n**** '' either way it 's a weak attempt to sound like young jeezy , its actually disturbing . `` go head '' follows purple city proclaims being gangster again on another halfhearted cut . `` nick nack '' is a lame attempt at a club track , horrible chorus . tec , steele and buckshot drop in for the grimy `` hustlers '' . agallah , un kasa and affiliate ike eyes team up for another bland cut with `` picture me rollin '' . shiest bub collabs with a-mafia on `` head bust open '' rhyming in a braggy manner while warning not to mess with purple city . purple city 's decides to spell things out again on `` p.a.y.d.a.y. '' . while `` grind slow '' feat . buddy klein is a below average cut where the group talk to the ladies . shiest bub closes the album off with `` catch him '' repping himself . lyrically this group is not entertaining or original - listening to them i feel like i have heard it all somewhere else before . none of them have distinct flows and production is average . if you love dipset and are into that whole movement you may like this . this may sound brutal but listening to the `` the purple album '' to me is like watching a bad b movie , not worth my time .
