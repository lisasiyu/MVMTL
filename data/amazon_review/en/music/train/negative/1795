atrocious and soulless i do n't know what you people are talking about . this album is horrendous . terrible , peter-frampton-cum-boston arrangements of velvets songs . the guitar tones alone are enough to make me want to scream . this is not rock , nor is it animalistic . for anyone who loves this album , i recommend doing drugs . or having some soul
