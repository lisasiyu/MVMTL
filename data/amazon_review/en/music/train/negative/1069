go listen to real blues basically ... kenny wayne is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen . i mean sure hes got a little speed but he 's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there ! seriously he ca n't even solo over chord changes ! i 've heard him compared to the likes over srv . whoever thinks that is plain deaf . if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray , freddie king , albert collins or johnny winter . i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd
