juvi needs his own reality check after putting this out ! juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career . he marinated on the underground until cash money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s . but then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer . even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down , leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there . b.g . went the independent route , holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a hot boy . turk followed suit , but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars . juvenile found himself going the solo route , although he did briefly return in 2003 for juve the great . now with atlantic , juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release reality check . `` get your hustle on '' is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead . `` i know you know '' with trey songz is a good contender for the radio . `` around the way '' is a song for the hood to know that he ai n't never left and he does n't plan to either . `` sets go up '' with wacko is so-so , while his first single `` rodeo '' is the millennium version of `` back that [ ... ] up '' only with a more subdued approach . unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there . `` what 's happenin ' '' is nothing to write home about , `` loose booty '' is another song devoted to the [ ... ] -shaking community , and `` break a brick down '' deliberately borrows a beat from another cash money track . `` who 's ya daddy '' is pointless , along with the annoying `` keep talkin ' '' with skip and redd eyezz and `` why not . '' bun b makes another poor decision by collaborating on `` rock like that . '' the biggest shocker has to be `` addicted '' with brian mcknight making a dumb career move . not only does brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time ( and hopefully his last , ) but juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them ( think oran juice jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of `` the rain . '' ) there are a lot of other dreadful songs on reality check that i 'm not even going to bother mentioning . this has to be the worst disc that juvenile has ever put together in recent memory . with an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable , reality check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and ca n't live with yourself if you do n't buy the album . one thing is for sure ... juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come .
