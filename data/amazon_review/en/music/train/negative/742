one great song does not a classic make other than heavy metal drummer , this album is totally mediocre . this album is perhaps the most overated , overhyped alternative album of all time . i do not see what all the fuss was about . i guess that sums up wilco for me in general . i could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering . download heavy metal drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs
