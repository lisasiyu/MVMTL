leaves a lot to be desired ... being a long time fan of mlwttkk , i immediately pre-ordered this tribute/remix collection . upon hearing the first few moments of this cd , it was blatantly clear that whoever remixed these kult classics had little regard for the originals ' lustre . the mixes are light , airy ... . pure fluff . do n't expect any chest-thumping industrial beats that tkk has delivered to its fans for many a year . the mixes butchered the originals to the point that it 's not even novel , just cotton candy filler . how tkk allowed this malformed release is beyond me . the only purpose i see that this `` tribute '' could serve is to introduce tkk to a young lightweight , whose ears are not used to original industrial epics . either that , or only for the hardcore tkk fan who just wants to have every release . the dust on my copy is already accumulating , and probably will for some time . if you 're looking to dip your toes into my life with the thrill kill kult , do n't buy this cd . stick with the new greatest hits release , or better yet , start with any release prior to `` hit & run holiday ''
