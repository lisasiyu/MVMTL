deeply disappointing ... i ran out and bought this cd the very day it came out . then sat listening anxiously for something to stir inside of me . alas , nothing . a few weeks later , still nothing . a month later , i tried again . i yawned ... then i got up and cleaned the kitchen finding that more interesting . when i first started listening to zero 7 , i was drawn , pulled , attached to their music . i got it , it got me -- we connected . my friend mel asked me the other day how this cd was and i let her listen to it ; she yawned and said , `` i guess they 've lost it '' . should they release another cd , i 'd borrow it from the library first and then buy it only if i really love it . but this cd was deeply disappointing..
