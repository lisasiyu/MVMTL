this is only for the die hard fans ! if you have never heard mecano before , do not buy this one . the new songs are garbage at best . and even as a greatest hits collection , this fails . buy all of the albums except this one . the best albums to buy for a new listener are & quot ; entre el cielo y suelo & quot ; and & quot ; descanso dominical & quot ; . this features 7 new tracks , 1 remake , and 22 of the classics ( but they left off several of their all time greatest like & quot ; cuervas de esa chica & quot ; y & quot ; laika & quot ; y & quot ; el cine & quot ; ) . i give it 2 stars because i have so much respect for the work they 've done in the past . but this was a really lame production
