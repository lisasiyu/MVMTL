i hope the islands do n't lack the soul this cd does . completely disappointed . no soul , no tradition . save your money unless you 're into ub40 and synthesized reggae ... ugh . it is all to obvious why there are no samples of this cd on the web page . i took one for the team ... buyer beware . support local music
