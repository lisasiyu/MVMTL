not all that dont buy this cd . i dont know what all the hype is about , but boy was i fooled . the lyrics and the flow are below average , and yeah , there are some weird sounds in there , but the beats are nothing special either . i bought this , put it in my car , and within a couple songs i had to turn it off . i tried the next day , same thing . there is a lot of good underground hip-hop out there , so buy some of it instead
