sad ... i 'm a metal head but i 'm not a fan of this type of metal but the quality is good and these guys are somewhat from my area , but i 'm just not a fan of the rah , rah , rah , blah , blah screaming mess . i love the guitars and the band itself just no vocals and melody . it 's very one dimensional , but different strokes for different folks . if you like war hooting and demon squealing death metal then you 'll love this . sorry guys not a fan of it ( just an opinion though , do n't get bent over it )
