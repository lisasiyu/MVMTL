just another generic grindcore band trying to make it somewhere ... to be quite honest , i do n't understand how anyone could consider this trash to be music . it is just a bunch of noise . i could do what these guys do with a bunch of 13-14 year old amatuer drum , guitar , and bass players in my garage . there is little to no rhythm to their music , and the vocals , quite frankly , are horrible . i ca n't even tell one song apart from another . grindcore just makes metal look bad . the only grindcore bands i actually do enjoy are pig destroyer and agoraphobic nosebleed . go listen to some of their stuff if you want good grindcore . ed gein is just talentless garbage . do n't bother with the tony danza tap dance extravaganza either
