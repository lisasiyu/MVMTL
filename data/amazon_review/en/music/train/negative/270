my ears are throwing up ! wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal . that 's how wack paul wall is . after i have eaten a full meal and listened to paul wall , my dinner is regurgitated through my ears . i am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage . this guy would n't know lyrical content if i slapped him with a mos def cd
