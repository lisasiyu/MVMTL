aint nobody hatin , this cd is garbage with the exception of missy , and lil kim track , this whole cd will make a great coaster at best . the only who can truly enjoy this album is someone who has a one track mind for partyin ' only . this is no hip hop compilation . straight dance to the fullest . pop for the most part . and tracks of hits that i did n't even no was hits , by a rapper almost no one cares about . even though i do like some of what he puts out but still , addin yourself on hits album just make people diss him more
