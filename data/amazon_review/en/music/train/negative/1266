rosemary clooney missing ... arrangements not the usual ! if you 're a fan of either `` holiday inn '' or `` white christmas '' you really , really should avoid this one . its recording quality not only offers substandard `` tin can '' sound , but you wo n't find rosemary clooney on a single track from white christmas . this is not a soundtrack . it 's a studio version of songs that sound familiar from the movies but were not performed this way on screen . disappointing to say the least , as me and mine are avid fans of these christmas-themed films . the two stars i 've placed here are generous , but i could n't move down to one ... `` hate '' does n't fit . i am , however , not keeping this cd . too depressing and not at all what i hoped to hear . if you 're a true fan of the films , these recordings wo n't be what you hope to hear , either . good luck in finding the real thing !
