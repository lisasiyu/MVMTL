out to lunch since `` luck of the draw '' bonnie raitt or her record producers have been out to lunch . `` fundamental '' sounds like a jam session gone bad . there is really nothing special on this cd , except for `` the spit of love '' . when are we going to hear a song like `` when the spell is broken '' again ? bonnie seems to have passed the female blues guitar mantle to sue foley and kris wiley . sorry , i 'll stick with her old albums
