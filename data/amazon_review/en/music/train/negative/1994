a big letdown the debut blues traveler cd was truly fascinating . great jams fueled by some catchy songs such as gina , but anyway , warmer days , and sweet talkin ' hippie . this follow up travelers and thieves cd has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes . as talented as the instrumentalists might be , after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present . all in the groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody . mountain cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between john popper and guest , greg allman . in time i could appreciate it a bit more . onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic . however , the overall impression is that of boredom . the tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality . even popper 's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this cd . the discriminating fan will choose the first cd , four , and straight until morning and pass on this mess .
