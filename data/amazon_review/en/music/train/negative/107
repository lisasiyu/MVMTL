mediocre music with horrible vibrato the first time i heard about antony and the johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about rufus wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible . i decided to do some investigating about this antony at a local barnes & noble and what i discovered was very , very dissapointing . i find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well , but antony 's voice is very over the top and fake . by fake , i mean his use of vibrato , which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike ( not natural ) . professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed : five to six vibrations per second . it is evident that antony 's `` trained '' sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm . another thing about this band and record that i find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs . the artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings . the lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening , which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this . my conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons ... and help
