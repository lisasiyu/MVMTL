below neal schon 's standard i am pro-neal schon . i own many of his solo efforts and every journey album to date . however , i honestly ca n't understand why everyone is rating this album with 5 stars . it simply does not meet the mark on this one . none of the tracks have a theme that will 'grab ' you . these are n't songs that will stick in your head . saying that this album is 'neal exploring his melodic side ' is pretty inaccurate . if want to hear neal 's 'melodic side , ' by `` beyond the thunder ... . '' one of his best to date . these tracks are him basically exploring his improvisational side and jamming to a drum machine . even live drum tracks by a great drummer such as omar hakim sound as if they are programmed . i was disappointed on this one . neal is an exceptional guitarist ... .one of the best in the world . he just did n't hit the mark on this one .
