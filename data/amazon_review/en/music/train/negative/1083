sacrilege to compare with 80 's legend bands . to compare this with the smiths the furs and the cure.. ? is a sacrilege . it is far from those bands , not remotely in their league , and not even close to their sound.. its lite bouncy uninspired pop . which is fine , but please be honest with musical comparisons , perhaps listen to the refered bands before using them as a reference
