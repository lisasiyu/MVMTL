catchy at first , but angst fades with age ... i read in manson 's bio that the singer for this band was a groupie of his . and it shows . this cd is a clean , more innocent version of manson 's first cd . her voice is nice and catchy , but the content wont appeal to many peole over the age of 16 . this was a cd that was made to get quick appeal and then fade away just as fast
