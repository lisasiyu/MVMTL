yeah this isnt a good hits album ... all of the songs on this album are very good , however it does n't live up to standards . sublimes a much better band than this album shows . if your a casual fan , i would not recomoned this to start . instead , i 'd recomend `` 40 oz . to freedom '' thats my personal favorite sublime album . it may not have all the hits on it , but is much better than robbin the hood and self-titled . great songs , terrible compilatio
