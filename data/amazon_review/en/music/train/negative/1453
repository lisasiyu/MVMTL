this is more about the amazon seller doolicity than the cd ! beware of the seller doolicity i enjoy the band cracker and have no issues with their releases . i just wanted to make a note to potential buyers , if you are buying used do not use the amazon seller doolicity . i have ordered from them several times and every single time they come in as the slowest of all sellers ! ! ! i wo n't endorse who i think is good but i just left the 10th negative feedback for doolicity and hope i can save many frustration when buying cd 's from artist
