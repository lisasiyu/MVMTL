does some good pickin ' and a grinnin ' ! steve martin has become a cultural staple in the comic community . with hysterical films and outlandish saturday night live performances , it would be obvious that martin would be a great choice to do a comic album . well , in this film guys opinion , you are going to need to be a big fan of martin to stomach this album . his humor is offbeat , never quite following a pattern or direction . instead of actual jokes , he resorts to making noises on the album that i am sure are funny in person , but listening to it just comes off a failure . his `` cat handcuffs '' bit is humorous , but the rest becomes obvious that somebody was looking to cash in on martin 's popularity . i would have loved to see steve martin in concert during his younger days , i am sure that he would make me laugh my socks off , but it just does n't translate well to day 's style . i am sorry steve , but i liked your other album better . grade : ** out of ****
