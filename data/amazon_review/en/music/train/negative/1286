nostalgic , wimpy pop i grew enamored with eric carmen 's music , drawn in by not only the many honest , complicated emotions of his first two solo albums ( especially boats against the current ) but also by the occasionally hard-hitting pop of the raspberries . i got away from carmen 's work for a long time , but recently have been relistening to the old lp 's and gave change of heart a spin . after hearing it again , i was surprised at three things . first , most songs seemed half-baked , with the chorus on most making a quick appearance and then repeating endlessly . these are short songs , devoid of development and any compositional reach . second , the production seemed both overdone and timid at the same time . overdone in the all-star backing musicians ( danny kortchmar ! leland sklar ! nigel olsson ! burton cummings ! jeff porcaro ! ) playing very simple stuff . overdone in the too-thick orchestration . timid like the hand claps and piano glissandos on `` hey deanie '' and other examples throughout the album . finally , i was surprised by the brevity . only 8 tunes , with a syrupy orchestral variation on the title track . again , underlining the overall theme of an uninspired , tired work
