`` the best of ... '' ? ..as compared to what ? this item is billed as `` the best of `` shatner and nimoy..now i really do have to wonder about the use of the word '' best '' here ... neither shatner nor spock can sing , so this album exists as a goof ... but there really is n't anything funny about the material contained on this disc ... indeed , since at the time it was recorded both performers took themselves and thier efforts very seriously , the sides on this album were never intended as joke material..the fact that they have become joke material still does not excuse the fact than any of these sides , by either of these two actors , were ever recorded ... now i like a good joke when i hear one , as well as the next guy , and i appreciate comic tunes , but the dull , tedious , often over-wrought balderdash that is to be found on this album stupefies rather than entertains ... getting back to the use of the word '' best '' as a descrition of what is contained on this album ... if this stuff is the '' best '' that either man is capable of i can only shudder at the thought of what the stuff left off this compilation must sound like ... '' best '' ... as in the '' best '' manure the cow has to offer ? ..as in it 's `` best '' to shoot oneself in the head rather than endure these tunes ? or maybe `` best '' as in it would be `` best '' to avoid wasting your hard-earned money on this flapdoodle ... .that is a use of the word `` best '' that is appropriate ... .
