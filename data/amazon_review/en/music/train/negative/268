cars suck , acdc suck , boston suck , and steve miller suck the cars have to be one of the most overrated bands of all time . they have only made 1 decent song in bye bye love . rest of their songs just plain suck . i mean why do people love lousy bands in queen , cars , acdc , beatles , stones , who , steve miller , and boston ? good bands are required to be dire straits , foreigner , guns n ' roses , nirvana , green day , aerosmith , and joe walsh . do n't read the 5 star reviewers for this terrible compilation . go get a better album from nirvana insted . ps the cars suck
