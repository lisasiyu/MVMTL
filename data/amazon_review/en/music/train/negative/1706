the worst of ofra haza . having bought shaday and kirya by miss haza , i bought desert wind with the notion that it would be as fantastic as the aforementioned . boy was i wrong . gone are the heavy yemenite/israeli beats and flavor , as is haza singing in hebrew . instead , i found her beautiful voice swallowed up by abhorrent 80 's synth-pop cheese and benal lyrical content , with hebrew only in the chorus at most . there is not a single song , with the exception of `` slave dream '' that i could bear to listen to all the way through , and most of the songs are laughably bad . so , fans of haza 's other works , do yourself a favor and save your [ money ] and buy shaday or kirya . unless you want a good laugh , then by all means , purchase away
