yawn . nickel creek fans , obviously , will love this syrupy solo album by the guitarist of the aforementioned famed popgrass fusion band . presumably this mostly-instrumental outing is intended to demonstrate watkins ' chops as a picker , yet it follows so closely in the saccharine tradition of nickel creek that it does n't do much to differentiate his work from theirs . the album opens with & quot ; neo 's song , & quot ; which sounds like a watered-down version of tony rice 's note-bending flatpicking style ; the rest of the album gets progressively muzak-ier and windham hill-ish . watkins has lots of technical facility , but his artistic instincts are hopelessly bland
