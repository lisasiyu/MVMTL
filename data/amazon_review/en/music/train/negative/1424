is hed kandi over ? if you were waiting for ministry of sound to ruin hed kandi well then here it is . thankfully i have n't brought this . after hearing this compilation it is very clear that hed kandi is over . the only cd that 's any good is the 3rd one and that 's cause it 's full of hed kandi classic 's which i 've already herd a million times ... . do n't waste your money . if you 've already brought any ministry of sound cd 's this year then do n't bother cause if you have n't grown sick of hearing the same tracks from the last year on radio then you will be after hearing this . reserve your listening time for something worth while . quality is n't a word i 'd use to discribe this compilation at all..
