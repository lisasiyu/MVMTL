what am i missing ? ? ? i hate this cd . i have most of the other chieftan cd 's , and their collaboration with other artists has always worked in the past . this collection runs the gamut from mediocre to ludicrous . to paraphrase a line from spinal tap : & quot ; there 's a fine line between clever and stupid. & quot ; this one 's over the line . & quot ; tears of stone & quot ; is my current fave
