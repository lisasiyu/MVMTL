blue october.. instead . is it true that the lead singer for hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated ? his voice sounds so . the way he sings `` lips of an angel '' makes me want to punch him in the face ! i 'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group . i seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before i heard the chorus !
