boring , but she has a nice voice i thought the album was boring . i did n't watch nashville star but i 'm a big country music fan and i like to listen to new artists . i bought the cd and loved the catchy song `` i break things '' . the other songs really did n't grab me , even after several listens . i was disappointed in her cover of `` i 'm not lisa '' - although erika jo has a beautiful voice , i found the rendition lacking emotion . she 's a good singer but i hope her next album has some better material
