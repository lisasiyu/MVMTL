atmosphere is emo-rap let me start by saying that i thought that atmosphere 's early albums were much better ( most of atmosphere 's current fans have no idea that they had other albums ... ) but seven 's travels is slug and ant 's transformation into a crappy sell-out group , and the first ever emo-rap group . the people that love this album are always some teenager , usually some emo-kid , who decide they like rap and atmosphere after hearing this album . they jump onto the official atmosphere bandwagon , but dont think that they listen to rap ... they listen to `` rap '' . these emo-rap kids love to talk about how much mainstream rap sucks and how much better atmosphere is , and how underground is the best . ( dont think from this that i am a fan of mainstream rap , i 'm just explaining ) the number one sign you can tell from , even by just looking at these reviews , is if they start talking about how mainstream sucks ( naturally , these teenage kids like to be different , and ca n't stop talking about it ) or how this is real true rap music . so , basically , these kids are part of the underground hip-hop backpacking club who love the only atmosphere album they 've ever heard , sevens travels and live out their little emo lives listening to atmosphere ( for about 3 months ) . even if these people listen to atmosphere 's other albums ( which would totally make them the ultimate atmosphere super-fan ! ) it makes no difference because atmosphere is a crappy emo-rap group now . the purpose of this is to inform people that listen to real hip-hop that this album is not for them and that its for emotionally-disturbed teenagers . go buy some real hip-hop , and we can all let the emo-kids cry themselves to sleep listening to sevens travels
