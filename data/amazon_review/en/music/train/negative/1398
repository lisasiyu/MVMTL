what was she thinking ? ! ! ! perhaps i 'm just getting old , and maybe i just have such a special place in my heart for dionne 's recordings from earlier in her career , but this recording just does n't cut it . i understand the necessity and the desire to `` update '' old hits from one 's singing career to make them `` sing '' to a new generation of listeners , but there is an annoying sameness to each song . the electronic instruments dominate way too much , particularly the percussion . where 's an acoustic piano ? not one horn ? not even a small string section ? this must have been a pretty low budget project . if you are a dionne warwick fan or are eager to listen to her music for the first time , first go back to her recordings from the 60 's . then try some of her music from the `` heartbreaker '' and `` deja vu '' period . but do n't waste your money on this one . i hope dionne 's next project has a bit more imagination and better instrumental arrangements .
