elvis crapello i do n't know . i loved ec and i loved country ... i even went to see him on the tour afterwards ... what a waste of my precious time back then ... and of my money . this is self-indulgent and badls played ... i do not understand the point really . buy some real country instead ... george jones , johnny cash , anything instead..
