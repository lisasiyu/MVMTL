beyond belief ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..and stupidity ! ! first of all , the delivery man is n't that much of an album . why would anyone want a bonus disc of bad remixes or live versions ? ? ? you folks are right - this reissuing business is just plain stupid . i 've been a costello fan for over 25 years , but i 'll tell you what , my collection stopped at the ryko reissues ! as for the stuff he 's put out since the universal switch - i 've burned them all off the copies that my local library system gets ( at least one person on their buying staff is a costello fan - ai n't i lucky ? ) . sorry e , but i spent too much of my ( and other people 's ) money on buying these `` elusive '' rare tracks - that are still in print all these years later . i 'll believe this stuff is rare when rhino ceases the bonus discs and just reissues the old catalog in their original 11-20 song discs . in the meantime , i 've got a box of old costello 45s and picture sleeves for sale . any takers
