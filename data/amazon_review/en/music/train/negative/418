average at best the corrs are good at what they do..trad-orientated pop , but on this album , i feel that they have lost their way a little . always difficult to follow a 'talk on corners ' , but this album is just average , at best . there are some nice tracks here like 'all the love in the world ' , 'radio ' and 'breathless ' but apart from these , nothing else really rises to the challenge . lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others
