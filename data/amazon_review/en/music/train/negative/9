zzzzzzzzzzz i 've always seen sheryl crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist . my wife and i got a couple of her disc 's , plus that `` very best of '' cd and was really looking forward to her latest , but this one ... zzzzzzzz , makes me wonder what they 're putting in sheryl 's coffee . some reviewers are saying there 's `` heart and soul '' all over this album ? that may be , but it 's also very slick dullsville stuff too . as for the album cover graphics , i do n't see the roger dean yes covers or the 60 's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote , but a very `` modern '' graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using . kelly clarkson , the vines , the donnas , the list goes on . highlights : good is good ( i guess it 's time for a new `` very best of '' collection )
