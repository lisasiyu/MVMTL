i got what i expected i recieved this cd as a present , not thinking much about it since its southern rap this cd has almost no lyrical talent the reason i gave it 2 stars , is because i enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the neptunes . like almost all southern rap now , its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent . so if your one of those clueless kids that like rap ( mainstream rap ) i would say you could possible enjoy this cd
