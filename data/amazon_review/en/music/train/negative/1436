not worth the time or money puddle of mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000 . this album is representative of their entire catalogue . for those music fans who want to hear true hard rock , pick up a good copy of any early led zeppelin or black sabbath . for anyone wanting true grunge , pick up any copy of an alice in chains , soundgarden , or nirvana album . puddle of mudd shamelessly ( and inaccurately ) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge , while living up to neither . since most of their fans seem to be pretty young , they 've been able to pull this sham off , mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands ... and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music . the songs on this album are extremely redundant , with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next . the lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content . this album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock
