i ca n't take it ! i got these cds based on some reviews , but i can not take the singing . there are far too many little kids singing , and the adults are no better . it is way too gimmicky . if you want just traditional songs sung nicely , this is not the set for you ! i am going to copy the songs i like and make my own cd - i think there are maybe 2 songs per cd i 'll use ! bad
