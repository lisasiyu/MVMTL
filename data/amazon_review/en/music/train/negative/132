more horrible rap ... as if fiddy cent was n't enough to make me break some bones , this horrible trend of kayne west comes in . what is there to be said that has n't been said ? nothing , really ; my work has been done by all the one-star reviewers . all i have to say is that i hope this rapper fades away from the universe sooner or later . want good rap ? go for tupac ( r.i.p . ) or public enemy
