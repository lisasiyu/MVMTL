sanctimonious crap steve albini has got to be the most sanctimonious , self-possessed , pompous [ person ] in the entire music industry . he emerges in one hysterically pretentious band after another . he 's hailed as some sort of guru by `` alternative '' people , when he 's actually nothing but an uninformed , homophobic piece of **** . in the song `` jordan , minnesota '' he slanders innocent parents for molesting their children even though the true story is all over the net . ever heard of research , steve ? guess not , you 've probably been too busy sleeping with prostitutes and pissing on other bands equipment ( yeah , i read the tour diary ) . as for the `` music '' , this is a record by and for people who hate music
