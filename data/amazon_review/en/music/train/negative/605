looks like sting is loosing his touch wow , i sampled the songs on this new cd and i really am surprised at the drop in quality and uniqueness sting used to bring to the music . like deniro and pacino . where are they now ? doing comedy and bland movies . not like the movies of yester-year when they were top notch . stings voice is still among the best in the world , just the music behind him is what makes his cds bland and uninteresting . i mean , techno and rap . it 's like a mundane chant , much like the sting of the past used to sing out about . it looks like the music industry of today is not only responsible for some of the most uninteresting music and groups it 's also consuming those that used to be the best . it 's really a shame to see an artist like sting decline in his work . brand new day was the start . although it was n't all bad , but you got the sense that he was lost or beginning to lose his way and his style . oh , well , albums like `` ten summoner 's tale '' , `` nothing like the sun '' , `` soul cages '' , and `` dream of the blue turtles '' were the best of his solo career . now , he 's just earning a paycheck . farewell sting . it was nice knowing you
