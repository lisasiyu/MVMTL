`` can she excuse my wrongs ? '' probably not ... while i have no doubt of sting 's genuine admiration and love for dowland 's music , the performances here simply will not do . he has obviously learned the notes very carefully , and he does make it through each of these challenging songs ... but just barely . never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations . the entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly `` note-for-note '' in its approach . to be fair , subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close `` pop '' miking of sting 's voice , which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist edin karamazov were n't even in the same room when performing . moreover , sting 's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible . add to this sting 's hokey `` masterpiece theatre '' -style readings from a letter of john dowland to sir robert cecil , chief adviser to elizabeth i , and some ill-advised multitracking effects , and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable . in which case , i wo n't carp about the disc 's rather meager running time of 48 minutes , since even at that short measure , it seems much longer . i 'm just glad i did n't shell out for the disc ; i borrowed it from my local lending library , and it goes back at the end of the week
