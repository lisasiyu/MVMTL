a memory in the early 1970 's rolling stone magazine did a piece on roy buchanan , the late , and great , guitarist . roy once turned down an offer to play with the stones . ry cooder was nearby , overheard the interview , and began a rant about the stones and mick jagger in particular . ry was quoted saying , as i recall , that , though keith did n't attend the `` jamming with edward '' session , the tape was rolling . ( if memory serves , ry said that keith left the session , supposedly , according to ry , in order not to appear to be riff hunting . ) ry said the stones `` stole '' his sound and riffs . he said `` honky tonk woman '' was an example of this `` ripoff . '' in my opinion the signature guitar riff of this tune is definitely ry 's style . ry also was disdainful of mick 's so called `` devil '' persona . he thought it absurd that a twerp ( my word but i think i 'm accurately depicting ry 's attitude towards mick ) like mick could be considered `` satanic . '' later , when ry 's disgust became evident to mick and he prepared to fly back to the states , ry said mick asked him what was wrong and did he want more money . i think ry wanted less bs from mick and company .
