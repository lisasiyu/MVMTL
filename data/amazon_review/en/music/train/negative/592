southern gospel ? nightclub ? what is she doing ? there is a hint that jessica has a good voice , but apparently she is not sure where she belongs . some of the songs have a southern gospel feel , and i must confess , that personally , i do not like that wailing type of music . but , if you do , you will like some of the tracks . however , on other tracks , she uses this breathy quality , that i suppose , is trying to imitate a sexy nightclub singer . these two styles do not work well together . except for die-hard jessica fans , this is not a particularly good album . it is ho-hum pop and even less attractive as christmas music . at times i am reminded of marilyn monroe singing `` happy birthday , mr . president . '' the problem is that marilyn was not known as a singer . jessica needs to rethink her presentation . only buy this album if you think jessica is the greatest thing since edison invented the light bulb .
