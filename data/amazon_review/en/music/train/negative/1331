extra cheese i bought this cd because this band is from my home town and i 've heard good things about them.i hate to have to bash my own city but if these guys are the best vegas has to offer i do n't see much hope for our rock scene.this band is no different from most of the other bands you hear on the nu-rock stations.it reminds me of 70 's bubble gum pop.sure some of the songs are catchy , but in a david cassidy sort of way.the singer sounds like he should be working on the vegas strip as a cher impersonator instead of attempting to sing in a rock band.the drummer is boring.his style is rigid , and it lacks soul.the guitar players riffs are flat and uncreative . every song is about a girlfriend , or breaking up with a girlfriend ... nothing special here.it 's todays glam rock , nothing more ... save your cash
