krs 's weakest entry into his library i have always been a huge fan of kris parker . i like what krs has done . i like what he is doing . i like the fact that he has never looked to what the masses are putting out and has instead tried from day one to promote positivity . therefore , i find that this effort is laudable in its attempt to bring krs 's spirituality to an audience that has been listening to him for decades . unfortunately , it falls flat on its face . the songs on this album do not manage to live up to the message in the lyrics . krs is best known for bringing a message to all people by writing about things that could be understood by all people . that aspect of his work is forgotten on this album , and his work comes across as his preaching instead of his teaching . it 's almost like he 's forgotten the experiences that brought about his spirituality , and instead focuses on the goal without paying attention to the trials and tribulations that got him there . musically , the beats are mostly just plain terrible , and feel devoid of warmth or personality . the lyrics feel forced and while his delivery is excellent , the writing is not up to his usual high standard . most rappers these days are known for the beats they put together , or the hooks of their songs . few are known for true lyrical ability . krs has never before fallen victim to this trap . the reason criminal minded , boom bap and necessary did so well was the mix of good writing , excellent delivery and beats that worked with the material presented . everyone who listens to hip hop can quote lyrics from those albums ( and many , if not most , of krs 's other offerings ) - the same ca n't be said with this album , as he did n't find the right mix to present the material . pick up this album if you want a complete krs one collection - otherwise , leave it on the shelf
