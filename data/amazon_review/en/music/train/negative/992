this cd sucked this is sabotage rather than a tribute to tupac . this does n't do him justice . listening to this cd , i thought of `` this is spinal tap '' - the part where they have the miniature version of stonehenge , and everyone is looking around thinking `` what the hell is going on ? '' that must have been how tupac felt at this show . the part of the cd where you can actually hear someone flipping through `` all eyez on me '' trying to find the right song ... that was when i knew this cd was crap . tupac put great pride into the quality and sound of his work . this is an abomination . well , what more can you say ? death row needed a little extra holiday bling , i guess ... . my recommendation - do n't buy it . you might as well just listen to all eyez on me and sing along .
