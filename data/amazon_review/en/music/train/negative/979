stunning technique , needs much work this performer deserves all the latitude necessary , as she may yet develop into a relevant , insightful , and original interpreter of the music she offers . i truly hope she does not choose to compete with eliot fisk in the indy-500 or the 24-hours of le mans . based on the samples , i wo n't be buying this cd as i can program my computer to play just as fast or even faster , and just as clear . instead , i recommend the frank bungarten recording ( also available on amazon ) . but ana vidovic does show a lot of promise , and deserves encouragement
