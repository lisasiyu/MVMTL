very disappointed . i grew up listening to her `` in concert '' album , and bought the pearl album based on reviews saying this was a more mature style for her music . i like her old style better , this sounds like she was trying to make a more pop sound for her music ( although the singing was n't much different ) . it not only did n't sound like what you expect from janice joplin , it sounded like a muzak imitation of her
