worst band album unless one considers `` planet waves , '' dylan 's 1974 studio album with the band playing backup , to be a band album , `` cahoots '' has no competition for the title of the worst band album ever . yes , the first two tracks are good ( `` life is a carnival '' - great rhythms , great horns , ok lyrics ; and dylan 's `` masterpiece '' -- does nothing for me , but i understand many people love it ) , but they are available on other compilations , so the reason to shell out for `` cahoots '' has to reside in the remaining tracks if anywhere , and they are awful . the songs , that is , not the performances . the boys sing and play as well as ever , but their efforts -- particularly some fine danko vocals and hudson horn playing -- are wasted on songs that are utterly tuneless , charmless and brainless . there is not a single memorable musical phrase on tracks 3-11 . nor do the bonus tracks on this reissue rescue the enterprise : all are either available elsewhere in equivalent or superior versions or are unworthy of inclusion on anything ( a radio commercial ? ! ) . save your money for any of the worthier products of this wonderful group of musicians
