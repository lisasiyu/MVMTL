largely unessential remixes . `` things falling apart '' is the remix album that followed `` the fragile '' , and is remixes of material from that record . after the high standard set by `` further down the spiral '' , i had lofty expectations , and that could be effecting my opinion of this one , i largely found that this album falls short of its predecessor in all ways . it could be the choice of material -- largely sticking to the song forms , i think the remixers missed an opportunity to really place with something atmospheric and create something unique -- i mean , did we really need three versions of `` starf***ers , inc '' ? i find the original to be subpar , and remixing a weak song is n't going to produce a strong one , regardless of the efforts sherwood , oglivie , and clouser put into their remixes . ditto for hillibrandt 's take on `` the wretched '' -- its not one of the stronger pieces on the record . and where 's the remixes of `` we 're in this together '' or instrumentals like `` just like you imagined '' or `` complication '' ? this material has a depth and detail to it that suggest it could well receive a remix . now mind you , its not all bad on here , reznor and moulder 's reconstruction , `` the great collapse '' ( pulling in samples from at least a couple songs and layering them on top of a good beat ) is very listenable , benelli 's remix of `` the frail '' as a string piece may surpass the original in terms of delicate beauty , and the cover of gary numan 's `` metal '' is fantastic . but overall , this is somewhat of a weak effort
