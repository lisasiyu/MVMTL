what happened part 1 i was very dissapointed in this release , especially compared to their past efforts . not a single song stood out on this , nothing different than the 76432714 other power metal carbon copy bands out there . if you 're a fan of `` glory to the brave '' , `` legacy of kings '' or even the `` renagade '' album just end it there , this is not worth ruining the vision of a once good band .
