overblown & quot ; artistic freedom & quot ; atlantic records sure must be loose w/ their recording contracts . i do n't see how this kind of drivel , regardless of the musicians ' past records and reputations , could pass a demo test w/ stingy studio execs . this cd was simply self-indulgent and wasteful . froom is incapable of just playing keyboards , w/out trying to overunderproduce a piece to the point of absurdity . atmospheric just do n't cut it if there 's no compelling content to hold it up . and where 's that killer guitar talent we know/knew in hidalgo ? just a strange , disjointed , and goofy effort with no real payoff
