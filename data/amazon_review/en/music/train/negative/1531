replacements soundtrack i would have ordered this soundtrack except i actually took the time to check out the list of `` songs '' that were on it and to read a couple of the reviews . sure enough , it was exactly as i thought myself ... .there was only one song that i actually recognized from the movie itself , gloria gaynor 's `` i will survive '' , which is a good song , but not even close to all the other great songs which were in the movie itself , but not in the actual `` soundtrack '' ! what 's up with that ? ? ? great movie , great songs , should have a great soundtrack that is available to the fans , but it does not . too bad . i understand that the person who wrote the actual `` musical score '' for the movie wants his due , but the fans want `` their '' music , too . do the fans not have a right to what they actually expect on the soundtrack of a movie ?
