ummmm ... .sorry , this one is n't very good . yeah , i bought this cd because i heard she is one of the better drum n ' bass djs ... .and she 's really damn cute . problem is ... this cd is n't very good at all . trying to go too main stream popish , some of the lyrics are laughable , there is n't a single song on this cd that would make it into one of my sets . i 'm sure she 's a very good dj , but someone led her down the wrong road this time
