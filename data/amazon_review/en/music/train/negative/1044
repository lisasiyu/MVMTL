no special talent for music if axiom of choice have a great talent , it 's for getting their music fairly widely known . but a lot of the music on this cd sounds like an absent-minded jam anyone could have in their garage with a friend . there 's some richer music on this cd , a song or 2 , but not really . for music like this , i recommend other people such as vas , rasa , stellamara , & amp ; even loreena mckennitt
