dan the automator ruins it . galactic decided to go with a big-name producer named dan the automator . dan the automator took an amazing , explosive , quirky funk sound and gutted it of any soul it had . i 'm sure these songs sound good live , that is without dan the automator 's overproduction and mixing ( drum machines over stanton moore ? for shame ! the horror ! ) . the album itself is flat except for a few high points - `` paint '' is good , `` the beast '' is funky enough , `` never called you crazy '' is good , and `` all behind you now '' is a great song , or would be live . that 's about it . the rest of the album varies from so-so to outright boring , and considering the amazing amount of talent dan the automator had to work with in galactic that 's a crime . crazyhorse mongoose and late for the future are both far superior records
