one of the worst bands of all time ! alright , i will state that i was curious about this band about four years ago . i thought to myself : `` good charlotte ca n't be that bad if they have so many 'hardcore ' fans that go everywhere , buy everything and speak anything that is to do with good charlotte . '' man , was i wrong . good charlotte sucks . they 're basically a boy band that wears black clothes and wears eyeliner . their music sounds like sped up emo music . you could describe their music as `` emo with estrogen '' . mtv markets them to the teenybopper crowd . how so many young , impressionable kids can get suckered hook , line , and sinker into any of the garbage that this pathetic excuse of a band dumps onto them is beyond me . they definitely appeal to 12 year old kids , who have such a horrible life because they ca n't go to the mall and buy new clothes or get a new video game . they are a whiny band that love to sing about how `` horrible '' and `` tragic '' their life is , meanwhile they are sitting in cash in their mansions . no one cares except for their legions of self-pitying fans who feel they can truly connect with gc 's `` deep '' and `` inspiring '' so-called `` music '' . they even have whiny ballads that sound like the rest of the `` pop-punk '' and `` emo '' genres at the moment . yeah , gc is fuelled by teen angst and armed with extremely bad talent . i 'm sorry kiddies but good charlotte is nothing more than pop . i 'm 16 & i 'm already getting tired of the new music because it is getting horrible & more horrible . it 's a manufactured popularity contest now . with their mediocre cliched song lyrics , good charlotte are 100 % worshipped by their demographic , pre-teen and teenage preppy girls ( and flamer guys . ) this group of pop icons do nothing more than create crappy music ( which is charged to audiences at well over $ 50 per ticket ) and find themselves on mtv acting like jackasses every chance they aquire for the pleasure of their braindead viewers . their fanbase consists of 12 year olds that think they know all about music , therefore claim that they have the right to say that `` gc '' are musical gods or are the `` best punk rawk band eva ! 111 ! 1 ! `` , while talented bands like the beatles and pink floyd to them are `` old '' and `` horrible '' . these 12 year olds can usually be found online , usually on message boards , with usernames like `` xxgcisdabestpunkbandevarxx '' and `` tru3_punk_rawk3r '' . conversations between members of their fan base may be similar to this : poser : i love good charlotte they 're so punk they 're so much cooler than all those other pop bands . kid # 2 : where did you hear them first ? poser : trl , oh , and in hot topic . poser : hey , wan na , like , go to a good charlotte concert next month ? poser 2 : yeah ! and we can wear our studded bracelets and red and black pants that we bought at hot topic ! teenybopper talking to herself : `` oh my gaaaawd . i hate my liiiife . i can relate to these guys sooooo much because nobody listens to me and everyone hates meee '' ugh . in the end , i recommend the following punk rock albums to those who have been victimized by good charlotte : raw power - iggy and the stooges ramones - the ramones london calling - the clas
