sooooooooooooo disappointing ! ! ! do n't buy it . buy his first cd instead ! i loved marques houston in immature/imx . his first solo cd was good . he 's a decent actor as well . this cd , however , does not match up at all with other stuff he 's done . all because of u and naked were good songs ( and naked was a good video ; ) ) i think there was one other good song - but , i sold this cd to a used cd store about 2 weeks after i got it . i couldnt even listen to most of the songs all the way through . boring . vulgar language . mh is just trying too hard by using the n-word a lot and talking dirty . sex music can be classy - but not on his cd . i was soooooooooooooooo disappointed with this piece of crap cd . do not buy it ! ! ! !
