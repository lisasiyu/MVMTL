rubbish yo , do n't take this the wrong way because i 'm not a hater but rather a big biggie fan . but this album is terrible . its nothing but easy money for greedy producers by using old biggie verses and whipping up new beats . biggie certainly did n't leave very much unreleased material unlike tupac then again i suppose he was n't expecting he was going to die . but they still should n't do s*** like this . if you want to support biggie 's legacy this year which is n't a bad idea , pick up one of the classics - ready 2 die or life after death .
