mcgee & quot ; slaughters & quot ; album with edward mcgee 's whiny vocal arrangements coupled with lyrics such as , & quot ; i ca n't stand to see the slaughter , but still i eats the meat & quot ; , this album 's & quot ; chops & quot ; are nothing but mindless butchery . the torture continues with sappy tracks like & quot ; you ought to be having fun & quot ; and & quot ; make someone happy & quot ; . what would truly make me happy is throwing this album into a bonfire and roasting it to a crisp , golden brown . eating this tainted & quot ; meat & quot ; will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth . bon appetite
