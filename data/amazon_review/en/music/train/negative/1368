`` what is this ... .. ? '' o.k . when i heard that dave was going to remaster/re-release the megadeth back catalog i got real excited . i still believe that this album is a true masterpiece , but when i bought the 2004 remaster/remixed version i was mortified ! ! ! ! what was dave thinking when he decided to remix it . all it needed was to be beefed up just a little , but he went to great extremes to ruin it . i know megadeth fans were pretty pissed about this , but the one thing i did remember is that the first time i heard countdown ... when it was release in 1992 it gave me chills ... ... ..period ! i have regrets about buying all the remasters at once ... ... .big mistake ! ! ! so in closing i went back and found the original versions of so far ... so good ... so what ! , rust in peace , and of course countdown to extinction , and yes capitol punishment ... the megadeth years . i 'm glad that i was able to locate them
