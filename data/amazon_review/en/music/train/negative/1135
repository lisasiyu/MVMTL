pull my finger ... see above for reviews that pinpoint some of the problems with this album . production quality ( or uniquely bad production choices ) , lack of musical enthusiasm , appalling lack of catchy tunes or lyrics from a band i thought had true capabiities -- pick the flaw that bugs you the most . any way you slice it this album is a stinker . better luck next time cyhsy . ( your first album was gold . ) consumers : make sure to listen to those samples before you buy this one . if you are looking for more great songs like the ones on their first effort then this is n't it . i 'm convinced that the band knew what they had made this time around and that the title , `` some loud thunder , '' must be a witty , veiled reference to flatulence .
