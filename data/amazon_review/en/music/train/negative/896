where 's the beef ? in the 70 's there was american british and canadian rock . its a shame that most living outside of canada did n't get an opportunity to hear a lot more of the canadian product . my biggest beef with all of the april wine `` greatest hits '' compilations was the fact that most of the rocking early years has been largely ignored . who put these compilations together ? where was lead singer/songwriter/guitarist myles goodwyn during all of this ? where is `` fast train , bad side of the moon , drop your guns , electric jewels , weeping widow , just like that , you could have been a lady , anything you want , victim for your love , forever for now , cat 's claw , come on along , the band has just begun '' etc etc etc ? the albums `` electric jewels , on record and stand back '' as well as `` live at the el mocambo '' are much more representative of april wine . canada rocked , we really did . you just would n't know it from this pap .
