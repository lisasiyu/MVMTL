a disappointment the sacd recording of derek and the domino 's layla is a disappointment to say the least . i have recently begun listening to several sacd and dvd-audio recordings and this sound mix offers nothing new to the previous recordings . this is one of rock 's best offerings and the sound on this sacd offers no improvement to the mix of eric clapton and duane allman 's guitar work . a major letdown .
