money is an issue , but not that much . pitbull 's 3rd album from the 2004 m.i.a.m.i brings something at least different , though not much else , despite some good beats and some good songs , pitbull is just flat and distorted . this is a somewhat album music rating **1/2 stars . so a marginal thumbs down for me .
