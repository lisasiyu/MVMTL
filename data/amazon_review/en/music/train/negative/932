watch out ! not the originals this album features 70s re-recordings of et 's hits . his texas troubodors at the time were a good band , but ernest 's voice had coarsened quite a bit by then . you can now get the original 40s and 50s recordings of ernest 's hits on the hall of fame series . even the 1958 remakes originally on the decca/mca & quot ; greatest hits & quot ; and & quot ; ernest tubb story & quot ; were pretty good ... but this album is for completists only
