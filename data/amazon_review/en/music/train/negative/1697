it 's just a mess ... i disagree with the spotlight reviewer 's assertion that this movie-musical was overproduced ; it seems more to suffer from spartan-like efforts in production . i did enjoy the fact that part of oz was in an urban setting ( i.e. , the subway station ) , but it looked like they did n't even try to clean it up a little . but enough about the movie , this is the soundtrack ... and as i stated above , it 's a mess . this classification mainly rests on the shoulders our `` diva supreme '' diana ross . stephanie mills set the bar high , and miss ross did not even come close to that standard . she was a visible , vocal and emotional failure . her renditions of `` be a lion '' and home '' ( my favorite two songs } were dreadful -- in the latter she even sang incorrect lyrics . she just does not have the talent or ability to effectively communicate dorothy 's character , let alone sing her songs right . i would rate this with zero stars if it were at all possible . however , the two stars are earned by the members of the original cast ( especially mabel king ) and one addition : ms. lena calhoune horne . she was radiant in voice and appearance and brought the level of inspiration and power up a notch as she belted out `` believe in yourself '' . they alone save this movie and album from just being a total misstep . yet , we still have diana ross here absolutely slaughtering the vocals and pathos of dorothy , so all-in-all it 's just a mess
