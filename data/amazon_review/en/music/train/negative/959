unfulfilled promise the mixing on some tracks is awful , and at one point , vocals are lost altogether on the rascals track . i love this music -- the soundtrack of my college days -- so having it on one disc for traveling ( i commute 50 miles round trip every day ) is great , but the quality could be lots better
