soad at its worst that moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true soad fan . ive been a soad fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential . soad was a great album and toxicity was sweet and steal this album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt soad at all . ok in all fairness if i was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully . but compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it , their older stuff was way way better then this crap . and daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and serj is much better
