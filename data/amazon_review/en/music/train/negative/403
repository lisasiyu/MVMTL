vocals make this an unpleasant experience . this album was recommended to me by several different sources , including amazon and my local record store , which had `` mandatory indie classic '' in a sticker on the disc . i tried it out a couple of times and mangum 's voice just takes away from everything else for me . i just could not get into this `` experience '' and traded the disc back in . i agree with the reviewer who says this is not for everybody . if you can get over the vocals , by all means enjoy this album . as for me , the vocals were just too much , or maybe not enough
