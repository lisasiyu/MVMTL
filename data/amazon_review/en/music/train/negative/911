disappointingly cliche and boring unfortunately , perhaps , i am a performing musician ( voice , keyboards , flute , guitar , and a smathering of other instruments ) as well as a composer , and also a fan of fresh , innovative treatments of familiar tunes . i search out and buy two or three new christmas cd 's each year and listen to them non-stop for the month of december . i had great hopes that this liebert cd would be inspiring and was disappointed that it was the opposite . each tune follows the formula of the rhythm section playing a straight-ahead version of whatever song with liebert playing a totally traditional , single-note melody on top , often co-mingled with a couple of motifs from another christmas song . the rhythm section plays the same traditional chord progressions again while liebert & quot ; jams , & quot ; using the same trite , tired riffs . boring
