do n't kid yourself into this purchase i made fun of my best friend so badly when he bought it . honestly , i gave it a chance . we opened it and listened to it for the first time together . but halfway through the worst remix ever crafted by man , it was clear , that i would be making fun of him for his poor purchasing decision , for months to come . this is the worst remix every created . it is long and drawn out and has no merit or quality to it . do n't fool yourself into buying something you will never listen to and will hide from your friends
