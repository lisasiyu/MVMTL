crime boss is a disgrace to suave house this cd is maaad weak . the beats are wack , the lyrics are wack and c.b . is just swinging on eightball and mjg 's fame to get his cd out . by this time this is an oldie but it is as bad today as the day it was released . i would sell mine if i could find anyone to take it
