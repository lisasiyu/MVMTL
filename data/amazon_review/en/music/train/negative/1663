`` lovin ' touchin ' squeezin / city of the angels '' segue-way still not fixed sony botched the 1996 re-master by not preserving the original segue-way that bridged `` lovin touchin squeezin '' and `` city of the angels '' . they have failed to correct this error with this newer , supposedly `` re-masterd '' version . on the original vinyl release , `` city of the angels '' kicked in before the final chorus of `` lovin touchin squeezin '' had completely faded to silence - presenting a similar effect that had been utilized for `` feelin ' that way/anytime '' on infinity . at the time , some aor radio stations even played these two tracks together . as completely seperate tracks on cd , the famous ending of `` lovin touchin squeezin '' becomes clumsy as the final tones of reverb are cut off abruptly . ultimately , it is only a couple seconds cut off ( reverb echoing to silence ) - but as one of journey 's signature tunes , you 'd think that they 'd have taken the time to get it right and preserver the original context of the release . the original ending of 'lovin touchin squeezin '' ( with final seconds of reverb ) can be heard on the two disc collection , essential journey - but of course , as the set is a collection of radio songs , it does not segue into `` city of the angels '' as it originally did ( and should ) on evolution . a minor point i know . but - sony is clearly trying to honor and replicate the original release . they should take the time to check all the details to get it right . or - why bother
