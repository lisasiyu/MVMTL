a top three disappointment this year . kasey 's foray into the pop genre does n't really bother me , and she certainly is n't selling-out either.this release however just does n't have the same quality of songwriting that her three previous country/roots discs had . not much more to say exept that this , along with allison moorer , & randy rogers band are my 3 biggest let-downs of this year
