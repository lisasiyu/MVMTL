stick to live stuff judging by the clips offered from amazon , this cd sounded like it could be as good as gba material , but i was dissapointed after the first spin , and i have n't put it back in since . it 's not bad stuff , just that the jams are lacking in creativity , and the true funk feel is missing . try greyboy allstars ( who are the best live ) , or try the next level in jambads : phish
