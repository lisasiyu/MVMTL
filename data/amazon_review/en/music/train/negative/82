very disappointing i bought this cd because it got a lot of good reviews , and the description sounded like something i would enjoy . however , it turned out to be an atrocious cd . it is very repetitive and monotonous throughout . the songs pretty much all sound the same . there 's little melodic variation , and the vocals have basically no range . the lyrics are extremely uninspired . i 'm glad i bought this used at a cheap price . i do n't know if i 'm going to give it away or just throw it away ; it 's that bad .
