nothing more than a bootleg of poor quality my feelings are very mixed on the live performance by 2pac . but in the end , i feel it is a cd that should be avoided unless you absolutely need everything issued under 2pac 's name . the sound quality is terrible ; it would not rate well if being issued as a bootleg . the cd starts off with a live medley , but drops in about the middle of california love . even the most idiotic bootlegger would not make such a mistake . if you decide to continue listening , it is probably because there is a dearth of live material by 2pac that has found its way to cd . but because of that , why would something of such poor quality be the best for a commercial release ? and at the end of the 40 or so minutes , it becomes obvious ... suge knight was trying one more time to cash in on 2pac 's legacy before his label became totally insignificant . the cd does not have the amaru logo on it , meaning that afeni shakur did not approve the release . but knight 's name is written in bold letters anywhere it can fit . after taking it all in , knight should have done 2pac 's fans a favor and just made an appeal for donations on the internet .
