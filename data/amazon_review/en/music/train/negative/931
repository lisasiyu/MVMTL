o brother bruce , where art thou ? there are two stellar tracks on this : & quot ; mccarran airport , '' sounding like a lost jimmy webb classic , and the wistfully gorgeous & quot ; spring time. & quot ; a quick look at the credits show they 're the only two from the pen of brother bruce . as for the rest -- think kenny g meets h/d/h . sadly , that stands for hallmark/doggerel/hallmark . and that 's too bad , as the vocals and sparse arrangements are right on the money . if there 's to be a follow-up , give bruce free reign
