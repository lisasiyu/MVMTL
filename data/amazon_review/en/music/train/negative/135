mythology as a solution ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? wow ! ! ! this is a horrible album . i really enjoyed comin ' from where i 'm from , so i expected good things from this one right here . wrong . on the title track anthony hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics , then he starts talking about praying . of course mythological-minded cult people are n't worried , they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees . the four subsequent songs are full on jesus songs . people want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason , but they need some kind of cult warning . i would not have purchased this cd had i known it was on some cult mess . in `` preacher 's daughter '' he even says `` a preacher 's daugher so she had common sense . '' i 'm not sure if that 's supposed to be a joke , but common sense should tell one magic people do n't live in the clouds . then `` pass me over '' reminds me of the that two-part skit on ice cube 's lethal injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for jesus and gives ice cube all his stuff , 'cause he thinks jesus will give him new stuff . but anthony hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality . if people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one 's personal problems or the worlds problems then i , for one , am very worried about our future , or probable complete lack there of . that 's a very dangerous mind state . `` sista big bones '' is a good song , but it 's not worth purchasing this
