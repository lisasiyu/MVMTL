this band is horrible . being the fan of the rolling stones i picked up this cd thinking it was something similar . well they do try to emulate the stones sound but fail miserably . they have no originality or heart in their music who ever lets them make cds should be forced to listen to it . if you buy this you are either a masochist or an idiot
