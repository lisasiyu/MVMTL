another disappointment from mos although you get alot of songs for $ 25 , you get a lot of garbage which has been typical from mos in the past two years . the best songs are from the album that features hits from the past . you ca n't really go wrong there . you 'd be better downloading the 10 good songs from itunes and saving $ 15
