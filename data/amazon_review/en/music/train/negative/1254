short as an old 33 1/3 r.p.m . most of these songs are classic , but the disc is too short for it 's own good . clocking in at 35:48 with only 12 songs . ouch ! well , i guess you can look at it like an old 33 1/3 rpm . just hit the pause button after track 6 . take a deep breath or go to the bathroom or fix a drink . then hit the play button . but seriously , there are so many countless trinkets missing from a collection called , `` 20th century masters : the best of the andrews sisters , the millennium collection , '' wow , that 's a bit long winded . but , with a title like that you ought to have rhumboogie , beer barrel polka , well alright , straighten up and fly right , rumors are flying , etc . do n't get me wrong , it 's a nice introduction but just too short . buyer beware ! finally , why ca n't these compilations of old 78 's have a few more seconds between them ? essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together , so why not let them have some breathing room . as i recall , the uk beatles albums from 1963-1966 had a seven second break between songs . i loved it ! it was like giving each song it 's own spotlight . oh , the days of one song at a time .
