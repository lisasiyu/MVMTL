disappointing jim messina has played in a some great bands . he played in the buffalo springfield , a group of young legends . he also played in poco , probably the most under-appreciated and under-rated band of the era . with these credentials , you can put messina 's name up there with the likes of stills , furay , young , nash , crosby , frey and browne . then he teams up with kenny loggins , and things get bad . i picked up this album , expecting greatness from these two , and i simply did n't find it . what i found was two decent tunes surrounded by silly and annoying pop . most songs on here have simple lyrics , and are over-produced . i do like two songs on here . `` till the ends meet '' is a nice , easy tune , and loggins sounds very nice on this one . the other song i like is `` angry eyes . '' the intro is very cool , and the singing interplay between loggins and messina is fun and interesting here . the main point here is that this album does not live up to expectation in the least . there 's no folk , no country rock , no free and easy feeling to this one . this is blatant pop-music . if you like bouncy pop , this might be for you . if you 're looking for anything like poco or buffalo springfield , you will experience a huge bummer .
