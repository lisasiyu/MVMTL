save your money ! ! ! i wish amazon allowed giving `` zero '' stars to an album . i bought my first john & yoko album in 1969 ( `` life with the lions . '' ) i got `` ripped off , '' although i should have know better.. i was smart enough not to buy `` two virgins '' because of the bad reviews . i bought `` life with the lions '' without reading any reviews , but i was young , naive , and a big lennon fan . oh well ! the john & yoko albums released before the breakup of the beatles were all pretty much the same . the chief instigator of these albums seems to be yoko . her background in the `` avant garde '' and `` conceptual art '' is apparent in these albums . the basic premise is : take a `` concept '' and run with it . keep running with it for as long as possible . let 's hear john & yoko call each other by their first names for a half-hour . let 's produce feedback and screaming longer than one can normally tolerate . after all , the big joke is that john lennon 's name is on this album ... so even if the `` concepts '' are questionable and/or idiotic- lots of people will buy this piece of vinyl because a beatle has his name on the cover ! ! ! `` the wedding album '' was the biggest rip-off i ever experienced as a beatles fan and purchaser of all things beatle . when this album came out in 1969 it was priced higher than a regular album because it was a big box ! the graphics for this product had to cost more than the recording costs . the recording part of this project was interminable and amateurish . feel like hearing john & yoko calling each other by their first names for a half hour ? feel like hearing `` home audio '' of every inane bit of their `` bed-in for peace ? '' i sometimes think the most `` conceptual '' thing john & yoko could 've done with this project would have been giving the customer an empty box ! it probably would 've sounded better . buying the cd version of `` the wedding album '' seems bizarre . the product was designed for vinyl and you lose so much graphic presentation in the cd format . the only blessing in the cd version is the inclusion of three actual songs . however , the three actual songs are yoko 's . so maybe it 's not that big a blessing after all . all three tunes were b-sides to plastic ono band singles . i do n't recommend buying any of john & yoko 's `` conceptual '' albums . do yourself a favor and make one of your own ! !
