sure these guys can shred and play fast ... ... ... ... ... but what else can they do ? not a lot else to be honest . so many people have been fooled in to believing this band is amazing simply because of the speed that they play at , but to be honest is speed really everything ? all the songs on the cd lack creativity and sounds pretty much the same as the last song . every fu**ing track on this album is plagued with fast drum beats , some crappy power metal riff that remains throughout the song and lightning fast guitar solos which is impressive when you 've heard one but by the end of the cd its a drag . do n't get me wrong , to be able to play this takes a hell of a lot of skill and ability , but they need to use that skill and ability to come up with something a lot more creative and inventive
