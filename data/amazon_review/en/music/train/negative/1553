wo n't play i ordered two copies of this cd , one for me and one for my daughter . it will not play on my cd player , a technics model . we have never had anything like this happen before . my spouse took the cd to a neighbor 's home and was able to play it on his player . on the strength of that , i gave my daughter her copy . i have no idea whether she has tried to play it or not . my guess is that she wo n't until next christmas . she is overworked and that wo n't be a high priority . in case you are wondering , our cd player continues to work well , playing all our other cds
