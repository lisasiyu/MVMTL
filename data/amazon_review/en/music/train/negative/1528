mediocre singing at best this recording is mediocre at best . while the university of miami chorale is a fantastic choir , it should shy away from certain types of songs . it does n't have the broad range of sounds that the far better byu singers or concordia choir does . 'water night ' is sung well , but not appropriately . this song should be sung without vibrato or it destroys the effect of the setting . the dissonaces that vibrato creates takes away from the beauty of the dissonances that mr. whitacre has written . unfortunately for the listener , vibrato is used in this recording and destroys nearly all of the beauty contained in this wonderful piece . aside from that , the rest of the cd is neither good nor bad . discerning listeners will hear the differences . the music of rene clausen is treated well in this recording , but not understood completely by choir or conductor . if you 're looking for a recording of 'water night ' , unfortunately this is the only one on the mass market right now and sometimes beggars ca n't be choosers so buy at your own risk
