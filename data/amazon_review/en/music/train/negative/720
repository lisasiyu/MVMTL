he needs to get back with paul brown not what i was expecting from him . everyone out there knows boney is a fantastic saxophonist . however , this album left much to be desired . i wonder why he left paul brown , his former producer . he released some excellent albums with paul brown . i do n't think he 's doing well enough on his own . i did not find any track particularly mind-blowing . if anyone that really knows boney doubts this , perhaps you ought to listen to `` seduction '' and `` sweet thing '' before making any comments . this latest album is nothing compared to those two . woork harder boney . i would not advise anyone new to jazz to buy this album .
