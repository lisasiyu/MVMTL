this is what happens when you ditch steve earle your music goes back to sucking . steve earle did n't talk much about car wheels in his autobiography other than to say working with lucinda was a real drag . well , whatever . obviously it produced incredible results and no matter how difficult she is they should look into working together again . because frankly , w/o earle , lucinda williams writes fairly boring songs and puts them to even more boring arrangements . and without lucinda , steve earle does fairly generic country that is rarely worth a second listen . together , they 're awe inspiring . anyway , on to essence : boring songs+boring arrangments+drugged-out singing=bad album . trying to pimp the tracks up with production pixie dust does n't fix the fundamental problem here : the songs are lame . in place of insight we get shopping lists , in place of hooks we get verse , verse , verse . and in place of emotion we get slurred vocals . such ingredients do not make for a good record . as a side note , if you filter by `` most helpful '' you get reviewers who are n't 5-star fanboy clones and write intelligent reviews . most of them were not fooled by this album , no matter how big a fan of lucinda they are . rstj
