thug rap ? ? ? please ... ( 2.5 stars ) a lot of people are meriting ja 's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998 . so he released his sophomore album rule 3:36 in sept 2000 , that is one of the worst ja albums i 've heard ( not the worst , the last temptation takes that title ) . ja tries to be `` gangstafied '' on this album but fails terribly . starting with the first single `` me & you '' thinking his thug style can attract women . i have n't bought the concept in 2000 , and i 'm still not buying it six years later . or how about the flat falling track `` f*** you '' featuring vita and 01 ? or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album , which seriously damages his creditablity . how about the song `` put it on me '' before lil mo joined song . sounds wack ( er ) with out her . or how about the late barry white imitation on the song `` extacy '' ( and thats one of the decent tracks on this album ) . oh and remember when `` between me & you '' was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on napster ? well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded did n't have christina millian singing the hook , but had ja singing it himself . thank god that was n't on the album . now there are some listenable tracks on this album that i would like to point out . `` 6 feet '' is a standout track , and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite . `` watching me '' is another tight track , as ja spits with a load of energy within him . `` i cry '' and as mentioned earlier `` extacy '' are decent at best . other than that , most of the tracks on this album are skippable . overall , a sub medicore ja rule album . most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time ja rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap ( `` put it on me '' [ remix ] ) . to me , this album is nothing else but a pop rap , falsafied thug rap album that just does n't appeal to me . i recommend this to hardcore ja rule fans if they do n't have this already . lyrics : c production : c+ guest appearances : c- musical vibes : d- favorite tracks : watching me , 6 feet , die , extacy honorable mention track : chris black ( skit
