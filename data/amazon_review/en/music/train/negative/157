eh , so so sounds just like the last record if you ask me . always has a great band , arrangements , and mixing , but bob 's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters , old cars , the dustbowl , annie , frannie , sarah , ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with . god bless him
