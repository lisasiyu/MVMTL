why ? ? ? ? i am an honestly big fan of beyonce . i have both of her cds and have always loved destiny 's child . i even love her new song `` beautiful liar '' . but i think that it is illogical for her to re-release this album , escpecially since releasing it in april defeats the purpose of naming the album `` bday '' because her birthday is in september . but still , i ca n't help but love her new song . and i think that she did a great job with shakira . it is an unlikely collabo between two of the most successful artists of the decade , which makes it a great song . but shakira totally steals the spotlight with her stronger voice . i think this track should belong to shakira and she could use it as one of her tracks for her next album
