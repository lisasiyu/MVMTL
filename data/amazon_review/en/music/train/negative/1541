sure sounded like a good idea ... bob dylan 's work has been adapted to all kinds of musical styles , and you 'd think reggae would be a perfect fit , since , like dylan , it often fuses of the spiritual and the political and both dylan and many reggae artists have a fondness for lush but not gooey romantic ballads ( no woman no cry etc ) . but this cd really does n't work for me . i like my reggae rootsy ( as far as i 'm concerned , lee perry is god , or i guess jah ) , and this sounds like slick , soulless beer commercial reggae , the kind of thing you 'd probably hear at a resort pool party . producer doctor dread has a very unfortunate fondness for smooth jazz sax , cocktail lounge guitar and sacharine flutes . it 's all very professional , yes . these are some of the top studio musicians in jamaica ( sly , chinna ) and they hit all the right notes . but they 're just picking up a paycheck . after this session it sounds like they could well have laid down some tracks for a jamaican tourist board spot . some of it is okay . toots is always great , apple gabriel has a wonderful molasses-and-ganja voice , michael rose makes an interesting choice in the lonesome death of hattie carrol and sizzla turns subterannean homesick blues into a dancehall song , which works surprisingly well ( and i do n't like dancehall ) . the cover of got ta serve somebody is pretty good too , partly because it was recorded separately from the rest of the cd so the backing music is n't so cold and efficient . you should probably just cherry-pick these from itunes . but even many of the good performances are sabotaged by that awful by-the-numbers studio sound .
