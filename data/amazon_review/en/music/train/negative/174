even for alw , this is pretty bad i 'm going to start this off by saying that i am not the biggest andrew lloyd webber fan . some of his works are amazing , like joseph and various songs from each of his musicals , yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows . unfortunately , the woman in white , his first try at gothic opera , is even worse . webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality , thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations , but they only show how little he truly knows about music . half of the show 's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection ( almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of sondheim ) . the tunes are bland , the book is boring and confusing , and many of the performances are sub-par . for instance , the actrees portraying the woman in white simply shrieks throughout the entire cd . even when she sings , her screaming din hurts one 's ears . it seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise . the other actors are generally adequite , yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull . admittedly , there are some highlights to this cd , such as crawford 's amazing portrayal of count fosco ( especially the live version of you can get away with anything ... it is hilarious ! ) , but overall , the cd is hard to take in . some songs are quite beautiful , yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking , dull dialogue , and loud music . i think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version cd of a musical , only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience
