i hear their next release will include a fold out shopping bag . i , like many others , wanted to like this cd , but was really disappointed . a lot of work obviously went into the creation of this . they have an interesting sound at first that quickly gets predictable . i thought the first song was decent enough , but after that the cd spirals downward fast . the main problem , as many reviewers have noted , is the singers voice , which is often hard to hear . but if i had a voice like his , i 'd probably want it towards the back of the sound mix . the most original thing about this cd was the liner notes/lyrics , which are presented in the form of a funeral program . get it ? cool , huh ?
