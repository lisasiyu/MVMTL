no , no , no , no , no i hate this band.they were the least respected group in the 70's.the only group which mattered in the 1970 's was pink floyd.i just cant understand that why in 2006 would people want to listen to these talentess di**heads when there is so much better music available than this.get pearl jam 's self titled album instead.buy this stupid album if you are still living in 1970's.zero star
