a bit of a disappointment hold the faith : with his debut album release , virtuous woman , warrior king cemented a reputation as one of jamaica 's hottest conscious singers in recent years . singles like never go where pagans go and virtuous woman bust up the jamaican charts , and established young warrior king as a major talent with strong vocal range , delivering cultural as well as lovers ' lyrics for some of the island 's biggest producers . in light of such a powerful debut , hold the faith turns out to be a bit of a disappointment . the album opens with an interesting introductory segment , and then the title track , which is decent but nothing to run out into the streets and shout about . from thereon out , hold the faith rides a few crests - like the herbally inspired meditation on the pass the kutchie ( full up ) rhythm , or the catchy sing-along , education - but mostly hovers right around average , or at worst , sinks to sadly uninspired . listening to forgettable roots-by-numbers efforts like freedom and judgment day , there 's little evidence that this is the work of the same singer whose compelling chanting style carried a modern classic like power to chant to the top every reggae playlist . even worse , there are a couple of performances - particularly the dreadful everyday - that sound like phone-ins ; a real let-down , and not at all what you 'd expect from an artist of warrior king 's caliber . overall , i really believe that hold the faith is just a misstep , and that if we can indeed hold the faith , warrior king will be back to reward us with his very best before too long . until then , this will just have to do
