great music , horrible mastering one of the best pieces of rock ever recorded , one of the worst reissue i ever heard . do not buy this japanese import ! if you know what this album is suppose to sound like then you will want to cry when you hear sony 's butchering of this reissue . i am not being over critical here , this mix will make you cringe , or maybe we are just getting spoiled by rhino 's superb job ? it 's a cryin sham
