there is much , much , much better stuff to listen to . having been born in '86 , i unfortunately did not yet exist to experience the late '70 's punk movement or was too young to be part of the '80 's hardcore years . instead , i got to grow up with the mtv generation ... . how so very lucky i am . yet , i figured out the difference between real music and the junk mainstream media keeps referring to as `` punk '' . so , if i could figure it out , any other idiot from this forsaken generation should n't have any problems . good charlotte is okay if you 're 8 years old , but if you 're 13 and you 're still listening them you need to just grow up and listen to much better stuff . if you 're my age and you listen to good charlotte then you are beyond any help . instead of good charlotte , buy or steal the real thing : subhumans : time flies + rats . it was the first one i picked up and it led to an entire collection of real , gritty , raw punk music . to all the good charlotte fans , take the advice i just gave you . go from whining about how much your life sucks to actually doing something about it .
