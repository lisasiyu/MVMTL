anderson l this outing from steve wilson and aviv geffen was a big disappointment to me . for one , there are no standout songs on this cd . its all one big mish mosh . i figured that this would be at least as strong as the first blackfield cd . the songwriting seems weak and slapped together . they are going to have do something spectacular if i buy another cd of theirs . also the song `` where is my love '' should n't have been redone . it should have been left off this cd
