lacking outstanding track selection as always , the dutchman comes through with quality mixxing talent . unfortunately for me , i felt there was a lack for outstanding musical selection . i didnt feel like there were any outstanding tracks ... nothing with a unique and outstanding rhythm . i like progressive mixes , but i have to say this mix did n't progress to anything outstanding .
