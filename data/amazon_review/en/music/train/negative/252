zzzzzzzzzzzzzz for a group that exudes such passion in their music ( live from buffalo anybody ? ) this song is like a funeral dirge . i can only hope that they have n't released the full album because they are trying to rekindle the passion that has made them the fan-favorite that they are . take your time guys - let 's get your best work . t
