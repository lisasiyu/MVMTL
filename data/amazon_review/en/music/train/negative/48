cruel brittania britain , circa 1997 . tony blair is elected p.m. princess di perishes . and the spice girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public . this effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing . to be fair , the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is . rather , they are appealing and prove to be the film 's lone redeeming factor . the fault lies in the script that tries to do for the spice girls what `` a hard days ' night '' did for the beatles . whereas the fab four 's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it 's trying to say about the spice craze . i was reminded more of the monkees ' `` head '' than i was of `` a hard days ' night '' . lots of celeb cameos ( roger moore , elton john , et al ) that amount to naught . oh , well . on to `` from justin to kelly ''
