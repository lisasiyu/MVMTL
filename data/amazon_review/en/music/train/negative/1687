buy the cd not the single i have listened to this cd many times and every time i listen to the single it just makes me mad . the album version is a lot better and i wonder why moby would want join forces with gwen . the cd 's version is unbelievable and i was happy to hear it become a single . i did not like moby teaming with gwen . buy the cd and see how much better moby as an artist . the music is much better and worth the money
