a flavor of the month past its due date painful to hear and painful to watch . a yester-year pop singer who does n't have the courage to quit . there is nothing left to do so she keeps throwing out pointless album after pointless album to stay in the spotlight ; if that is n't the highest form of egoism i do n't know what is . she 's got fame she 's got fortune she had her hits why not just go now please ? what she use to do for shock value in the early days now seems so trite and pathetic . the woman is nothing more then a spectacle with very little substance . she uses anything from sex to religion to self promote . yes i was a fan in the days of like a prayer and vogue but i have moved on , why madonna does n't come to the same conclusion i will never understand . this cd is good for the flavor of the month but its shelf life is way past due . i challenge madonna to put on a concert without all the antics and overt sexual malarkey that dominates her shows ; she would be booed right off the stage if that were to happen . and please enough with the crucifixion stunts all ready .
