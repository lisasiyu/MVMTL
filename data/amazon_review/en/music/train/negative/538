disappointing effort from an otherwise solid act i wanted to like brotherhood , for the simple reason that nearly every new order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it , usually with a faint whiff of snobbery ( or at least apathy ) . turns out they were right : brotherhood is half an album . most of its nine songs feel unfinished , as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash low-life and did n't care about the end result . brotherhood is a rush job , plain and simple , but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort . `` as it is when it was '' overcomes the album 's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic , and the melody is quite lovely . `` all day long '' , the emotional centerpiece of the album by default , is an intelligent ( if half-hearted ) protest against child abuse . while `` angel dust '' lacks a decent hook , its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest . and the toss-off `` every little counts '' has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in new order 's work . the most popular song on brotherhood is , of course , `` bizarre love triangle '' . so good it seems to belong to a different album entirely , `` bizarre love triangle '' is truly new order 's masterpiece . the solid beat , slick sequencer work , and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best : catchy , danceable , and downright euphoric . ( imagine how well it would have fit on low-life . ) sadly , the rest of brotherhood is unremarkable . the album 's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes , which has become new order 's signature sound , but the songwriting does n't measure up . buy the album if you 're a trainspotter , but casual new order fans would be better off picking up low-life or 1983 's power , corruption and lies . this one is just a footnote .
