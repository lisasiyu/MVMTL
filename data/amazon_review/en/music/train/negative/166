one thing is predictable : this is lame ! jamie foxx might be best known as a mediocre actor ( with one good performance as `` ray. '' ) . but now he can best known now as a mediocre singer/writer . while he has a good voice , he 's either corny or has no hooks . basically , there is no substance but he figures he can capitalize after the movie `` ray . '' and to anyone who says that he can write good songs , let 's look at a song and see his wonderful poetic lyrics : yo you sleep naw i just um , i think i want some more yea i know we just got through but its just so good , i just caint help it tho ' its something about your body naw it aint all i think about well to be honest , oh im startin ' to believe , something 's wrong wit me , cause everyday , every night , every hour , every minute i 'm thinkin ' `bout it i can be at my job , in my car , up in church and when i try to pray it off , it wo n't work it seems that i caint get enough of [ chorus : ] ( sex ) all the time ( sex ) on my mind ( sex ) everywhere i go ( sex ) i 'm tryna let you know ( sex ) it 's stronger than any drug even love s-e-x ohhheee ( sex ) can make you crazy ( sex ) can make a baby ( sex ) all night long ( sex ) it 's the perfect song ( sex ) stronger than any drug even love s-e-x oh its getting to the point where i ( where i ) i watch it on tv when i buy dvds thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases ( 39.99 for the new releases ) i aint proud of it , cause it 's getting in the way of love for me and i caint help it , caint shake it ( you know what ) sometimes i hear it calling me [ chorus : ] ( sex ) all the time ( sex ) on my mind ( sex ) everywhere i go ( sex ) i 'm tryna let you know ( sex ) it 's stronger than any drug even love s-e-x ohhheee ( sex ) can make you crazy ( sex ) can make a baby ( sex ) all night long ( sex ) it 's the perfect song ( sex ) stronger than any drug even love s-e-x oh some call it bad , some call it good some do it bourgeois , some do it hood i do it hood ( can i say that one more time ) girl i do it hood ohh some like it slow , some like it fast it do n't matter the tempo long as it lasts i make it last ( can i say that one more time ) girl i make it last ohh -wow , that 's a big pile of garbage ! lyrics like that should easily win him a grammy . keep it up , jamie !
