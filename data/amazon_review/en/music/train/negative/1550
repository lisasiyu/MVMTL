derivative and uncompelling america was formed by dan peek , dewey bunnel and gerry beckley , three us military brats living in london . america generally sounds like either a third rate crosby , stills , nash and young or barclay james harvest ( who were all ready a second rate moody blues ) without any new ideas of their own . this 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums
