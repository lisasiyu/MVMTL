grungy rechanneled sound nice package ... .attractive and it has almost all of the tracks by this minor group that you would want , but they took the gnp crescendo album master tapes ... complete with tons of horrible-sounding rechanneled tracks and grungy , distorted stereo . the sound is no better than the old gnp cds that have been around for years ... .which were 10th generation copies of the masters for the vinyl lps . finally , the track are in no particular order and there 's no information about each track fits into the seeds body of music . it 's apparent that the guy who prepared this collection ( pat gilbert ) knows nothing about the era and is defintively not the guy to have done this reissue
