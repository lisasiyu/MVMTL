bush 's weakest effort . kate bush 's second album , `` lionheart '' , may be the weakest in her catalog . its clear bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing `` the kick inside part two '' , and instead reaches in a number of different directions , some successful , some less so . musically , the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record ( `` in search of peter pan '' , `` in the warm room '' ) , a more pop structure ( `` wow '' ) , rhythmic shifts ( `` do n't put your foot on the heartbrake '' ) an almost shuffle ( `` fullhouse '' ) and a gret rock song ( `` hammer horror '' ) . lyrically , bush has added a level of sensuality to her work ( `` symphony in blue '' ) and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects ( `` kashka from baghdad '' ) . the problem is that it does n't hang together well to my mind -- admittedly , my rating for the album is in many ways relative to bush 's other work , no album with the absolutelyu amazing `` kashka from baghdad '' can be all that bad , and certainly `` symphony in blue '' is strong enough to stop you in your tracks , but the album just does n't work for me . for early bush , try her debut ( `` the kick inside '' ) or the stunning `` never for ever ''
