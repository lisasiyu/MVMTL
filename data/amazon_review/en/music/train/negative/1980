terribly dissapointing now before you shrug me off as a hater ... i just want to make it clear that i love rob zombie ... i am more of a white zombie fan because they just have so much more going on in the music and lyrics than rob has even come close to with his solo endevors . white zombie made some of the most amazing music of the 90s . i like hellbilly deluxe , it 's a very good album , not near as tantalizing as anything white zombie did , but still very good . this album however is a complete departure from everything before it . the only good tracks are sinners inc & transylvanian transmissions , what some would call `` fillers '' a labeling i despise , these 2 tracks are amazing , and the ozzie track is alright , but everything else is just mindless ramblings and power cords rolled into a brainless shpeil of banter about nothing . i so do not dig this whole poppy thing hes doin in the slightest . hellbilly deluxe is a far supirior album , while this album is not even worthy of being compared to anything white zobmie did . alas rob ... what happened ? why god ? why ? but dont take my word for it ... listen to those cuts from the tracks amazon posts . they all suck . nuff said ... rob ... your next album better kick ass , thats all i got ta say
