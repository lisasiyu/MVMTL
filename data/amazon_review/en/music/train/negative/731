attempt to meaning i was just going to write another on of my moronic reviews , but i could n't stand anything about the album . i hate good charlotte , they sound exactly like every other prep-rock band ( fall out boy , my chemical romance , simple plan ect . ) i could tell simply by comparing the name of the album to the `` song '' names that this had nothing to do with life or death , and considering their preppy reputation that there would be no hidden meanings withing the songs . after i listened to a couple of these so called `` songs '' i turned it off , and quickly threw it out of the window . my point being , with bands such as this , do n't expect anything hidden within the title , or the music . it will just be a boring listen the entire way through . if you were looking for an album that does have meaning , and is fun to listen too . i suggest eating your own exrement
