ronald & ernie you do n't need r. kelly ! get rid of him ! i 've been a huge fan of the isleys for over 30 years , and stuck by them through the early motown soul and their golden groove-funk period of the 1970s , through to the later stuff right up to the excellent mission to please album . but that 's when they should have dumped r. kelly , because it 's the last album that had any really decent hook to it . and when you have a blistering guitarist like ernie isley , why bury him so far in the mix that his licks sound like they 're being played through cotton wool ? r. kelly 's plodding grooves just grind from one indistinguishable track to another , which is pretty much the case on the even more disappointing follow-up to this , body kiss . the only track that kicks any ass here is the opener , move your body , which fools you into thinking this might be a return to former glories for our heroes . sadly , the leaden funk of r. kelly then comes crashing in like a tidal wave of sludge and we get a whole turgid mess of leaden walking-pace 'grooves ' that might sound all right in the background when you 're getting it on with the partner of your dreams , but as listening music just gets you all exasperated and reaching for the 3+3 album again . come on , isleys , dump the kelly glop and get back to what you can do best
