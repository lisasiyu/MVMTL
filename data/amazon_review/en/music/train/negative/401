the song samples proved me right . i 've listened to the samples of this cd , and i was proved right . this cd , along with this groups other cds were emotionless , has no depth , originality , or meaning . the songs like `` without you '' are just sickening to listen to . not only do their voices sound sickening to the point where i want to wretch , but the songs on this cd are just depressing to the point where you want to kill yourself . the originals were depressing , and so are the new versions of these songs . this is really getting old . buy something from joseph vargo instead . maybe there is something with originality in it . i 'm sorry , but the truth hurts , and we need to face it . do n't buy this cd , or all of il divo 's cds unless you want someone to laugh at you
