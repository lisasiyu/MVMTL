the highest of the highest shlomo has become the heart and soul of jewish music , even in the synagogue . his melodies are now 'davvaned ' in places which once cursed him . he was without question a musical genius whose depth of soul is reflected in every note and word he sings . in this early music one can already hear that longing , that love which so touches the listener . his voice is not great , but the feeling it conveys goes well beyond what is ordinarily given in most singing . he has the holy in him , the nearness to and longing for g-d. and he conveys that to us , so sweetly , so beautifully . oy heilegen shlomo what would we do without your music ?
