nothing is worse than a generic power ballad ... i really gave this album a chance . there were even a couple of moments where i thought that a song had a particularly good ( in a cheesy way ) 80 's arena rock riff . but without fail , even the songs that start out `` good '' , turn into generic forgettable 80 's rock -- you know the type that littered the early 80 's music scene and all sounded as if it was written by some studio executive and a computer . i guess there is no accounting for taste , and everyone can have their opinions . unless you are really into early 80 's power ballads , however , do n't even think about getting this album
