arg all i have to say is this cd is not comprised of ballads . it really frustrates me how stupid these ad guys are . ballad -- a ballad is a story , usually a narrative or poem , in a song . any story form may be told as a ballad , such as historical accounts or fairy tales in verse form . it usually has foreshortened , alternating four- and three-stress lines ( 'ballad meter ' ) and simple repeating rhymes , often with a refrain . if it is based on political or religious themes , a ballad may be a hymn . it should not be confused with the ballade , a 14th and 15th century french verse form . some good examples of ballads : the devil went down to georgia , the ballad of jesse james , johnny has gone for a soldier , ode to billie joe while there are a couple of songs on this album that are actual ballads , the large majority are not . the same goes with that monster ballads cd with all the bad eighties hair metal/pop rock
