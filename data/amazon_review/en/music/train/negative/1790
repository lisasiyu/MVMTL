just for laughs , a little dissention ... i bought this lp when it first came out . i 'd drowned my happy soul in `` out of the cool '' and got lost for months in the moods of `` individualism '' . add to that his `` guitar forms '' lp with kenny burrell and the `` sketches '' album , i was ready for more of the pure evanescence , and not ready for gil evans to do what most self-respecting composers do -- shift gears . no , change cars . in mid-drive . this album was a huge change to me , and i tried to follow him but could n't . kind of like trying to follow stravinsky from his neo-classical phase to his atonal phase . maybe he ( gil evans ) made it , maybe the other reviewers are right , and it 's all great stuff , but it lost me . no magic , no startles , no surprises that i could suck into my soul and thrive on . so , be warned , be cautious . it 's a change , and it signals a change that he continued on for the rest of his career , and if you loved `` individualism '' , you might not make the jump . then again , maybe you will . i just have to go on record to say all this , as one evans fan who is disappointed
