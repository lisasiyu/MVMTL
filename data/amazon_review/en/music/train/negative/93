bad halloween effects i purchased this cd and i was ripped off . the sounds on the cd are pathetic . they are of poor quality , with one person standing in a sound booth . i could have made a better recording with my tape recorder and mic myself . i was looking for a cd to compile a string of sounds for my haunted house . now i have to find another means of getting these sounds . do n't buy this cd . you will not get your moneys worth
