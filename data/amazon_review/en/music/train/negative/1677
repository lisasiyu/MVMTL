`` bill '' is the man i knew-smokey robinson , r & b at it 's best the old timers like me back in the inner cities where smokey and the miracles orginally put their stake down in motown and r & b royalty , used to call him bill smokey robinson . whenever i meet someone who recalls the days back in the early to mid sixties when the black transistor made in japan radios were blaring down the new york city school hallways playing the tracks of my tears , shop around , ooo baby baby ( which brings back memories of my first interacial slow dance in the junior high school gym ) and the tears of a clown , all selections being on the ultimate collection~smokey robinson and the miracles , i know that my buddy remembers smokey 's spindly aura on the stage and his silky smoooth and relaxed delivery . i apologize to my readers for run on sentences but smokey requires such detailed explanation as a legendary contributor to soul , r & b and the motown wall of sound ( they had one too ) that my effusive and continuing acclamation of this cherished and enormously loved performer is understated . i heard that smokey recently brought his performance to flint , michigan or maybe some other backyard town in auto country . i really wish that i could have been there to see smokey put out before a hometown crowd . that must have been nothing short of a miracle . i am going to hit the click button now myself , i need to hear again the sounds that captivated all of us when we walked down the hallways in junior high with the made in japans , fingerpopping all the way . please note , i meant to push 5 stars on this cd and can not figure out how to correct the above . i apoligize for any misunderstanding however everybody who has ever been touched by smokey 's music probably realized this faux pas . jay adler , massapequa , new yor
