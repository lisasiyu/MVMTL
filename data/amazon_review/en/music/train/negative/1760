make up your mind tina ! ! my gosh ! ! tina had made 2 cd 's of all the best is a waste of money on tina turner . do n't take us wrong we do fond of her but why would she made 2 times of all the best ? ! about the same as en vogue ! ! it 's not worth on buying this one because it only has 18 songs in this cd ! ! so think twice ! ! the best cd 's you could get is 2 sets of cd of all the best it has over 25 songs in it it would save you alot of money from buying these 2 cd 's for once tho ... just my opinion ! ! honestly for this cd we would give 1 star but the other one of all the best that has 2 sets of cd 's and has over 25 songs in it we would for sure give 5 stars for that one !
