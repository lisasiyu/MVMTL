this album was n't that good i did n't like this album that much . only songs i liked are the mc , step into a world , a friend , ca n't stop wo n't stop . just to prove a point song was horrible and i do n't know why he tried to do a rock song . putting puff daddy on the step into a world remix was a terrible decision by krs . the songs were too short on this album also .
