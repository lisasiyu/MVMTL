not a fan , but at least they changed the name and i can respect that if you knew me , you would probably know that i love punk music ... .old epitaph bands tickle my fancies greatly..they days when epitaph was the punk label..you know , the label with all the re-mastered classics , plus phenomenal newer acts anyways , until recently , this whole new emo/screamo thing was getting on my nerves ... mainly for the reason that it was being labeled as `` punk . '' yes , this compilation still contains bad religion and pennywise..which is great..i mean i would never buy this for just 2 decent songs and i still pretty much hate new emo , but i can respect epitaph records now that they ditched `` punk o rama '' since they contain very little punk . epitaph has a great extension in hellcat records to appease the punks/skins ... i would surely recommend that someone pick up the `` give em the boot '' compilations if they want punk rock . now , the only thing i really despise epitaph for these days is the fact that they have so many classics that are out of print and near impossible to find ! bottom line , if you want punk go to hellcat , if you want new emo and other oddity musicians come to this , the new phase of punk o rama . 2 stars because i dont really care for this , but it earns my respect
