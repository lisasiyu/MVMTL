sour cream 32 years ago i was so stoked that clapton was finally coming out with a new album , i walked five miles to deorsey 's records in lewiston , maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record . the still near virgin vinyl remains in my lp collection and has only been played once . once was enough . heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness , inspiration and technical ability . sad .
