disappointing i 'd like to start by saying how amazing new american gospel is . then by saying what a solid follow-up as the palaces burn is . lamb of god is truly one of the best american thrash/metalcore acts . however , if you enjoy either of their first releases , i would recommend skipping this one . it 's disappointing and generic . if you 're considering buying this and do n't own the previous albums , buy them first . lamb of god is an aggressive , technically skilled band , and i really expect their next release to be a comeback after this one
