this cd ... i bought this cd because `` superstreet '' rated it so well in their magazine . the beats are continous and boring . if he had any skillz he should have used them for more uptempo beats . but everyone who rated this seemed to like it so at least he has some fans outthere . my recommendation do n't buy it unless you like slow boring not even close to melodic beats how one could even dance to this is an enigma to me . in other words i 'll never buy another cd with chris fortier 's name on it ever again
