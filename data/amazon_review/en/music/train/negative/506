great message ... poor delivery do n't get me wrong . i 'm a raging hippie , who 's completely anti-war . and the lyrics on this album are great , and i love the cover of `` imagine '' by john lennon . but it seems that the actual desire to make good *music* fell to the back burner on this one . it 's not that the songs are bad per se , but they 're all fillers . it 's an entire album of fillers , with no really great songs to bring them up . overall , a disappointment , which is unfortunate , since the wonderful message is lost by the lack of lustre in the music . if you 're new to a perfect circle , pick one of the other albums . if you 're a veteran , sure , pick it up . but i 'd suggest listening to it on random with your other a perfect circle and tool cd 's
