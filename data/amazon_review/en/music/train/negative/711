you 're buying the wrong cd ! yes , this is the great pbbb 's 3rd album , but it 's not the cd you should be buying . this domestic cd was released in 1989 and has never been remastered . the import 2cd version of this title ( backed with the pbbb 's 4th `` in my own dream '' ) is the one to get . it was remastered in 2004 . ditto for `` the paul butterfield blues band '' & `` east west '' ; the 2004 import 2cd is also remastered ( and sounds incredible ) and the domestic cd 's are not . why wea and elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery . do n't waste your money on these inferior versions : get the imports
