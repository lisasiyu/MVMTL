average i was hyped about them coming back after they rocked on dj quik 's rhythmalism.that album was slammin'but this disc is about 5 years past the pull date on style.up 'n da club is tight.straight up dj quik is a musical genius.but he ca n't pull this disc off properly.amg is banging on the track but overall it 's missing something
