surprised and disappointed i was not pleased with the quality of this recording . the mcgarrigles are just wonderful , but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster . the first and last cuts seem ok , but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy ! the piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible . i also did n't appreciate the sisters ' reworking of several songs i already love from `` the bells of dublin '' ( some of the best christmas music ever recorded ) . the sparkle i longed for just is n't there in this one
