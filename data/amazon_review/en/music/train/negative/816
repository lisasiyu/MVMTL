i wanted the music on cd -- not the movie on cd i really enjoy the great synthesizer sound ( usually this phrase would be an oxymoron ) of this film . john carpenter is definitely a multi-talented artist ( writer , director , composer ) . so , i am not in any way criticizing the music itself . my gripe is against this particular cd release . i was expecting to receive a cd with only the music . unfortunately , very few of these tracks are music only . most of them are music accompanied by dialogue from the movie . if this only happened once or twice , i would n't mind so much . but it 's nearly every single track . would you buy the star wars soundtrack if it had a whole bunch of dialogue on the tracks ? how about the godfather , lord of the rings , gladiator , or any other great motion picture soundtrack ? if people want the dialogue , then they will surely buy the dvd . but most people buy a soundtrack for the sole purpose of having the music only
