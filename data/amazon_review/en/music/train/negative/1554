oh well i never write reviews for the cds i buy , but felt the need for this one . nfg seemed to be maturing with catalyst , but sadly went back to writing the same thing they always wrote . i tried listening to the cd a lot to get hooked , but it 's weaker than their self-titled . they grew for the next two albums into something bigger and better , and then lost it all . this album is super poppy , which is ok , but the lyrics are some of their worst . i know some might disagree , and that 's fine . i just wanted to warn people , if you liked the direction they were going in catalyst , then you 'll probably see this one as a step backwards . sorry nfg ! i still love you ! in a manly hitting each other sort of way
