this compilation is so wrong i loved the 90 's . some great things happened to me in the 90 's and i have tons of great memories , none of which are associated with anything about this compilation . to be fair , i 'm ok with 3 , maybe 4 of the songs . tubthumping and shine i can deal with . the former was kind of good but severely overplayed for and by the worst kind of people . the latter is not a good song but somehow it has grown on me , plus i think it 's funny that the guitar part is stolen directly from the kinks ' & quot ; lola & quot ; . i 've always thought i 'm too sexy was funny , bad but funny . and the en vogue song is actually kind of good , but do n't tell anyone i said that . the rest of the album ? crap of the crappiest crap caliber . the macarena ? mambo no . 5 ? whoomp there it is ? those songs should never have even seen the light of day . and o.p.p . was possibly the worst thing about the 90 's . plus does anybody really need to own the theme from friends ? why why why ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! the only attrocity this cd is missing is that awful choo choo train song . please make this one go away quickly
