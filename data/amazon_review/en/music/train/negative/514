very disappointed ... thoughts from a cohen `` first timer '' i had never heard leonard cohen 's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters . given his status/reputation i thought i should get this cd and learn what all the fuss was about . having had no preconceptions , i have to say i was quite disappointed . i think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable . perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best . specific example that speaks volumes : listen to cohen 's singing of his `` hallelujah '' and then listen to jeff buckley 's cover of that song on `` grace '' which was recorded in 1994 . sorry , leonard , you can not hold even a birthday-sized candle to jeff buckley 's rendition of your own song . it is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of cohen 's legacy . `` tant pis , vers le bonheur .
