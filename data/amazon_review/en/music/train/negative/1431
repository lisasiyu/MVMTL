everything that 's wrong with rock music i ca n't even begin to describe how much this band sucks . suffice it to say that you will probably enjoy this cd if you are a fan of talentless nu-metal bands like staind and taproot . i bought this because i was trying to find a new band in the same vein as 90s crunch masters like helmet and quicksand , but i was severely disappointed . this is a cd for people who like their music simplistic , plodding , one-dimensional , and repetitive . wonder what 's next ? -- how about another song just as bad as the one that preceded it ! after the third song of lifeless droning , it just becomes annoying as the torment continues unabated . i 've listened to this cd several times in an attempt to understand what so many others like about it , but i 've concluded that i wo n't be able to fully appreciate this band until i can learn to fall asleep and puke at the same time
