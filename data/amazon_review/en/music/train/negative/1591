a pretty weak album - 2.5 stars slayer released diablos in musica in 1998 . this is a decent thrash album , but definitely not up to slayer 's standards . yeah , some people think slayer sucks and they say they are over-rated . these people are entitled to their opinion . that being said , diablos really is slayers weakest album . maybe tom araya was able to sing in 1988 , but his singing 10 years later just ruins the music . his normal vocals are ok , but when he sings or tries a spoken word section , it really shows that he should stick with what he knows ( if only james hetfield took my advise ; his voice makes me want to puke now ) . songs like death 's head , stain of mind , love to hate are probably the worst slayer songs they wrote up to this point . this is the slayer album i listen to the least . there are song good songs : bitter peace , overt enemy , scrum and screaming from the sky . too bad the rest of the album is rather boring .
