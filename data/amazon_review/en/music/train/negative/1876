two great rarities and lot of crappy remixes this review has to start with a couple of admissions . first , i happen to think cyndi lauper ( especially in her later albums ) is an underrated songwriter and performer . most people think of her as a pop-culture icon of the 80 's and unfortunately dismiss what she 's done since then . some of her later ballads are sung with great emotion and are among the best-written songs i 've ever heard . on the other hand , i really hate remixes , especially when they 're done solely to try to make `` danceable '' a song that was never intended to be dance music . so i approached this album with a mix of excitement and fear ... excitement that the `` rarities '' would be more of cyndi 's great songwriting and fear that the remixes would suck , as remixes tend to do . the two rarities on the album are the songs `` the world is stone '' and `` you have to learn to live alone '' . there are also extended versions of `` mother '' and `` what 's going on '' . `` the world is stone '' talks about how people are turning to stone , `` cold to the touch and hard on the soul '' . the instrumentals are acceptable but nothing special . cyndi 's vocals convey the emotional message she 's sending exceptionally well , and it 's a well-written message about there being `` no warmth anymore '' and `` no love anymore '' . while it may be a `` rarity '' it is definitely one of her better and more powerful songs . `` you have to learn to live alone '' has a kind of blues or jazz sound to it . you could imagine it being sung in a smoky nightclub in casablanca . cyndi pulls off the kind of vocals you expect with the music , delivering a powerful and emotional performance in the context of what 's a fairly subdued , soft song . the instrumentals on this song are much better than those for `` the world is stone '' . the rest of the album consists of remixes , and as i said above , i generally hate remixes . these are really no exception . if i had to describe the remixes on this album in a single sentence , that sentence would be : `` how to turn some decent cyndi lauper music into something unrecognizable and crappy . '' if you 're into the techno-sounding disco stuff , you might enjoy these , i do n't know . personally , they ruin some decent songs to me . the only good thing i can find to say about them is that at least they did n't mess with some of her better songs and stuck with the more mainstream stuff like `` hey now ( girls just wan na have fun ) '' ... if the entire album was like `` the world is stone '' and `` you have to learn to live alone '' i would probably give it something in the 8-10 ( out of 10 ) range . those two songs are quite good and easily among her best work . but the 6 remixes on the album pretty much ruin it for me , and i ca n't in good conscience give the entire album anything better than about a 4 . if it was an album of just the remixes , it would get maybe a 2 , and would only rank that high because cyndi 's voice appears in them
