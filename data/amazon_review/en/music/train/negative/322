ouch ! ! hearing this hurt my feelings i 'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves . their first two albums really rocked the joint . but i 'm sorry to report that this album really does n't add up . it just does n't make much sense to me at all . there is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here ! instead they 've gone for a really lazy , laid back style which does n't hold yer interest . for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff , which sounds promising enough , but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and does n't re-appear at all . they then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends ! ! the whole album goes like that . songs barely get going and then promptly end . the second guitar play has disappeared to ! which means you do n't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( i reckon he was the talented one ) . they 've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who , i kid u not , puts samples of fireworks in one song ! ! ( i 've said enough ) c'mon people ! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls . i heard that andrea 's vocals are shot n ' the doc said she had to cool it down , so i can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. but they are heading in the direction of dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that . i 've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. what d'you guys think about it ? i hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop . it 's like henry rollins said `` if you aint gon na put 110 % in do n't even bother ''
