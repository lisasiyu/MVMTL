come on this live album is well recorded , and the band is the best its ever been . why only 2 stars ? the tracklist ! apart from can i play with madnes ( yay ! ) and lord of the flies ( yawn ) , its exactly the same as rock in rio , released a couple of years ago , with dance of death instead of brave new world songs . why not play somewhere in time , or wasted years ? or futureal ( ok blaze song but still ) ? or powerslave ? all would have fitted into the theme of the concert well . i do n't need to see another version of hallowed be thy name . or wrathchild . or fear of the dark . or run to the hills . good performance ( as expected ) , but very disappointing tracklist
