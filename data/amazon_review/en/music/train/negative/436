faith hill - selling out to sell records ... . faith hill has been known ( both celebrated and criticized ) for testing the waters . she has never `` played it safe '' ... until now . first of all , this disc seems like a poor defense and/or apology for `` cry '' . `` cry '' was a great album . it may not have been commercially successful , but it was a very personal album . amy grant also had this issue . `` lead me on '' , though not her most commercially successful , was her most intimate and personal album . kudos for baring your soul . this is the function of an artist . as for `` fireflies '' , most of the music and song selection seems geared at making sure faith hill gets played on country radio . still wounded from being eaten alive by critics who disliked `` cry '' , faith has decided to duck back into the 'safety zone ' and win back her conservative country audience . the only problem i have with that is that faith hill shines best when she pushes the envelope ; when she goes out on a limb and tries something distinctive that stands out . nothing on this cd stand out . if the songwriting is at all great , ( as with the title track , stealing kisses , and if you ask ) the vocals fall short of emotional depth . i understand that faith is a lot older now , and she has to compete with vocal powerhouses like carrie underwood , and songwriting geniuses like miranda lambert , but it seems gone are the days of `` this kiss '' and `` breathe '' . however ... faith hill is facing a double dose of dilemnas : `` fireflies '' is not selling as well as `` breathe '' and `` faith '' did , and more importantly , her country audience still is n't quite impressed with the `` i-dyed-my-hair-and-hillbilly'd-up-for-you '' image that faith has unveiled
