hubert sumlin rehash i do n't know what i was expecting from hubert sumlin . surely not a rehash of some old muddy waters ' and willie dixon chestnuts that were done correctly the first time with muddy 's voice and band . this album was a big dud . sumlin takes the songs and tries to sing them and tries to make his band sound as if they were recording in the same style and sound as chess studio in the 1940 's and 50 's . unfortunatley muddy had a better voice and so does willie dixon for that matter . all the session men sound like add-ons to the old band , not muscicians who can bring their own style and verve to this thing . pretty weak effort by all , unless sumlin is himself to blame , as a control freak who did not have the vision to see what he was creating , something that had already been created 50 years before . one redeeming quality of this cd is the final cut , an acoustic number that sounds as if some originality had been finally injected into the session . sumlin is in need of an editor , or at least a confidant , who could have helped him with a better song selection or at least a better and more original way of handling these tunes .
