eh i bought cd because at the time , i was a huge utada hikaru fan . her voice is shrill most of the time , but one can overlook that . however , after a time , her songs became boring . her lyrics are boring too , and the average jpop artist can write them . ayumi hamasaki is much , much , much , much better than utada . if you want the real jpop queen , go for ayu . if you want a shrill-voiced artist that 's bland and boring , go for utada
