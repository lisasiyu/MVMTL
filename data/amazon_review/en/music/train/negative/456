what 's not to love about ludacris ? how can you not relate to ludacris 's music ? it deals with every day life like chilin in da hood and slapin da bitchis an hos . it 's so deep . i can identify with his music so much it 's scary . i sure hope one day i can become a musical genious like him . forget about no-name bands like pink floyd , yes , and radiohead , they 're never played on mtv so saying that they 're talented is like saying ashlee simpson did n't create rock n ' roll ! ludacris-the most talented musician on the planet-is going to change the world ! ! ! if you took any of that seriously , this album is for you
