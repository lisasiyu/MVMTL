very disappointing . george benson is one the greatest guitarist of all time . i bought this cd with the hope of hearing george benson play the guitar with the skill and passion that most professional performers could only dream about . george benson did come through on two of the three purely instrumental tracks , `` softly , as in a mountain sunrise '' and `` arizona sunrise . '' these are the only two tracks produce by paul brown . the other instrumental , `` take you out '' is a tribute to luther vandross and is on the `` forever , for always , for luther '' cd . george benson does showcase some of his talent , but he kept the song true to luthers ' rendition `` take you out . '' the bottom line is : if you think george benson is a great vocalist , you will love this cd , and in my opinion , he is just tolerable . three instrumental tracks , seven vocal tracks , this cd is not `` irreplaceable . ''
