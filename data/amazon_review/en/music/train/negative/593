the dvd is bad , as in not worth watching ! ! ! ! ! i read all the reviews about this boxed set and nobody ever said that the dvd is so dark that most of the time you see a outline of bruce only . i do n't care if this is a piece of history , if you ca n't see the main performer then why waste the space ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the only person that you can see good is the sax player because he 's wearing a white suit and once in a while they put a white spot on him . save your money and buy the other dvd 's ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
