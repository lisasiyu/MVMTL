the jewel case has more value than the disc this is the worst lp in recording history . the covers are embarassingly bad , and especially their cover of lou reed 's `` sweet jane '' which is down right hideous and i 'd be suprised if lou reed would n't beat the living daylights out of all three of these losers if he ever saw them . if you think grand funk railroad covering the stones ' `` gimmie shelter '' was ridiculous , that 's nothing ; this is far , far worse . as for their big hit single , `` smoking in the boys ' room '' here 's a newsflash : it 's a novelty song , nothing more . the rest of the songs are `` me wan na hump you '' caveman songs ineptly play that make bad company sound sophisticated . i 'm sorry cub koda died young , but there is a silver lining in that cloud : he 's not recording anymore . rated 1 star because zero was n't available . avoid at all costs . unless you want a ten dollar mini frisbee that comes with a jewel case
