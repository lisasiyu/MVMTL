sorry , this is weak . i first heard nadia ali on a few tracks from global underground 29 - sharam/dubai ( which i seriously recommend ) which immediately made her my new favorite singer - so i bought this with great expectations , only to be really dissapointed . i ca n't imagine why she 's working with this guy - sorry , he 's a hack - these tracks sound like leftovers from kylie minogue 's trash , and yes , i could do better . avoid this at all costs & hope nadia finds somebody with talent to work with ... yawn
