oh em gee , what happened gwen ? a giant leap back from love.angel.music.baby . what was she thinking with this album ? this music does not compare at all to l.a.m.b . and her no doubt days . 'the sweet escape ' ( song ) is very successful on the charts , ... and i honestly do n't understand why . it 's so generic and 'woo hoo ' part is so annoying . the album is a one star but i 'll give her two because i still love gwen
