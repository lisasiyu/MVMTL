not true muddy this album was a disappointment . i was looking forward to muddy 's covers of & quot ; caldoinia & quot ; and & quot ; kansas city & quot ; but it wasnt what i thought itd be . dont get me wrong , muddy himself was fine , but he gets overshadowed by the musical collaborators . there is an overuse of harmonica and organ , and the annoying presence of accordian ! accordians and waters do not mix . this over-instrumentalization leaves the album sounding lame and folky and not bluesy . if you 're looking for muddy 's later work , try & quot ; blues sky & quot ; , with muddy working with johnny winter and his back to basics production
