soulless it 's incredible how a band with so much potential and a great debut could follow it up with such a dud . there is close to nothing capitvating or engaging on this record . the songs feel like poor b sides to the original album , and while nobody ever claimed them to be geniuses they were catchy , but even their keen pop sensibility is pretty much lacking here . slightly amusing for one spin , but in the long run utterly fogettable . not even worth your time to illegally download .
