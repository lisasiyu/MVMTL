very dissapointing i bought this record assuming the songs would be as poignant and memorable as those on ii . instead , i found the music to be busy and impersonal , and i thought the lyrics ( once again in comparison to those on ii ) sucked . its often said that up on the sun demonstrates the meat puppets coming into their own 'sound ' , and that its a vast improvement over ii . i fail to see how their work on ii was any less of a genuine expresssion of the bands vision than this frankly dull piece of work
