cash money still falling instead of balling yo this joint is wack . its a waste of time i do n't why i brought it . your best bet is to wait for lil weezee to drop his next album . he is cash money now . since juve has left maybe the rest of the hot boys should consider it too mickey and lac are just plain wack . mannie fresh has been surpassed by the likes of timberland , neptunes , track masters his beats just ca n't compete anymore . cash money should look into letting someone else do their tracks instead of mannie doing the whole album because he has lost his touch
