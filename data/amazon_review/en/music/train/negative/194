this is not good , do n't believe the hype ! now i have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic , and that it may be the most creative cd of all time , but when i take a listen , i just laugh . there are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that missy elliot has and are so much more creative . honestly , and the lyrics are awful , only a couple of the beats are okay , but after listening to missy elliot 's annoying voice , then you will be very frustrated like i was that i bought this
