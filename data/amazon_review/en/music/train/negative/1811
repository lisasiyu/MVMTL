what the hell is going on ! i 'm very confused . rap has turned to garbage in the blinking of an eye . i got all suave house c.d . 's and this ai n't the eightball and mjg i know . it 's only about 4 tight cuts on here . the rest of them are garbarge . the title of the album is one of the worst songs on here . i do n't know why they got swizz beatz to touch this album but he did n't do it any justice . his beats sound just like every thing else he does except worse . dj quik produced a couple of cuts on here to but there just as worse . the chores on just about all the songs are tired and plain . this album is to damn slow and soft ! it 's not a single song on this album to get you hype like coming out hard and on top of the world . even the lyrics are boring . i do n't know what happened between them and t-money but they need to hook back up with him quick , before its to late . i feel like i 'm in a contract . i have all there albums so i got ta keep buying them . if you decide to buy one of there albums for the first time , do n't buy this one ! garbage ! first jay-z 's last album , wu-tang 's last album , and now this . makes me want to break my foot off in somebody
