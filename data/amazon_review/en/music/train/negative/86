big disappointment i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album , and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse . ive seen sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound . this album is more pop . if it ai n't broke do n't fix it
