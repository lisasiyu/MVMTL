updated review now , i realize after taking a closer listen to this album that this album is not a gospel rap album . on ''know thy self '' , krs claims that there are many ways to god which is downright not true . krs claims that any ''god '' that 's worshipped will lead you to heaven . think about that , allah , buddah , jesus , aphrodite all have nothing to do with each other ! only jesus deserves to be worshipped ! jesus is the son of god , he did die , and he 's the only one that rose again so we could all have a chance to enter heaven regardless of our sin [ which every man and woman has ] . as for the cd , i wo n't lie , it sounds really good and even features a few gospel rappers [ t-bone , b.b . jay ] , and krs even makes significant quotes of actual bible verses , but when it comes down to it , krs still fails to acknowledge that jesus is the way , the truth , and the life . this cd gets 2 stars from me for the fact that at least krs is done dissing jesus [ something he did on every album after ''criminal minded '' and every album before ''the sneak attack '' ] and at least he still ai n't afraid to expose the problems of this world , but krs , if you 're reading this , i think you 're an extremely talented rapper and you truly need to accept jesus into your heart . hope the review helped . be blessed .
