the price is right . i am not sure why this compilation garnered such high scores so far . maybe because i am into a different brand of dnb , but the tracks on this cd are among the least musical pieces of noise i have heard , with rare exceptions . the beats are rather cliche dnb , which in itself is not too bad . the deep sub-basslines sound great production-wise , but the patterns are often nonsensical . generally , if you like very repetitive hard and fast dnb with powerful bass and sinister yet musically simplistic soundscapes , then by all means , get this cd . however , if you expect something fresh , clever , or something that has at least a little bit of musical value , look elsewhere . this is not roni size , aphrodite , or pendulum . this is dumbed-down dieselboy
