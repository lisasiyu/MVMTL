not elvis at his best . 1972 's elvis presley as recorded at madison square garden is not elvis at the top of his game . the numerous covers he performs sound awful . i can give the album a few points for having some of his best known songs on it , unlike some of his live albums . although the set is good , the performances leave something to be desired.forget about this one and buy the nbc tv special cd instead
