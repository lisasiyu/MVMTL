the warning : do n't buy this i randomly chose to buy and listen to this cd because they are playing at coachella . it is n't good . it reminds me of stereolab but without talent . each song is more insipid and boring than the last . the music is an unfortunate combination of beats from a dated drum machine , irritating electonic blips , guitar for beginners and vocal stylings that are wimpy and heartless . needless to say ... i do n't get it
