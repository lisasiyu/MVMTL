overrated perhaps it 's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations , but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak , the singing is weak , and the arrangements are dull something kicked all the life out of the music -- the songs are not all the same , but for some reason they all sound the same -- and embarrassingly , you can sing most of them after one listen , they are so simplistic and cliched
