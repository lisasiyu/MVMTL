linda -- what have you done ? this is definately not the linda ronstadt that i have loved listening to for the past 30 years ! i have been a ronstadt fan since the early 70s . loved her nelson riddle big band stuff , her tucson sessions album with emmylou harris , and just picked up her `` frenesi '' album and love it too . but this ... this is definately not the album to showcase her vocal talents . i could not even finish listening to it . the last cd i will buy without previewing the songs first . skip it .
