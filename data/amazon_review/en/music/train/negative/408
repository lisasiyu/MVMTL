victory ! ? more like a defeat ! ! ok , this was the last jacksons lp and i do n't understand why this was their best selling , compared to the gem destiny and super giant truimph . my father bought this in 1984 and did not even get his moneys worth . this is n't a reunion album at all . more like a high tech compilation disaster and jermaine is only included in 1 track and michael , only in 3 . although no video availbale , i love the mick jagger colab `` state of shock '' ( # 3 on billboard and # 4 on hot r & b/hip hop singles ) which was a celebrated pop/rock celebration and leading single off of lp . `` torture '' was torture and so was the video . although top 20 hit , it was so horrible that jermaine and michael did not join their brothers in the video ( although they provided lead vocals ) and the later was replaced by a wax dummy . `` body '' was good although marlon can not sing and the instrumental is a remisent to micahel 's `` wan na be startin ' somethin ' . later for the rest of the tracks of the album and being the worst is randy jackson 's falsetto disaster `` the hurt . '' this lp ( although i do not own the cd version of it ) was a huge disaster as well as their ill-fated final tour promoting it .
