now more than ever ... .this sucks ! ! ! ! i was super excited when i bought joann rosario 's first cd `` more , more , more . '' every song on there was gorgeous and inspired worship . i was just as thrilled when i found out she had a new release , `` now more than ever ... worship . '' i heard one of her singles , `` god '' and figured i had to buy the cd when it came out . but boy was i disappointed when i popped it in my cd player ! ! ! the only stand out tracks are : track 3 : thanks be unto god track 6 : i hear you say track 13 : god the bonus track : cuando reposo en ti all of the other tracks are barely mediocre . it was as if she rushed the making of her cd just to keep her name out in the spotlight . i am extremely upset that i wasted $ 20 on this piece of junk . i thought some worship music would be on here , since the title of the cd is `` worship , '' but do n't be mislead by this fanciful cover and her pretty face . she should 've waited until she had something solid to record instead of making this crappy attempt at music . joann has indeed hit the dreaded sophomoric slump . i highly doubt that i 'd buy anything else she sings . what was fred hammond thinking by showcasing her if he knew she was average talent ? it 's best to burn these songs from someone who already has the cd . the entire cd lacks the anointing . even the bonus video clip on the installed media player , that features joann and donnie mcclurkin sucks . all she does is add libs in spanish , plays some maracas , some castanets and god knows what else and i 'm supposed to bust a move to this ? ! no way ! ! ! two thumbs way , way down ! ! ! a feeble effort by joann . this will definitely leave a sour taste in your mouth , as it did mine .
