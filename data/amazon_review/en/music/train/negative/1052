love the band , not the record . got ta go with the folks who are dbt fans but think they missed a step on this one . yeah , `` february 14 '' and `` gravity 's gone '' are good tracks , but other than that it 's pretty forgettable . i 'm especially bummed by jason isbell 's tunes - what the heck happened ? the tracks he wrote for `` dirty south '' and `` decoration day '' were far and away the best songs on amazing records . now he sounds like a doobie brother or something equally silly . c'mon guys , get it together !
