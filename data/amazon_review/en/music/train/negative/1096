not the wonderful hootie i am used to . i own four other albums and all of them are great . when i pop in a hootie cd i expect to be relaxed by the soothing voice and the familiar sound that accompany one of my all time favorite bands . i buy cd 's and keep those cd 's on the premise that the entire cd is worth keeping . i am not buying a cd for one or two songs , but the cd as a whole . i just bought this album the other day . half of the songs had the familiar feel but the rest could go to waste . i am giving it a 2.5 , because half the album is great .
