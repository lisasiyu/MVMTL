whale sounds this music is pretty intelligent , but not very interesting . the forgettable melodies hardly connect with the complex rhythm lines ; on only one or two occasions on the cd satisfying harmonies come across . i bought this together with nitin sawhney 's `` beyond skin '' , which is an incomparably better cd - sawhney plugs in nicely with earlier work from portishead , hooverphonic , and even the roots . karsh kale however , seems to pay tribute to jean michel jarre 's `` waiting for cousteau '' . during yoga , my teacher wallpapers her lesson with a whale sounds-cd . when i do yoga at home , karsh kale is a neat substitute for that
