everyone please stop mis-leading people w/ 5 stars ! ! ! it 's about 2.5 look , zakk rocks . i 've followed his entire career , so when i say pride and glory is weak , i mean it . the southern rock twinge is actually pretty cool and zakk plays some nice solos on the softer tunes on cd . but it always goes back to the same thing for every artist -- songwriting . it 's just not good here . too many tracks sound alike and the songs are just thrown together . track 5 is ok. rest is mostly filler . nothing you will remember 5 mins . after you change the cd . sorry zakk , but it sounds like you threw this together in 1 drinking binge weekend . good move to kill the pride . now if you want good acoustic and blues from zakk , get book of shadows . it blows away this lame effort . pride and glory should only be purchased from the bargin bin . rock on bls
