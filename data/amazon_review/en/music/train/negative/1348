2 1/2 stars -- ok , but a bit overproduced . `` nonsuch '' is one of those records that i think was doomed to failure -- having constructed ( with a little help from todd rundgren ) a thematic song cycle ( `` skylarking '' ) and an album of perhaps the best pop music in two decades ( `` oranges & lemons '' ) , the bar was set pretty high for xtc , and in an attempt to reach it , they seemed to have overreached a bit . it 's not that the album is bad per se , it 's just so carefully arranged and produced to have lost the edge that made its predecessors so great . the band seems to have distilled themselves down to midtempo numbers , occasionally finding a bit of a driving electric sound ( opener `` the ballad of peter pumpkinhead '' ) , but largely sticking to a quieter , balladry style , often primarily piano driven . sometimes it works out quite nicely , the lovely , chirping staccato guitars on `` humble daisy '' provide ample support for a simply fantastic lead vocal by andy partridge , and certainly the lilting off-rhythm of `` then she appeared '' is downright captivating , but more likely than not , the pieces end up blending one into another as pretty much unmemorable pop songs that are inoffensive and ok but just not attention getting ( colin moulding 's `` my bird performs '' , partridge 's `` the disappointed '' ) . to cap things off , the album stretches over an hour long , and by the end of the record , even the more intriguing material ( `` the ugly underneath '' ) seems to blend in with the rest . it 's tough though , becaue none of it is particularly bad , and in fact , all sorts of neat stuff is going on throughout -- great three part harmonies ( brian wilson style with a falsetto over the top ) catch the ear on `` dear madam barnum '' , `` wrapped in grey '' twists and turns every which way , `` war dance '' features an intriguing clarinet opening that leads into a set of reeds providing support for moulding 's venomous lyrics ... it goes on . in fact , with such detailed arrangements , everything 's guaranteed to be interesting in some regard , but what it lacks is that feeling of spontaneity and energy . one nice thing is that at least with this reissue and its remastered sound , you can make out the subtleties of the record nicely . bottom line , there 's a lot better by xtc -- `` nonsuch '' is an ok record , but they 've done a whole lot more
