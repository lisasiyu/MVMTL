over hyped shlock the kaiser chiefs are supposed to be the next great thing from the uk . give me a break ! these guys are about as stimulating as a coma . mundane has apparently become mainstream . i am probably older than your average reviewer , having purchased jimi hendrix albums when he was still alive , and gone to replacement shows in minneapolis when no one had heard of them but this group does nothing to deserve the praise found in these reviews . i thoroughly enjoy uk rock . i wore out copies of quadrophenia in high school and love bloc party , franz ferdinand , and the music as true progressions and successors to the ranks of who fans who continue to relish british pop and rock . maybe musicianship is not a criteria to go by but i produce more interesting music on my mac than these guys can with a full studio of gear . i have never written a review before , but my disapointment in this cd has driven me to this rant ! i love this uk revival of sorts and solute you all . long live rock ! kaiser chiefs ... learn to play those instruments you suck ! for those of you looking to find the excitement you found in the likes of the jam or the clash look elsewhere . maybe the rakes or maximo park will fill the need
