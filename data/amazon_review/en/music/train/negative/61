song not on cd to those of you interested in this cd in lieu of finding the & quot ; songs with lyrics & quot ; in the movie ice age , got bad news for you . they are not here ! i really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they do n't include the best or features songs in the movie . anyway , the song that pretty much everyone wants when manny , sid , diego and the baby are together and walking towards half peak is called & quot ; send me on my way & quot ; by rusted root . it is on their latest album & quot ; when i woke & quot ; . put rusted root in the amazon search engine and you should find it . hope this helps those looking for this song
