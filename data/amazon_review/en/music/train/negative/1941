release the movie score . the score to cast away is one of my favorites - right up there with ennio morricone 's underrated instrumentals for `` once upon a time in america '' - and it 's a real shame that , apparently , the only album with music from the film is this compilation disc which does n't even feature the full soundtrack . luckily i got my hands on an academy awards advance album preview for cast away - the cd that universal sent to the academy awards crew for oscar consideration - and it has six beautiful tracks . but i know there are more out there and i think it 's time the full soundtrack was released
