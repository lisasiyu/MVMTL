another light-weight single from `` with teeth '' only '' , the second single from `` with teeth '' , has something in common with its predecessor -- its of limited value . i picked it up and was pretty disappointed . the single itself , `` only '' , is n't one of the ones i particularly enjoy on the album -- its got a nice enough funky bass line and drum beat , but reznor 's sing-speak `` down in it '' styled vocal grates and the piece does n't particularly hold my interest . certainly it lacks the immediacy of `` down in it '' , and i 'm generally inclined to want reznor to look forward , not backward . the b-sides are n't much better -- the dfa mix of `` the hand that feeds '' is yet another remix , this one pretty much a full techno mix . it 's quite different , replete with an odd panting sample that gets somewhat irritating as the piece never ends ( it rambles on for well over seven minutes ) . the live version of `` love is not enough '' is the only saving grace on the single -- while its not one of the better songs on the record , its decent enough , and live it got bigger . the arrangement is the same , but its more direct and in your face . for the casual listener , skip this one . the fan will be buying it regardless of what i say , but it 's in line with the recent singles , not the older ( and superior ) ones
