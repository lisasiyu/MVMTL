... brutal planet ... seems too forced ... `` brutal planet '' review : in alice cooper 's long and successful career ( admittedly with ups and downs along the way ) , he has proved ( to me at least ) that he is one of the best lyricist in rock and roll history . albums like `` love it to death , '' `` killer , '' `` billion dollar babies , '' and `` welcome to my nightmare '' are just simply put - brilliant . alice was at the top of his game in the 70 's . however , that is not to suggest that he 's never released worthy material since then . in fact the quite opposite . albums like his 1983 hidden gem `` dada , '' 1991 's `` hey stoopid '' and the brilliant `` the last temptation '' ( 1994 ) is amongst some of alice 's best work . however , in the summer of 2000 , alice unleashed brutal planet , which was produced by bob marlette ( union - `` the blue room '' ) and executive produced by the great bob ezrin . while there are standout tracks like the title track , `` sanctuary , '' and `` take it like a woman '' -- - the album just falls flat . the new musical direction ( nu-metal ) seems too forced which is truly unfortunate because the album boasts some of the best lyrics alice has ever written . musicians : ryan roxie ... guitars phil x ... guitars china ... guitars bob marlette ... bass eric singer ... drums interesting facts : 1 . released by spitfire records , `` brutal '' planet '' peaked at # 193 on the billboard top 200 . 2 . there was a japanese/australian bonus track called `` ca n't sleep , clowns will eat me '' . that title was actually inspired by dialogue spoken in the hit animated show `` the simpsons '' . 3 . the stage show - which can be seen on the `` brutally live '' dvd - is a post-apocalyptic landscape of wreckage that also features the frankenstein machine , a guillotine , two tv`s - and in some cases - three tv 's showing weird video footage all through out the show . packaging : the album cover - which was created by kane roberts ' company planetfx - is a decent and once again , the booklet does feature the album 's lyrics . approx . running time : 48 min . and 4 sec . final analysis : musically the album just plods along and is devoid of any real energy . despite being lyrically well-written , `` brutal planet '' is certainly the most disappointing release from alice since his 1989 album , `` trash '' . **1/2 out of 5 .
