average group dru hill had some alright cuts , but were a dime a dozen r & b group . to me they were a poor man 's jodeci.sisqo had a decent voice , but seemed kind of gimmicky at times . `` tell me '' was a decent cut , but `` in my bed '' was my cut by them.i dug the re-mix.everything else i could take or leave
