sorry to disagree ! i ca n't believe how watered down and lifeless this album sounds ! soul asylum released an absolute winner with `` hang time '' , a perfect blend of pop , punk and metal . with `` and the horse they rode in on '' , i am truly baffled as to what happened . first off , even if you actually like the music here in , the cover is god awful ! ! ! and that title ! what was going on dave pirner 's mind ? ! ? ! now , before you lovers of this album hang me , this release has its moments . `` spinning '' starts off great and it 's a great follow up song to the `` hang time '' album . but from there , the songs are a mixture of hit and miss with no real stand out tracks . and the production makes soul asylum sound as bland as your favorite jell-o flavor . for an ex-hardcore band this is really a low point . the songs sound as if something 's about to happen , but in the end we are left wondering what happened . the irony of it all is that soul asylum 's so called `` sell out '' album ( you know what album ! ) has more balls than this release ! ! ! sad but true , but what 's even sadder is that dave pirner is actually a good songwriter and i 'll have to wonder what made his mind so dry as to put this mediocre album out
