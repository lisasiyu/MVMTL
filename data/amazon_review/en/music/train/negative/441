this is garbage ! ! wow , they actually put this `` anti-classic '' on cd . seriously , this is a very bad album . practically none of the `` superstars '' can sing , other than jimmy hart , and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs . not that they fare too well when they sing `` serious '' songs . nikolai volkoff has a decent baritone voice , but his thick accent renders `` cara mia '' unintelligible . probably the worst singing here is by roddy piper , although captain lou albano gives him a run for the money . if you are a fan of bad celebrity singing , you should get this album
