skip this , get the good songs elsewhere raven on her own is sophisticated , but cheetah girls is for little girls - cheezy ! as are most of these tracks not by real artists with cds , just kids stuck together . 2 of jesse mccartney 's worst songs - sorry ! some chisty c. romano tracks . `` anyone but me '' is a gem , get her ep instead . hayden 's `` my hero ... '' is great also , this girl can sing ! she 's also on the ice princess sndtrck ( `` i fly '' ) which i recommend in addition to `` go figure '' if they let her , she has a huge future
