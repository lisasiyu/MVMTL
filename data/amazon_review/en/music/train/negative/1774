will calm my baby if it does n't drive her crazy first my daughter needs to have music playing when she sleeps . that 's just a fact because we in a house in the city . this is the weirdest cd i have ever heard . it does n't really stop her from crying but it does sometimes put her in this weird daze . it does not help her sleep , in fact , it keeps her from sleeping and after a while , she is agitated until i turn it off . i 'd say if you do n't normally play music for your baby she or she may fall for this . i 'd recommend just playing any cd that you currently own on repeat mode during naps . the point of playing music is so that when a baby re-enters the light sleep phase , normal sounds in the home do n't startle and awaken her . if you feel that you must buy something specifically for your baby to hear , i recommend woody guthrie `` nursery days '' for your baby . it has become the soundtrack of our lives .
