a great vocalist ; a lousy recording my fellow reviewers have one of two things happening : ( 1 ) they received different discs than i , or ( 2 ) they have been smoking some very serious stuff . the average review is five stars ? i can give it only one which is a major disappointment ! why ? although the title of the cd is accurate , the quality of the disk is perfectly terrible . a number of tracks reproduce horribly and no . 2 ( there i go ) is particularly bad . one wonders why the folks that make thse recordings ca n't take the time to make certain that the customer gets a decent recording for his or her money . if original master recordings need to be cleaned up in order to give the listener a fair shake then this needs to be done . this is a perfectly wonderful assortment of vaughn monroe 's recordings . it is a perfectly terrible recording of them
