actually , i like these guys they had a swagger at monterey 67 and were in the right place at the right time . i like about 3 tracks on this album ( their first and best ) . i ca n't recommend it to the masses , i purchased this mainly for historical purposes . you must listen to jefferson airplane ( first 2 albums only ) , peanut butter conspiracy ( first 2 albums only ) , grateful dead ( skip first 2 ablums ) before you dig this deep for lost nuggets
