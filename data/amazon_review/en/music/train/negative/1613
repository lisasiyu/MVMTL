broke boy ( 2 and 1/2 stars ) i 'll state the obvious . rich boy 's southern twang is so thick that its hard to understand what he is saying sometimes . this album has more bad tracks than good tracks so let me focus on the good then the bad . standout tracks : throw some ds is a catchy first single that i didnt like at first and the remix with andre 3000 ( he had the best verse on here ) , nelly , murphy lee , the game is a lot better than the original . boy looka here is an alright second single plus i like how the beat breaks down . and i love you had potential to be a great track till pastor troy delivers a crappy verse on it but big boi held it down on here . lost girls and ghetto rich ( featuring john legend ) are two tracks that are worth hearing plus any song of substance i 'll give credit for . filler : rich boy pulls a rick ross and has way too many chick songs on here like what it do , good things , touch that a** ( the worst out of all of them ) and on the regular . role models is weak and so is the fillerific hustla balla gangsta mack and gangsta . get to poppin has to be the worst plus i 've heard pitbull spit over that same horrible beat ( and that track sucked too ) . bottom line : 6 good songs are a good enough reason to skip this album . yeah it might have some catchy cuts but the album is packed to the rim with skip material .
