who is this ? there are only two artists ' music that i will purchase not having heard one note of the cd . those two artists are barbra streisand and linda eder . `` songs of judy garland '' was a huge disappointment . i was surprised at the cd cover . i do n't know what `` look '' ms. eder was shooting for but she missed the mark . instead of coming off as 10 years younger , she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable . she looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child . ms. eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of `` makeover '' . and the music ... i tried so many times to like it . but the more i listended the more i realized i was listening to `` liza minnelli '' singing her mother 's music . i did not hear linda eder . i 'm begging you ms. eder , go back to what works . i 'm sorry ... this does n't
