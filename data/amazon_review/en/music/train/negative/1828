`` desperately '' poor song selection ... if this album had `` desperately '' on it from `` stick it to ya '' , i would 've bought it in a second . that 's the best song on that album , a hidden gem that got a small amount of airplay nonetheless . and with 8 tunes coming from that album ( as well as 8 from its follow up `` the wild life '' ) , you would 've thunk that `` desperately '' would 've made the cut over ho-hum songs like `` she wants more '' or `` you are the one '' . as such , skip this one , the songs from `` the wild life '' are n't that great anyway . get `` stick it to ya '' instead , it 's a better best-of slaughter collection than this one
