for american twenty-somethings a relentlessly trendoid pastiche intended for the north american kewl market . it cobbles together the offerings of many fine and varied artists , but the association implies that there is a `` new thing '' here - in the sense of the original bossa nova or tropicalia , which is n't the case . rather being something new , it is an example of unassimilated influences . some north american influences have been `` eaten , '' perhaps especially by artists connected with bahia , but that 's not really on the table here . virginia rodrigues career has been stalled from day one because she is essentially unable to use her great voice - she simply ca n't move her butt stylistically - thus , her inclusion here is a bit of unintentional irony . brasil has a tremendously complex folk and pop musical reservoir and a sophisticated modern music industry - this stuff is definitely not the sharpest tooth of the cutting edge
