sentimental , right-wing claptrap darryl worley 's `` have you forgotten '' begs another , more relevant question -- `` do you read the paper . '' despite the fact that hussein 's iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks , he justifies our illegal invasion and occupation of that sovereign nation with references to the twin towers . to xenophobes like worley , the middle east is just one big nation of indistinguishable brown people . he justifies our warmaking with cliched references to `` our freedom , '' apparently oblivious to the irony that the patriot act -- passed in reaction to 9/11 -- has effectively cancelled the bill of rights . he accepts the official version of 9/11 , despite the fact that the story has holes big enough to fly an airplane through . i 've heard some pretty reactionary stuff on country radio before , but this song definitely takes the cake .
