patchy at best and nothing to be so proud except for ray of light , which is one of the best pop songs of 90s , the power of goodbye , beautiful stranger and deeper and deeper . where are the remixes of do n't cry for me argentina , or you must love me or the remake of american pie ? the half of the album is full of silly ballads and r & b-scented numbers like the rubbish it 's human nature , the sleep-inducing ( but mean to be a good ballad ) take a bow which is the same with all babyface songs , bedtime story which is the same as ever with anything bjork has done in the past and so-so secret . frozen seems to be a nice standout but it does n't feel sincere , and more or less sounds like power of goodbye ... and the music album was one of the worst albums madonna crapped out so singles should not be different . all in all , madonna is not a slow number singer ; her voice terribly sounds weaker than her dance numbers and that 's why this greatest hits album was not successful as immaculate collection because the singles were already bad . this album reflects the spiral-down of madonna through 90s to 2000s ( except ray of light where she struck gold ) where she hit the bottom with american life and has not recovered herself . go buy immaculate collection , ray of light album , down load one or two other songs at your disposal and you will have the good things madonna has produced among the heap of redundant mass called pop music .
