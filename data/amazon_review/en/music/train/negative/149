oh , lord ... i was looking at the billboard hot 100 last year like i do every week , and at one point i noticed a song that was making moves was `` grind with me '' by pretty ricky . i had never heard of the song , and after i listened to it , i wished i still had n't heard of the song . i do n't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album , bluestars , but i did and , well , i could n't get the cd out of my stereo fast enough . i agree with reviewer hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group 's street team or something . pretty ricky consists of four people : three rappers ( spectacular , diamond `` baby blue '' , and slick -- and i use the term `` rapper '' loosely ) and one singer ( pleasure ) . the problem with this album is that these are the horniest and most talentless guys i have ever heard of , and that is a terrible combination . the lead single `` grind with me '' is really called `` grind on me '' , and it 's one of the nastiest things i have ever heard , but `` playhouse '' is n't far behind . and `` nothing but a number '' is very , very statutory . also annoying is their use of dated lyrics , like `` if lovin ' you is wrong , i do n't wan na be right '' on `` grind on me '' , or `` if i 'm lyin ' , i 'm flyin ' '' on `` grill `em '' ( what does that even mean , anyway ? ) . the guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs , like `` from the back ! '' on `` get a little closer '' , and `` yes , sir ! '' on `` your body '' . also , while pleasure 's singing is n't horrible , it 's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping . actually , his chorus on `` shorty be mine '' is sure to cause you displeasure . speaking of that song , things are equally unimpressive when the guys do n't talk about sex , like on `` never let you go '' , `` ca n't live without you '' , and the obligatory bling-blingin ' songs `` chevy '' and `` grill `em '' . but in the long run i guess all that does n't matter because nobody cares about pretty ricky any more and as my brother said , they 're probably now back to working at wendy 's . if i ever come across the bluestars cd again , in the words of `` your body '' , dammit , i 'll beat it up . anthony ruper
