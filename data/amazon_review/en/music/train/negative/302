power of marketing ! the power of marketing behind mrs. souza is incredible ! her previous album , brazilian duos , was listed among the best jazz albums of 2001 by new york times - a critic , mr. ben ratliff , had received an advance cd copy and included the album on his list , although the album only would be officially released in april 2002 ... strange ? well , the next year the same mr. ratliff , in the same ny times , included the same cd in his best jazz albums of 2002 list ... then , & quot ; brazilian duos & quot ; got a grammy nomination in march 2003 ... and now , in a few days , this horrible & quot ; north and south & quot ; cd will receive a grammy nomination for best jazz vocal album ... no more comments
