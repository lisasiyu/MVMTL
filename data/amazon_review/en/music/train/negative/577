garbage ... .. this is an awful record . the beats are a complete joke . whoever produced this crap must have been strung out or somethin ' , cuz no1 in there right mind would let this sh** see the light of day . and everyone already knows ja ca n't write so it 's expected that the lyrics would be trash too . forget this record . murder inc is dead
