depressing i love trance music , that style of dance music with fast , continuous beats and rich electronic sounds , and often sweet sounding vocals , usually female vocals . so i thought i 'd like this album . well , i do like it musically . it 's not great , but it 's good trance music . but the lyrics ruin the album for me . most of the songs exude a bitterness toward love relationships or a cynicism that love will never work out . here are lyrical samples from the cd : `` maybe you 're better off without me . '' `` i 'm wide awake , it 's time to make it on my own ; the dream is over . '' `` we wanted love to last forever , but something 's missing ... i ca n't find words to break your fall , when 'goodbye ' says it all . '' `` it gets lonely , but i have no other choice ... no one sees my dreams falling all apart ... i 've been blinded by your lies . i never knew love could be so wrong . '' `` tell me why you ca n't feel the things i do ... i made the same mistakes i know i 'll make again ... it meant nothing to you , you 'll never understand , it meant nothing to you , the touch of my hand . '' `` november 's here again , raining down on me , i disappear again ... '' `` it seems like every [ scrub ? ] i see is trying to get it on with me , they think it impresses me , the way they act so foolishly ... i do n't care , i never liked you anyway ... you 're a total waste of time . '' if these lyrics fit your life , and you like trance music , you 'll probably like this album . i do like the remake of a-ha 's `` the sun always shines on tv . '' it 's not better than a-ha 's 8-minute remix version , but it 's nice to hear an old favorite with a new flavor . this album has three mixes of the song , none of them significantly different from the other . i also like the instrumental track , `` blown away . '' these tracks are enjoyable , and a couple others have pretty nice lyrics , but the album as a whole i find too depressing
