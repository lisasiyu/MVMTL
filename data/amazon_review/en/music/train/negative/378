skip this one , but see him play live . if you want a good hank 3 album , go with lovesick broke & driftin ' . it 's a more impressive and mature work than this one , which seems slapped together and unoriginal . the best songs on risin ' outlaw are the three written by wayne hancock , who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to hank sr . so what you end up with on this disc is hank 3 imitating wayne hancock imitating hank williams , sr. and since wayne hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with , and his performances of his own songs are better than hank 3 's , why not just get the original hancock cds ? the cover of `` thunderstorms and neon signs '' on risin ' outlaw seems particularly pointless , as hank 3 uses an identical delivery , launching into falsettos at the same time , holding certain notes the same way , etc . i can understand why someone would want to cover it -- it 's a beautiful song -- but at least add *something* of your own to it . to use an art analogy , it 's like hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that wayne hancock made , but it is apparent that hank 3 is n't as good of an artist . having said this , risin ' outlaw is still better than 99 % of the trash played on country radio . but i think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album . still , if you get the chance to see hank 3 play live , do n't miss it
