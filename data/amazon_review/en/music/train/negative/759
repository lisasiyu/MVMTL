should be called 'the remixes ' not 'greatest hits' i bought this cd many years ago and just now feel the urge to write a review . i was so disappointed . i mean the original versions of these songs are good but after listened to half a disc i felt remixed out . the remixes become boring and just left me thirsty for the original versions . also did not like the way the songs were broken out . one disc is supposed to be mellow and the other is supposed to be jamming but after listening to the disc i wondered why songs appeared on the wrong disc . there is no flow on these cds . i am still waiting for the proper greatest hits while this one gathers dust . not recommended
