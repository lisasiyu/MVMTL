guitar legend 's debut . in many ways a relic of its era , `` not of this earth '' is the first widely distributed release by joe satriani ( a previous ep ended up being reissued as part of `` time machine '' , years later ) . the guitarist , supported by drummer jeff campitelli and percussionist john cuniberti came into public attention when steve vai , a former student of satriani , ended up singing his teacher 's praises in the music press . the result is that this album , more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music , received wider recognition and poised satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record . the album itself is a bit uneven -- satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist , but as a songwriter , he was n't quite ready . several pieces ( `` not of this earth '' , `` hordes of locusts '' ) seem to run out of steam before they end , and a couple ( `` the snake '' , `` driving at night '' ) feel like bad '80s metal . on the other hand , several pieces shine -- delicate and lovely `` rubina '' , reggaeish and emotionally soaked `` memories '' , and the overtly frippesque `` new day '' are all fine examples of what satriani is capable of . but my favorite is probably `` brother john '' , where satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone . in the end , the album is ok , but satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future . come back to this one if you 've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more , but most should start with `` surfing with the alien ''
