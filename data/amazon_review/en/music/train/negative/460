why ? this is not necessarily an indictment of aimee mann or holiday music ... .though i do find such disks as being cheesey . i was a bit surprised when i heard mann was coming out w/a holiday album . it seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only original material , but non-mainstream music . it has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year . is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with ? there is only so many different ways to cover `` i 'll be home for christmas '' , `` winter wonderland '' - all of which i believe are covered by james taylor , sarah mclachlan and better midler , all of which were released this month . i 'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits . that being said - i still like mann 's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray . `` whatever happened to christmas '' , `` christmastime '' and her original `` calling on mary '' . i also liked the fact that she covered `` you 're a mean one , mr. grinch '' . that seems to suit her more . not my cup of tea - but the songs i mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars
