uneven effort while it seems to be the tendency of many cave fans to drool over anything the man records , this is not an album that is up to par with many of his other efforts . there are some stand out tracks such as `` deanna '' and `` mercy '' , but many of the rest come off as either overwrought or overly bombastic . obviously , if you 're already a fan , you 'll want this disc regardless , but to anyone new to nick cave 's work i recommend his `` best of '' collection or `` the boatman 's call ''
