the most horrible bone cd i 've ever heard ! ! after i heard the new bone cd i had much faith in this new release from layzie , although his previous efforts were all , very admittedly , bombs . and unfortunately this new release was no change for layzie bone . it seems as if a layzie with out the thugs is not a good deal.. with no `` hardcore '' or `` club worthy '' songs , his cd lacks anything truly listenable ... honestly , his lyrics do n't even represent his talent on his solo releases ... will somebody please tell layzie to not release solo albums ! ! he is tarnishing his reputation as a rap artist !
