crescent and more crescent reminds me of how great a period of supreme artistry that coltrane sustained during the last few years of his life . i feel a need to inform all fellow lovers of this period of a little known album , currently out of print , called `` infinity '' that truely ranks with his best . it was rescued from the vaults back in 1972 by alice coltrane who added a string arrangement which truely lends a mysterious quality and produces probably the most unique coltrane recording of all time . i first heard this album as a teenager and its mystic tones were a religious experence for me . there is something about the music that speaks of a man who knows he is near physical death and is searching for a path to eternal life . please note that i accidently gave `` cresent '' a one star rating - i meant to give it five stars .
