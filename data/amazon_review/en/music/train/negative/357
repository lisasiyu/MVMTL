not for audiophiles if you 're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review . that said , this dts disc sounds terrible . why ? 1- if you 're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs , you will hardly recognize them here . the multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix ; in other words , they sound totally different from each other . 2- this disc does n't have the fidelity of the sony re-mastered abraxas . the tape hiss is very noticeable , and the overall sound is very dull . just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley . save your money and `` maybe '' someday sony will release a multi-channel sacd from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd
