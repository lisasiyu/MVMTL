classy goth type stuff . the music can be explained and defined pretty much as the title itself just think of `` classic '' . i assumed the music was going to be very club material that has a history of songs being played after the years by clubs.. a large portion of the cd i can not see it as a gothic `` club '' material esspecially throwing in some type-o.. i been through alot of clubs and i can not find a way to hit that song in the dance floor.. if not i guess i have been in the wrong places.. it looks to me they ran out of ideas and threw in some mainstream that everyone listens to so they would i was very dissapointed in the whole cd . listened to a few songs here and there , if you are into the old stuff then this is the stuff for you.. i really dont recomend this cd to any collection besides you want to be blasted in the past .
