bummer -- -barely average well , i gave this cd its first spin after a two year absence of any ricky martin music in my life . after his 1999 self-title cd , i pretty much went head over heals for ricky . when this cd came out in november of 2000 i was really excited . upon first listening to it , i thought it was better than his 99 cd but no where near as good as vuelve . it would take 2003 's almas del silencio to really wash way the bad taste in my mouth that this cd leaves . as several folks know , ricky was under pressure from his managers , producers and the record company to deliver a follow up to his 1999 cd . sound loaded is what we got . this album was obviously rushed and it sounds like it . weak lyrics and over saturation of musical gimicks is utilzed to keep the 'livin la vida loca ' fever burning . ricky 's voice just sounds tired and worn out . it 's easy to tell that he was way over due for a vacation . there are a few standout tracks on the disc . 'amor ' by far out shines every song by a mile . had sound loaded had more great tunes like 'amor ' on it , the cd would have been a hit . as it is , the cd is mediocre at best .
