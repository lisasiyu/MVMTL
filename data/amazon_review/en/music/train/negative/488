another drop in the bucket i saw this on a `` best of 2005 '' list and i have to say i am disappointed . the musicality of this record is not too bad . it 's not terribly creative , but it is enjoyable . what really turned me off was the incredibly vapid and thoughtless lyrics . unfortunately this is just another pop record , of which there are way too many these days . the only track on here that i would give a second listen too is seagull . i would n't recommend the rest of the album
