supergroup , huh ? damn yankees was a supergroup containing ted nugent , tommy shaw ( styx ) , jack blades ( nightranger ) and someother guy . all talented musicians , who are best heard in their prespective groups . damn yankees just does n't rock , like it should . i 've given it a chance and just ca n't get into it . a lot of talent involved , just does n't do anything for me
