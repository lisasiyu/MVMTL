this is not the complete best of fleetwood mac ! to call this the best of fleetwood mac is a little far-fetched -- it does not include any of their hits and great songs from 1967-1974 , forgetting the songwriting of peter green , danny kirwan , and bob welch..it is not a complete so called greatest hits without including the early era -- the title should have read-fleetwood mac-the best of stevie nicks and lindsey buckingham . i am not knocking this lineup and i love the songs but my favorite is fleetwood mac -- the blues -- the roots . i suggest the then play on album to get a really good idea how fleetwood mac was before stevie and lindsay.. also , do not forget bob welch and mystery to me album -- another gem ! ! !
