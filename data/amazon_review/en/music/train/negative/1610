one of those shows that title probably gives the wrong impression . but there are a few different types of musicals . the ones that you have to see to understand , the ones you can just listen to and get the jist of it , and then those that some one has to explain it to you after you 've seen and listened to it . this show is one that you have to see . i have n't seen the show , so this revue is based soley on my impression after listening to it , and i wasnt really entertained . a good bit of the music is tap dancing , and that just inst as thrilling as it would be if you were seeing it . so , know that a good bit of what you will be listening is tap dancing . the actual singing has some good moments . its also has some extremly grating moments , which may have been for effect in the show , but not pleasent to listen to . i would definitly listen to samples of as many songs as you can before you decide to buy this one . collectors should get it just because they collect , but others should probably not by this one blindly . if your getting a gift for someone who likes `` musicals '' this wouldnt be one to get . fav song : `` lynching blues ''
