huge disappointment this album will only appeal to die hard ub40 fans and not casual fans or fans who loved the old up tempo sound of ub40 on lol 1 and 2 . this album only has 2 up tempo songs that sound like the old ub40 from the early 80 's and early 90 's . download the songs come back darling and mr . fix it , so you can save your money . i love ub40 , but after listening to lol 1 and 2 i thought lol 3 was going to be a classic , but it is not close compared to the previous lol albums and seems like it was just put out to make a quick buck because there was no passion in the music and singing , which made the entire album boring or like reggae elevator music until i heard the two songs i already mentioned and recommend downloading . those two songs saved the album in my opinion , otherwise it would have gotten zero stars .
