is it me.. ? i bought this album because i am always interested in finding great new artists and music . i love sarah mclachlan , emm gryner , indigo girls , jem -- things along that line . so i thought i would love courtney jaye . but i just ca n't . i think it 's terribly simplistic , predictable and unimaginable . i like her voice , but combined with the simple lyrics , unoriginal themes and repetitive tunes , i just have to turn her off after a couple songs . i tried to be open-minded ( i even like some kelly clarkson and natalie imbruglia songs ) but i do n't hear the talent
