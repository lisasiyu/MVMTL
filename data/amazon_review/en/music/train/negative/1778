from a barry manilow fan ... warning : some of the songs listed on the box are abbreviated versions and should be listed as such . they fade out half way thru the song . i was very disapointed . would be much better in chronological order . it is in some places , but then jumps around for no apparent reason . it seems like barry attempted to show what a talented entertainer he is , and he is very talented . it is just this box set tries to do too many things , and accomplishes nothing . it just tries too hard .
