just does n't compare to first album i wanted to like this album , but it simply does n't compare to leftism . leftism was way ahead of it 's time and is full of sounds that practially tickle your ears whereas rhythm & stealth is full of sounds that are ugly and not nearly as pleasant to listen to . this is my synopsis and apparently i 'm not alone as this cd sells for much cheaper on the used market than leftism . my advice ? do n't miss leftism but skip rhythym & stealth
