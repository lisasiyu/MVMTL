the only classic song is a cover song ... ... this is a subtle tip off that this album is not worth buying . not for more than fifty cents . like i said , the only good song on here is the rolling stones cover `` i 'm free '' . and i even like the soup dragons ' rendition better than the stones ' original . but the fact remains that the rest of this album is a dull drudgery of a mess to get through . this album is practically a single for `` i 'm free '' , but with twelve extra songs of filler you 'll never listen to more than once ( if at all ) . hmmm . what else can i say about `` i 'm free '' ? oh , yea ... the music video for the song is quite awesome . its so trippy and tie-dyed out ! but that still does n't change my review . or stoic state of mind . one star out of five
