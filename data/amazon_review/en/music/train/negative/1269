wank fest in your face . i am a huge mars fan , but this is just bore . i was really looking forward to a cd representive of their live shows , but this is a horrible excuse for a live album from anyone especially from mars volta . i am all for experimentation , but if you look at the liner notes there are a ton of non-band members jerkin ' off on this after the original recording and personally coming from a recording and engineering backround it is not creative or good . it seems like a bad painting . save your money and buy bootleg of their actual live show .
