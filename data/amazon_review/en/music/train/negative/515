disappointed my first exposure to leonard cohen was hearing allison crowe singing `` hallelujah . '' i was awestruck so i decided to get the essential leonard cohen . bad decision ! the man barely breaks out of a monotone and sounds like he 's terrified that someone will hear him above the accompaniment . he 's another artist who should continue writing but let others perform his works
