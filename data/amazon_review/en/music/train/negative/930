it took me 4 months to buy ... .now i know why although this album is a bit more insightful and less materialistic than his previous work , with the exception of blueprint which is a classic and in a class of its own , i was n't so anxious about him coming back or this album in general . he should 've retired after blueprint if he wanted to do it while he was ontop . the black album was alot better than the blueprint2 which was one disc so-so to good and second disc made of 90 % filler . while this album shows a more storytelling , poet side of jay-z , it ai n't exactly his best work . actually this falls down at the bottom , right beneath his 1997 vol 1 album . while his maturity as an artist has improved , his lyrical content has suffered . the first 5 songs are classic jay-z and the last two songs are classic hip-hop but the rest of the album in between sound more like demos of mc such & such . in my opinion , he has faltered quite a bit on this album , this is right under blueprint2 ; blueprint2 should 've never been two discs let alone be a sequel to a hip-hop classic . kingdom come has a few good moments starting with the intro and leaving at lost one , then coming back with minority report and ending altogether with beach chair , which could 've had a better song title given the point of the song . beyonce , usher & ne-yo , john legend and chrisete could 've been more utilized than singing hooks , let alone singing hooks on so-so songs . more thought could 've been put into the album to make it a 3 , and more could 've been covered to make it a 4 . but jay is starting to let his def jam position affect him .
