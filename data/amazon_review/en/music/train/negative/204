some really curious musical choices hamstring this recording . there are several questions i have after listening to this cd . why are the tempos so crazy ? the opening number plods along like a funeral march , while at the ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank . part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track . why does everything sound so thin ? these orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings . on this cd , it 's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life , sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound . sometimes , obviously live instruments sound like midi . usually it 's the sound engineer 's job to make the opposite happen ! why are the vocals so `` hot '' ? in the obc , there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra . now it 's the vocals that tear at the balance . who cast this show ? i 'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude , but -- oh screw it . you deserve to know . this cassie is some serious vocal ugly . i did n't once wonder along with zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line , like i did with ms. donna mckechnie 's fabulous triple threat . why not update some of the orchestrations ? i have a deep and abiding respect for jonathan tunick ( who is among my top three favorite broadway creative types ) , but it 's 2006 . wah wah pedals are out . overall , although this cd is good for completists , it 's not going to knock the obc recording out of it 's slot as the definitive a chorus line recording . if you do n't have a chorus line cd and are trying to decide which one to buy , track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast . it 's vintage , but it has a raw warmth that is missing from the revival cast
