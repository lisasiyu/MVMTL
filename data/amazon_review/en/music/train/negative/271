give the drummer some ; some real drums . kim waters is one of the nicest persons one could meet , but that still does not prevent me from giving a brutally frank review that will hopefully help him in the future . while i could tell that considerable time was put in this project , that drum machine killed this effort . the music here is so mechanical and irritating from that drum machine , i just ca n't stand to listen to it . the drum machine cheapens the sound so much that i can not recommend this cd to real music lovers especially those with decent audio systems . the only composition that sounds like real music is `` daydreaming '' , but this too is somewhat marred by that mechanical drum machine although less than the others . kim , please use real drums from now on . you are a seasoned smooth jazz artist with great talent , but you cheapen your production relying on a drum machine . that machine sounds mechanical with no spontaneity . you are too advance as an artist to have to rely on it . it may cost a little more for a real drummer , but you are in a class where real drums are indispensible
