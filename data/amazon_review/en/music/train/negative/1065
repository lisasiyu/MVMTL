on par with xi , x-factor in maidens mediocre second coming lets get 1 fact out : iron maiden doesnt care anymore ! ! ! how can they be so brilliant with # of the beast , piece of mind & powerslave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with x-factor ? this record is soooo boring ! i bought it based on wickerman which i found to be ok , reminiscent of the old iron maiden & then they just ran completely out of material . track 2 on sounds exactly the same , long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track , album after album . does `` dream of mirrors '' ever end ? i cant ever tell.. i just lose my attention due to its such a gd drag . then they hit me with `` thin line '' which is even less interesting than the most boring professor i had in the most boring class in my entire college career . you cant listen to the original `` iron maiden '' release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it , unless you just dont care . obviously they dont care ! ! this record is terrible ! if they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end iron maiden & come out with a new band named `` too old , too tired ! '' & quit defiling the great name of `` iron maiden ''
