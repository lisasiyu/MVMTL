if it was possible to give 0 stars , i would have this cd is just plain horrible . it lacks in real talent and it is as cliche as you can get . hey , the grateful dead was a good band , but new hippie-wanna-be bands just do n't have the talent . the only people who buy these albums are just 14 year old freshmen in high school looking for an excuse to be & quot ; popular. & quot ; well , my bashing has been done , so i will leave you on this note ; if you hear twinkle-twinkle-little-star music once , does n't it just get plain boring
