i wanted so badly to like this . i really could n't wait to get this cd . i wanted so badly to like it . but - it is just too bluegrassy for me . every single song . it would be great one or two songs , but every song gets old . plus , the recording quality does n't seem that great . you can barely hear the words , and most kids want to sing along . jenny jenkins is a fun song , and shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful , but for the kids and no ! are way better cd 's
