hey dudes ! hey , did n't you have a girlfriend who liked this guy ? remember driving around , another sat nite of getting nowhere , hearing this guy , `` maggie may '' , thinking , `` did n't they just play that already ? '' remember beer-soaked carpets , butts and roaches lying around , stoned and drunk and bored ? remember the stories about this guy getting hauled into an er at four in the morning in new york or la or someplace , what they pumped out of his stomach ? is is still around ? does somebody still listen to him ? hey , is this the same guy as joe cocker ?
