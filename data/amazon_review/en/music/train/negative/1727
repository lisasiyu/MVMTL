a rhino dissapointment-very incomplete what i have come to expect of rhino is thoroughness , and this cd certainly is not thorough , although what is here is of course done very well . where are the hits half the way , why have you left the one you left me for , etc ? i think this could have been a great collection if made longer , or possibly even a two cd set , although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that ... ... too bad , it remains a & quot ; couldve been great & quot ; ... ..
