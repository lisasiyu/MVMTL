anyone who raps about 9/11 is trash i love hip hop and anything that has a beat to it and i liked 'it 's goin ' down ' when i heard it on the radio . however , i just listened to sample tracks on amazon for this cd and came across 'dope boy magic . ' when i heard him rap about 9/11 i was immediately turned off and enraged . how could he rap about something that tragic ? ! does he think it boosts his image or will sell him more records ? ! hopefully not ! this is disgusting ! i hope anyone that wants to buy this piece of crap listens to 'dope boy magic ' ( and more than likely others too , but i did n't stick around to listen ) before purchasing to see for themselves what a sob this guy is .
