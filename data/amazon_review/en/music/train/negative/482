overrated do n't get me wrong , there 's some great stuff here : behind blue eyes , substitute , bargain , wo n't gget fooled again , baba o'reilly , a few others . but if the who are going to be in the co. of the all time greats , there should n't be any filler on a 2 disk set anthology . they 're the most overrated band in rock history . tried to be rockin ' and rollin ' rock and roll while at the same time putting a lot of effort into concept albums , did n't get the mix right . pink floyd mastered the concept album 'per se ' , david bowie gave us the concept album that really was n't ( rise & fall of zig strdst & spdrs frm mrs ) , while tommy , 4ophenia , and the one that was aborted ( i forget the working title ) fall short , somewhere in between . just as the who fall short , somewhere in between the beatles , stones and led zep . daltrey as a great frontman ? gim me a break ; not worthy of shining the shoes of jagger or plant , not even ozzy ( in his prime with sabbath ) or ian gillan ( deep purple ) . he does n't even sing on some of their most famous songs , and he did n't write any of them ( to go by the liner notes that came with this disc , anyway ) . many of their songs are described as quirky . 'silly ' is closer to the mark . how 'bout just 'dumb ' ? the stones declared that 'time was on their side ' and marched defiantly in the face of all obstacles , including time itself . the who promised that they would die before they got old , on the other hand , and failed to deliver . this was my last attempt to 'get into ' a band that i used to feel guilty for never having 'gotten into
