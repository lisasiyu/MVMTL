i do n't like it i bought this album thinking that it would be good ... boy was i wrong ! ms. mcbride did not do these songs justice by the way she sang them . rose garden , for example is my favorite song , and is sung by lynn anderson ... it was the most beautiful song ever and you could almost feel the rose garden as lynn was singing . marting sang the song like it was a meaningless song ... no feeling , emotions , etc . the rest of the songs sounded crummy too . save your money and buy the orginal artist who sang the songs .
