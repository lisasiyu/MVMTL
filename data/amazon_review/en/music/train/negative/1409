i agree with others i agree with others this cd has been very badly put together . the sound is harsh . i thought there was something wrong with my hi-fi . it is such a shame as we 've been waiting so long and jon 's music is so brilliant . i do n't know if anyone else has noticed too but the title track fades out too quickly .
