mmmmm ... . the reason i can never fully like this album is because of what it created in it 's wake , the `` float on '' kids . i 've been listening to modest mouse since when they began and i am disappointed going to a show and having a thousand kids scream at the top of their lungs for that song . if you listen to any of their other stuff , you will realize that it sounds nothing like original modest and they have made their first `` mass produced '' superhit . the album has it 's moments with `` blame it on the tetons '' and `` the world at large '' but `` dance hall '' and `` satin in a coffin '' bring it down . if you enjoyed listening to modest mouse before this cd came out , do n't buy it . you will be disappointed
