e-40 - my ghetto report card you got to be kidding me right ? people actually giving this album 5 stars . wow people are so blind it is n't even funny . this is all commercialized garbage . e-40 is all on this `` hyphy '' tip now , lmao how wack is that . hyphy is straight wack , the lyrics have no concept what so ever . all pointless . production , well yea all these commercialized albums got production , like this album . but then again where are the lyrics ? this is one of those albums where you sit there and like it only because of the beat/hook lol . people that listen to this type of music dont like real hip-hop , as i said theyre blind . people that arent big hip-hop fans , i dont criticize you for listening , but all you people that claim to be hip-hop fans , f*** outta here , you aint . this album is for commercial rap listeners only , if you like underground stay away from this at all costs . pick up some real hiphop instead . peace .
