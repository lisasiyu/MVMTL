just ok i think beyonce has talent & is one of those musical acts with that certain `` it '' , but at the same time her musical tendency 's tend to be over the top . vocally she goes overboard & over things tend to bring down her attempts at what she is trying to get to . this song is just part 2 of `` crazy in love '' which was a better track . this song sounds like it jacks teena marie 's 'square biz '' . bringing back jay z is a waste of time because his rap on here makes no sense whatsoever . her vocal runs are nice & the channeling of tina turner is cool in places , but more records like this show while beyonce has a pressence along with charisma & is a foxxy mama , but making another so-so track is not a good look at a career that could & should be something special in time
