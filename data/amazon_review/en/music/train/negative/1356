unfortunate i bought this album unheard because i was such a fan of prince . bad move . i agree with the last reviewer . i tried to like it . i really did . but , there is nothing on here worth listening to , let alone dancing to . the subject matter did n't bother me ( he 's certainly been controversial before ) , but i listened to the entire album straight through and could n't tell where one song began and another ended . bored now . only buy this if you 're a completist
