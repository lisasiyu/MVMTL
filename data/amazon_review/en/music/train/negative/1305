feh this album is written for people that are emotionally 16 years old and insane . every song is from the point of a disenfranchised boy moaning at the world . the end of 'i 'm gon na love her for both of us ' , when he keeps saying the title with different inflections ... do n't you just picture rainman rocking in a corner somewhere ? and if she does n't love him back , he 'll kill her ! unless she 's in bed with a group of his best friends ? ? no wonder 'everything is permitted . ' this is bad . the production is bad , the tone of the guitar is godawful , meat 's voice sounds worse on this cd than any of his others by far ( i know he lost his voice and was doing weird things to try to get it back . i do n't hold it against him , but i 'm the one that has to listen to it . ) the band is fine , and i like some of the actual music . it 's the song titles and lyrics that are awful
