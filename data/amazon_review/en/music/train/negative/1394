a load of c*ap white lion were just a rip off of van halen , except vh were better . i ca n't believe some of these reviews , i have listened to this album intensely , the guitar player was copying eddie vh not only on his tapping , but wangy bar and riff building . the songs make you wan na heave , & quot ; little fighter & quot ; , & quot ; when the children cry & quot ; and & quot ; love do n't come easy & quot ; , this was just a sad attempt at trying to cash in with the glam rock chart material of the time , but they failed . if this is the best of , then i 'd hate to imagaine what the worst of sounds like , cause it must be diabolical
