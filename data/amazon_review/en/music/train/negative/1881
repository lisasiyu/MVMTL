weak orchestral arrangements + not ottmar 's best i am a fan of ottmar 's work so i did not hesitate when i found a copy of this album for sale . though not a terrible record it is not what your average ottmar fan has come to expect . the orchestral arrangements are clumsy or forgettable at best - inappropriate and dischordant at worst . ottmar 's guitar work is mostly relegated to plinking along - sometimes in a slightly dissonant fashion - on top of the orchestral arrangements . none of it is horrible , and a few cuts are even interesting , but my guess is that the typical ottmat leibert fan wo n't be listening to this cd more than once or twice . there are far better choices for anyone who likes ottmar 's work . stick with his more popular stuff and save having to trade this in for somethign else ( as i will be doing )
