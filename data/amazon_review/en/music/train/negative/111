not a very good debut ... tony yayo 's `` thoughts of a predicate felon '' suffers from the fact that tony yayo simply does n't know who he is ( or who he is supposed to be ) on this album . before i listened to this album , i expected to hear gritty , descriptive rhymes about yayo 's criminal life . unfortunately however , i , like many of you , tuned into tracks such as `` tattle teller , '' `` curious , '' and `` project princess . '' for an ex-convict , that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more ... hardcore ; something better . on tracks such as `` live by the gun '' and `` homicide , '' yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for `` harder '' lyrics , but tracks such as these are few and far between . hopefully tony yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now , this debut album is simply a dissapointment
