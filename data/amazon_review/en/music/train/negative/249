long time fan , very mad . bought this cd quite a while ago . it is probably very good , but how can i tell when it wo n't play on my stereo ? this dual disc format is the music industries way of screwing long time fans . this sticking it to the fan is about as low as it gets . after buying the disc , i noticed the tiny warning on the back that says `` audio side of disc does not conform to cd specifications and therefor not all cd players will play the audio side of this disc . '' what a great idea : sell a disc to people that wo n't play for everybody . thanks a..holes
