no go . yeah ... .this cd bit . i bought chillout sessions 4 last year , and looked forward to buying this compilation as well . unfortunately , it did n't live up to the last one . out of the 20 or so tracks on the first cd , i liked 2-3 ... and they were all on other compilations i already own . the same was true for the second cd . this was not worth the money . i was very disappointed
