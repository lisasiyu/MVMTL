a sonic assault i remember that just before i bought this in 1993 i was pretty fed up with the state of guitar playing . at the time , the gloom and doom of the latest wave had settled over the world of guitar playing like a rain cloud . this guy turned it all around for me . i have seen and heard some of the greatest guitar players more than once but what danny did on this album is mind boggling . the thing is , it is pure , honest , beautiful , mean , technically impressive , music . just a box of ear candy . if you appreciate a good guitar player than you are in for a treat . there has never been anybody whom i recommended this album to that was disappointed .
