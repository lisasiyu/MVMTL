very pretty , somewhat boring this recording of the new works by theofanidis and higdon is first rate . great performances , and nice to hear along side the copland , which stands out as the real masterpiece . mind you , theofanidis and higdon are obviously really talented composers . i like new music . i like beautiful music . and i do n't usually mind if the new music i hear is beautiful or ugly , has a tune , or not . what matters is that i am pulled in , and not lulled in with cliches or pandering . the theofanidis seemed to be much more interesting to listen to than the higdon . his sense of orchestral color is very strong . but overall , their music is very pretty , and somewhat boring . get this to hear that great copland : it is the piece that on this cd that pulls you in to listen . i know this piece is not the new piece on the cd , but it really stands the test of time against the more recent works
