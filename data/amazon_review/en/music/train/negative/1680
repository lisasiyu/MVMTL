moving smartly along ... well , let 's put it this way ... i bought this when the vinyl was first released . went with all the other app albums i had . my 700 or so vinyl discs have since been entrusted to an old friend . i 've since purchased *almost* all the app cds that i once had on vinyl . not this one . for me , pyramid was the pinnacle -- 5 stars . love the rest of the first four , as well as stereotomy and gaudi -- 4 stars . i 'd give 3 stars to vulture culture and eye in the sky . but this one and eve just did n't do it for me . on a tangentially related note ... if you have n't heard godley & creme 's goodbye blue sky , try to find yourself a copy . a rollicking good time
