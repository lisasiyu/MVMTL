a mistake to be honest , i must have hit a button by mistake which caused me to order something i really had n't intended on buying . there was no way to cancel it on-line so i figured i 'd give the cd a listen , since i had nellie 's first cd , which i love . i must say , i was disappointed . just seemed like every song sounded the same . maybe it will grow on me , the more i listen to it , but kinda doubting it
