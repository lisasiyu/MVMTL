cold salsa your love by laura branigan is the reason that i bought this cd . it is the only reason that i 've kept it all of these years . her immense vocals can knock down walls at one second and caress your heart the next . one of the , if not the most overlooked vocalists ever . spanish harlem by ben e. king , of course , is another great song but you do n't need to by this soundtrack for it . the rest of the cd is throw away . but for the laura branigan song alone it 's worth the money . it 's the only reason i gave this album two stars ! if atlantic records ever releases a box set for her , or remasters her albums with this song on either , this cd will be turned in to a used cd store & quot ; pronto ! & quot ;
