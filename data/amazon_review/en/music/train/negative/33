nice try ! the restoration of a vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece . motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life . like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost , reconstructing motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming , and becoming as inspired as vivaldi . in listening to motezuma , one can pick up the original vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part picasso part michelangelo . as much as such painting can be taxing to the eye , portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear . except for several arias and the two sinfonias , the music has a touch and taste of the 1800 's , but not of the baroque settecento . the juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive , and just does not work . it makes at times the orchestration devoid of the vivaldi unf , charm , and texture . nonetheless , motezuma 's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as d'ira e furor armato , la figlia lo sposo , gl'otraggi della sorte , d'ove la figlia ? , s'impugni la spada , and performances by vito priante , inga kalna , and marijana mijanovic . bravo for vito priante and his interpretation of gi'otraggi della sorte , and d'ove la figlia . he does a great ornamentation in the da capos , and turns up the volume in all the right notes . just like `` terribile lo sento '' , and `` orribile lo scempio '' , `` gi'otraggi '' shares the same musicalization . somehow , this version of the score is especially more dramatic and subtlely more melodic .
