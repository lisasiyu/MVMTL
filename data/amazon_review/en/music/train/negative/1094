just bad constantine maroulis may be easy on the eyes , but thei s cd is awful . a bit to hardcore for a debut albumn . maybe payback for not getting further in ai , i really think he can sing and does have talent , when he did david cassidy 's i think i love you , it was a good take on a old 70 's song . then when he did queens bohmeian rhaposdy it sent shivers down my bones , ( no freddy ) but not bad . sorry this is just a disappointment , better luck next cd . this may have been a let down to his fans , not to mention that ai has a large pre teen audience not to mention how many parents would go out and buy this cd , for it surely would have a explicit warning label on it
