a little disappointed i was given this cd from my sister , who knows i love to dig into up and coming bands . i was not impressed . the only song i found to be fairly original , in at least the sound , was in the woods , which i would n't list as the fulcrum this album turns on . the remainder of this album disappointed me with its appeal to emotion that was trying a little too hard ( as is the style these days ) , hammering out repeated chords and vocals that have that familiar deep delicate sound . now , i do n't like coldplay . i do n't have any of their albums . i hate to say this , but it almost sounds like levy is really trying to pull off some coldplay covers . make sure you listen to the samples before you buy this cd , because i 'd hate for someone to accidently buy a rush of blood to the head part ii .
