come on people ... there is a reason why record companies who carry bands like earth , sunn 0 ) ) ) and teeth of lions rule the divine ask very little for their albums : its nothing but noise . you would think that a band putting together three tracks adding up to well over 60 minutes of music would have something of worth on them . well , do n't expect it . trying to make it through any of these band 's work is like trying to sit through the film shaoh without an intermission . granted , i do n't smoke weed , so i guess that leaves this music to those of you who are n't doing anything with your lives and who probably still play dungeons & dragons in your parents basement , while listening to the likes of earth , sunn 0 ) ) ) and teeth of lions rule the divine . it just seems ironic and deeply sad that one must get blazed in order to like this `` music '' . drone metal was invented because the creators knew that there would be a massive following of losers just waiting to gobble up something that appeared to be visionary and original . i will admit , i have one drone metal album , teeth of lions rule the divine . i attained it because so many people on amazon made this stuff sound as if it was the second coming of christ . please , do not waste your money . this is nothing but a novelty act that has long over stayed its welcome
