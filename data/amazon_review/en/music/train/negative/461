funny like haha this review is pretty funny you have to admit ... .. `` this band has the most retarded lyrics i 've ever heard - `` sometimes the sun goes down , sometimes it goes back up , i 'm wondering which one you are watching now . '' huh ? ? forget about the singer 's gross melodramatic voice or the band 's boring decision to steal riffs from the strokes - just check out those lyrics ! ! the sun does n't 'sometimes ' go up and down , it always goes up and down - always - you morons . `` i 'm wondering which one you are watching now . '' which one ? excuse me , last time i checked , we have only one sun , not two . whatever . maybe these hipsters should 've spent more time in school and less time working on their hair . their first record was trying to sound like weezer and now they 're trying to sound like hot hot heat . how lame is that ? and why are these guys trying so hard to look like the strokes ? they even have that token dude with the caucasion 'fro . i was suckered into seeing these guys at spaceland last month and overheard the singer `` pep-talking '' his band . so embarassing . `` okay , guys , have fun tonight but make it look natural . you never know who might be in the audience . and do n't forget , those fat girls in the front row bought some merch so pretend to be nice to them and we 'll make fun of them later . '' cool guys . ''
