a band between trains from the live disc , astronomy domine is the strongest selection but is marred by a poor original recording and thoughtless transfer to disc . the bass track is almost nonexistent robbing this song of its thunder . the other three tracks are good , not great , performances of what are perhaps their first important post-syd barret compositions . they are definitely not the band they used to be . the studio disc is a mess . the first part of david gilmour 's suite is the best bit , some nice blues guitar . like disc one , disc two sounds muddy . my overall impression is that the band was in the process of just starting to grow out of their psychedelic jam band britches but had n't yet figured out what to put on next . live disc=3 stars ; studio disc=1 star ; net rating=2 stars
