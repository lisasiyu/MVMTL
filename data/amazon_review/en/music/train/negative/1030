skip it ! i hate this music because it is boring , stupid , and downright weak . let 's go over the songs . 1 . `` the tide is high 0/10 i hate this song ! blondie is the worst group in music history . 2 . `` dancing queen '' 0/10 i hate abba to no end ! 3 . `` i just do n't know what to do with myself '' 0/10 i hate dusty springfield until armageddon comes . i hate this album because it does not have any music of the macabre , sinister , and devilish . so if you want music then look somewhere else , otherwise , stay clear of this mess
