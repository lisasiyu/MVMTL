bmg ruined elvis ' blue christmas i wish i had never owned the original recording of this album because this `` version '' is a sorry compilation disc distributed by bmg/sony that hardly compares to the original . if you can find the original , get that , for this compilation disc does not contain some of the selections and suffers greatly for it
