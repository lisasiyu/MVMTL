ugh i bought this cd based on the other reviews . and when i got it , wow , i was very disappointed . this cd is not good at all . it may be good to those of you who like dashboard confessional and stuff like that , but it 's not to my liking . i recommend anadivine , coheed and cambria , or armor for sleep well over this cd
