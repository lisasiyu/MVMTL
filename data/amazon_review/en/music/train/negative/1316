great beginning sad ending ! lisa lisa & amp ; cult jam , guilty pleasure of the middle 80 's scene , she was the queen of freestyle by that time , her music was around every club , and her style will remain in many people minds . her sounds were extremely danceable , although some people thought that her voice was a little bit squirky and anoying , it fitted just great to the type of music she wanted to approach , even her hit ballad & quot ; all cried out & quot ; a bittersweet melody with amazing lyrics , that will be covered later by many , fitted her just great , but undoubtly her greatest achievment was dance music , & quot ; head to toe & quot ; , & quot ; lost in emotion & quot ; , where # 1 's the same year and make everybody love this , sadly she became lost in more pop oriented tunes with the next albums , saving only & quot ; let the beat hit em & quot ; that it 's truly a comeback to the dance music scene , but too late , the magic was lost and we should point to & quot ; little jackie wants to be a star & quot ; as guilty for throwing lisa 's career to oblivion , but if you forget that and concentrate on the early materials you will find an artist that surface out of the bunch , because they were talented and had a new flavor to offer to the public
