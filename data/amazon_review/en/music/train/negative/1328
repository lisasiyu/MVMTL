why did you this to us , rick ? why ? oh my god ... how can be possible that such a talented composer had to fall in such deep nonsense , remaking a whole bunch of old tunes to end up like something much worse than even muzak ? this is the music you 'll hear again and again at the supermarket , just sufficiently engineered to num the brain . kiss of life is the only light of hope ( and that 's why this cd gets 1 star - otherwise should be zero , or even negative ! ) but that 's only because i love sade
