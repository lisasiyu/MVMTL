worst chicago album to me ! i can see why i saw the cassette version of this album in $ 1.99 bins in the '90s . chicago 's 21st album was the worst album to me , easily the worst i 've heard from them . the album sounds so boring , and the performances sound so uninspiring . even the diane warren-written song sounds lousy , typical of her sappy ballad pap ! there 's not one memorable song on here , compared to classics like if you leave me now , love me tomorrow or others . do n't hear a lot of their famous horns , only keyboards and pop songs . and ron nevison produced this overproduced , overwrought fluff ? if chicago , with their extensive catalog , even thinks about performing one song from this album live , you might want to walk out of the theater to get concessions . they are too multi-talented a band to let themselves get through this commercial flop that this album was in 1991 !
