there are worse albums than this one ... ... but i listen to them even less ! i bought this album at random a few years ago . my first impression after i bought it was & quot ; mediocre british band & quot ; . i 've listened to it a couple times since then , the most recent today , and my impression has n't changed . if it were n't for the fact that brian eno contributed to this album i 'd probably give it one star
