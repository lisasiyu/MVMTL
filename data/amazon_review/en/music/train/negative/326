2 1/2 stars- what this musical lacks i 'm sure this wo n't win me any popular votes but , this musical is one that i feel i have to comment on . what has happened to broadway ? why has london 's west end taking over the musical theatre industry ? well , when broadway produces musicals such as `` little women . '' as a fan of the book i had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as `` the secret garden '' or `` jane eyre . '' but , this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage . the songs are mindless garbage with no feeling , depth , or emotion and listening to the cd is what one broadway fan might consider torture . there are a few exceptions `` take a chance on me '' and `` small umbrella in the rain '' somehow manage to stand out but , are not enough to save this show from a slow death on broadway . the cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play ... susan foster who is well known as millie does a decent job as joe but , misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character joe . danny gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a tony nomination ... i can only hope he makes a few cds after this show . it 's obvious why when you listen to `` little women '' - how it came to die slowly and painfully on broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story ... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss . made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck . but , i will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy . all in all broadway needs something more and fans need something else..
