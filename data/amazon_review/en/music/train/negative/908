very unhappy with this purchase this should probably go to customer service , but your return policy says you ca n't return opened cds so if i ca n't return it , perhaps others can learn from this what can happen when you order online . i thought i was getting the whole cd and when i opened it and put it on , it turned out to have the song not ready to make nice , one other song and then some video of not ready to make nice . i checked with a friend who has the album and she said there should be lots of other songs on it . can you send me the album i thought i was buying
