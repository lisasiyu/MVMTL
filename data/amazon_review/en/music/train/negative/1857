it 's ladies night in danger danger land yep this is pretty much pop metal for twelve year old girls par excellence . this stuff may not require a lot of musical talent but it certainly requires plenty of stylists for hair - perhaps sitting around in stylists chairs does count as 'suffering for your art ' . but honest injun , i only review albums that i actually own and since i 've never ever thrown away a single disc ever bought - well you guessed it - i paid for it and still own it . the airheaded pop stuff here is truly grating . my list of major problems with this release is ; 1 - a band called danger danger puts out an album with the lead track of naughty naughty . the saving grace is that naughty naughty is a darn fine song . really , the genre does n't get much better than this . pity about the rest of this album . 2 - this is the kind of band that metal edge magazine pushed to the fore - one of the most horrid segments of the mag was entitled 'the way the were ' which actually had photos of the band members as kids . really , pandering to the musical tastes of 12 year old girls is not the way forward . then again , at the time d/d made a bit of cash so perhaps they 're the ones laughing now . 3 - `` bang bang - what 's that sound / i gave you my heart then you shot me down '' if naughty naughty was the genre at it 's best then tunes like bang bang were the genre at it 's most dire . i have nothing but good memories of this band - they certainly gave us all a good laugh at the time . despite the fact that in so many ways this only deserves one star , i ca n't possibly do it . these guys bent over backwards to make themselves seem so nice you would n't want to hurt their feelings . not to mention the fact that saturday nite also rocks well . two great songs and a couple of other good hooks just do n't rate so it ca n't get more than two stars
