its wack seriously you dont need me to tell you wack this album is , if you 've ever heard it you 'll know yourself the depths that this album plummets to . i 'll be honest , i heard thug lovin on the radio and thought it was o.k , all the other singles though , mesmerize etc.. were s**t. a friend of mine offered to burn me a copy , free of charge , and i thought fine , what 's the worst that could happen , i was mistaken , i would compare listening to this with torture . if your into sing along pop songs , with a little bad language for good measure , you may like this album . to put this in the hip-hop genre is misleading , ja actually attempts to 'sing ' half the songs on here , and when he 's not singing he does his best tupac impression . thankfully at the time of writing this , his career appears to be over , if we can rid the hip-hop world of nelly and 50 cent as well , the world would be much better for it . avoid any albums by this phoney . message to the honorable , agreed most of the rappers listed are s**t , but ja destroying snoop , eazy-e , mack 10 and dmx , do n't talk s**t , this diva could n't touch any of them . after writing this i noticed someone was selling this album on amazon for 1 cent , that should tell you all you need to know about it
