why is everything geared to helping your kid & quot ; compete & quot ; ? classical music is beautiful and rewarding . ca n't it be rewarding on its own terms , rather than as a & quot ; fast track & quot ; to the ivy league and financial success ? when i was a child , my parents played classical music for us because they loved it , and they hoped we would , too . i do the same for my own kids . but my siblings did n't much like classical music , and despite the insulting and ludicrous claims made on this cd , their sat scores were in line with my own . i think that if beethoven or mozart knew that their beautiful , timeless music was being cheapened into just another & quot ; get ahead quick & quot ; scam , they 'd roll over in their graves
