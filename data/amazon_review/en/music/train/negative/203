yuck , yuck , yuck i am only in my 20 's but i did grow up listening to the original album of a chorus line ( my mom used to play it while we were cleaning ) and i got ta say that this remake is awful . the original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah . i do n't recomend this at all . if you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and i know that you will enjoy it much better
