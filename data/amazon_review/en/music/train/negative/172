sometimes experiments are failures i have always admired the experimental spirit in any artist . as a visual artist i am constantly trying new things in my work and every once in a while i stumble upon some new element or concept that withstands the `` look at it a week from now and see how you feel '' test . other times i churn out pieces of junk which i spare the world from looking at . animal collective should have reconsidered releasing this often silly and pointless collection of sounds . it is an artistic experiment that failed . i hope this is only true about this particular disc ( the only ac i have heard ) as it would be a shame for someone to be consistently putting out pieces of artistic crap for any length of time and still be getting away with it .
