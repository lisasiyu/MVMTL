is this what i expected or not ? an album of outtakes and rarities is an odd thing . obviously , the songs were n't good enough to make the album they were originally intended for . either that or the artist felt they did n't fit right . so how does one go about grading an album of this type ? it 's not easy . graded as a stand-alone album on its own merits , i 'd give this one a single star . marked by inconsistencies and a lack of flow , it 's a poor effort that starts out extremely strong and ends gasping for breath . graded as a complementary album to `` illinois , '' however , i 'd give it three stars . i can understand why the songs were n't used and find several of them worth repeated listening . if i could give half stars , this album would get 1.5 simply because of the overwhelming length . the respective lengths of `` illinois '' and `` michigan '' were n't an issue as the albums both contained an overwhelming amount of good tracks . a compilation like this of rarities and b-sides would have been better served as a 35-40 minute production rather than the 75-minute opus this package is
