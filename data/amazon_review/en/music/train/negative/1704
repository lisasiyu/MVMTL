i really like celine , but what was this ? i was just a little confused when this cd came out a few years ago . i bought it because well ... it 's celine , and i adore her . but ... why did she release this cd besides to make some money during her absence ? i mean ' c'mon ! where 's volume 2 or 3 ? are we going to get them , or are we just stuck with this volume 1 with very random songs on it ? if you 're a celine fan , get this cd to fill out your collection , but if you 're not ... do n't waste your money . if you want a celine album , i would recommend all the way : decade of hits , and one heart
