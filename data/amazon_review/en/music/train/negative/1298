two dog night -- maybe i have to admit , like others , i bought this cd just because i was excited to have another collection of three dog night songs . i was so disappointed when i played it and realized it was really only two dogs . without chuck , there is no three dog night . they can package it the same way , call it by the same name , but it 's not . these vocals are nothing more than lack luster covers of the originals , certainly not the wonderful vocals we have come to know and love . i agree with another reviewer here ... why ca n't they listen to the words of `` easy to be hard '' and patch things up ? if the eagles can do it , the dogs should be able to as well . eager fans are waiting for some new harmony ! oh yeah , and this cd , i threw it away
