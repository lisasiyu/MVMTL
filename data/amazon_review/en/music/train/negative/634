jeff bates leave the light on i never knew a voice could sound that good but his does and i hope that he keeps up the good work.he has a strong voice and should be heard more often on radio.a friend of mine bought one of his cd at one of his concerts and it was the best i have heard in a long time.your music sounds like it is coming from your heart.the one song that really stood out alot to me was mama was alot like jesus.i think that it should be your next release.it 's a very touching ballad and i think people will want to hear more.a new and dedicated fan.gerarda watso
