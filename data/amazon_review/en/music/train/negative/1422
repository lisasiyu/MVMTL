horrible pink floyd is my favorite group of all time and a few hours ago i heard the scissor sisters do a cover of comforably numb on saturday night live . it was the worst song i have ever heard . the scissor sistors are walking on ground they should'nt be walking on . the song was so bad that it took me a minute to figure out they were accually playing comfortably numb . i hope the scissor sisters are happy because they made a mockery of one of the greatest rock songs of all time
