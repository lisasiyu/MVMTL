blue made me blue this album shows sadly that nancy has lost her pipes , albeit ever so slowly . she misses as many as she hits . the arrangements are good and the surrounding cast is excellent with bob mintzer , james moody , tom scott and many others and the artwork is superb ! she looks great in the photos , and maybe that 's good enough reason to buy it . but the singing is poor and her choice of numbers is n't so great either . i suspect that if she would keep it light and moving along at a faster swing-type tempo , as say sinatra did at the end , she would sound better . still a very classy lady though .
