lift him up ! enough said i list hezekiah walker , donnie mcclurckin and micah stampley as gospel vocalist with the most range and you hear how much range he has at the end of lift him up , he is almost singing soprano . this album takes awhile to get used to.there is a mix between live songs and studio songs , different from all of the rest of walkers ' albums.my favorite song is lift him up , and im pretty much satisfied with the album because it lifts me up when i listen to it.i was blessed to see hezekiah walker live and he sung lift him up , ive played in my car ever since and its hard not to shout off of it.i must say i like the live recordings better because i love live instruments .the one thing i must say is that hezekiah walker does not dissapoint and his music is about ministry and not about all the technical stuff that musicians and song writers worry about . hez carries an anointing nobody else carries , he is a pastor first and a singer second , his albums are not about lyrics there about ministry and lifting up jesus.so if you are someone that cares more about lyrics than anointing you might want to try someone else whose anointing is not as powerful as hezekiah walker
