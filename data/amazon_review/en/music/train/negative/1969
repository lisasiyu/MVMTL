what a shame ... this may be a good soundtrack , but what the hell..i 've seen this film a hundred times , and i never frogot that song when he was riding in the helecoptor on the way to vietnam.i couldnt remember the name of the song and forgot who the artist was.so i searched on the crappy internet ... . for over an hour my poor tush hurts , and i found nothing , and it 's a classic song ! ! ! ! ! so i thought to myself my brother might know , so i said to him , remember forrest gump when he was in the helecoptor and the song went `` there must be some way outta here '' and immediately he said jimi hendrix , all along the watchtower ... . shame shame whoever put together this soundtrack needs to be smacked upside the head.. who would forget jimi , and that beautiful classic song . now i know , no wonder i couldnt find it . it aint even on here ! after all those clips i listened to . waste of time , plus what a disappointment to jimi fans .
