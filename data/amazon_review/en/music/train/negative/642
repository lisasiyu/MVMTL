stick with the original soundtracks like other uses have pointed out , the music are not conducted by john williams nor performed by the london symphony orchestra , and they do not sound the same with the music from the movies . you are still getting a nice collection of music , but for the real john willims music , you got ta buy the original soundtracks . these products just do n't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by john williams
