life is hard , and then you die as the fantastic song title above indicates , life is hard , and it 's been hard on johnny winter . it is definitely beginning to show . i play guitar and sing , too , and an arrhythmic heart keeps me off stage a lot . what a drag . well , i hear johnny has a few health issues , and i only mentioned my own in order to be able to say that he sounds on this album a little like i feel , sometimes . his voice has weakened quite a bit , and thinned out , but as with the change in bob dylan 's voice , he actually sounds more musical , sweeter , now , than before . so the burning glory is gone , and the blistering solos are replaced with very carefully phrased and finished riffs . and , yes , a little lacking in energy at some points . the monkey song is almost too skanky to be believed . hell , johnny , they 're all shaved on the internet these days anyway , and that 's probably as far as some lame old guy like you gets , right ? sorry . this guy , doing rock & roll hootchie-koo with rick derringer back in 1970 , could blow walls down . i guess this is the blues
