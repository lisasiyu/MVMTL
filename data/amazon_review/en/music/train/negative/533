i 've got some issues with this cd first of all , jump is too good of a track . i still have n't heard the rest of this cd because i just put jump on repeat and rap at the top of my lungs on my 45 minute commute . it ends up being about 10 times each way to work and if i 'm at a long light , i look a little nuts for rapping to the song twice , but like i 've always told people , if yelling a rap song by 12 year olds at the top of your lungs is wrong , i do n't want to be in prison . the other problem i have with this thing is that if you try to be like kriss cross , you ca n't hold a job . if you are a true kriss krosser , you braid your hair and wear your clothes backwards . i got a job with a bank when i graduated from the u of phoenix and i showed up on my first day with my suit on backwards . i started getting a bunch of customer complaints and they would call my manager , mr. gingercrap , up to tell me they had a problem with my attire . little did they know that i wired the intercom system to play jump by the rap kings . i just pushed play and got on the drive thru teller mic and busted a groove in my reverse suit . i got fired . well , after getting fired six other times from places like burger king , jiffy lube , ted pants shack , jorks and microsubs i decided to be a roller rink cop . i make kids leave the floor if they skate too fast . if they resist my orders , i have a tazer that i use without hesitation . i usually whisper for them to leave the rink so they say they ca n't hear me . stop ! tazer time ! ! they do n't care how i dress and pay me like 5 buks an hour . yup , i 'm at another level
