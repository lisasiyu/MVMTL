mostly good material , but little value added . `` the day the world went away '' was the leadoff single from `` the fragile '' and is of minimal value to all but collectors . two of the tracks on this are taken straight from `` the fragile '' ( with small adjustments , one 's slightly shorter , one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in ) , with the third ( a remix ) also being available on part two of the `` we 're in this together '' singles . but looking at the songs themselves -- `` the day the world went away '' is fantastic -- bleak , moody , with a great loud-soft interplay , a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from reznor , and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end . the quiet mix is worthwhile , with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano , in many ways it works better than the album mix , but its a bit overlong . i 'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better , the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece . `` starf***ers , inc '' is a rather popular song amongst fans , but i 've always found it to be a bit dull -- the verses are nice enough , with a great beat , and there 's some interesting guitar work on the piece , but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing . material aside , unless you 're a completionist , you can skip this one
