disappointed longtime fan some of us have been through years where the beastie boys were always playing in at least one of the tape decks in our dual tape players ( that 's cassette tapes , in case you are too young to know ) . anyway , i was hoping for another album that would stay ( now in my 5-disc changer ) for at least a full year without my having to swap it out . unfortunately , this is not what i got in this album . while there are tracks on this album that capture the energy and passion of the beastie boys of old , too much of this record feels like preaching . although i agree with much of what they have to say , they now do so in such a politically over-hyped fashion that it detracts from their music . truly , there are some great songs on this record . but if you listen to this album and then to paul 's boutique , licensed to ill or another great one , you will quickly realize that this is not the beastie boys who revolutionized music in the late 20th century
