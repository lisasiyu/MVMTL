just plain boring i 've tried to make it through the album twice and i 'm bored to tears with these songs . maybe it will sound better on a cold rainy day . i so wanted to enjoy this album , but ca n't seem to get into the versions of these songs . i would n't recommend this to anyone but a die-hard fan .
