that 's it ? i had heard a lot about my chemical romance , both positive and negative . i decided to pick up a used copy of 'three cheers for sweet revenge ' so i could form my own opinion without the biased input of from jaded indie hipster snobs or 14 year-old spoiled scene kids . this record was written and marketed to deliver pop songs , and the opener 'helena ' is an outstanding one . it has a great melody that stands up to repeated listening , and the performance is passionate and convincing . the problem is that on every other song on the album , i was bored with the melodies and performances , even after extensive repeated listening [ i 'm talking about keeping this in my cd player for over 2 months , not just a quick skip-through ] . the high-gloss production values suffocate any negligable amount of rocking power and sonic depth that the music might have had , and the juvenile melodrama of the lyrics and melodies gets old real fast when they do n't deliver the pop hooks they promise . this album does not rock . period
