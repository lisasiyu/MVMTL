sorry ... i do n't like it ... personally , i like the other albums from staind . i love `` dysfunction '' , i like `` break the cycle '' , `` 14 shades ... '' was tolerable , and i really enjoyed `` chapter v '' . however , even for a debut , `` tormented '' just sounds inmmature . there 's emotion , but i lost count on the how many times the `` f-word '' is not only mentioned on the album , but on each song alone . then again , fred durst produced this band in the first place , so that probably had a lot to do with it . all in all , the album itself just flat out sucks
