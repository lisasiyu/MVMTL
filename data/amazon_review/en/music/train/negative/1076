amazon did a very poor job in advertising this product i know that this cd set is great , that is why i ordered it . i however got an e-mail after i had already ordered the item that i found on the website saying they refunded my money because the price was wrong and the `` quality of the item was n't good . '' what sort of bad advertising is that ? it is n't my fault that they priced it wrong , and if there was a mistake i should have received it anyway . it is n't fair , and i want everyone to know that they obviously did not do their jobs in making sure all of the information was correct to be displayed on the website .
