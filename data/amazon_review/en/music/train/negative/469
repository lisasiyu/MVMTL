one singular sensation ? yes , but only the original cast album it was , and remains , one singular sensation . a chorus line changed the face of american musical theater , with an urbane book by nick dante and james kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by ed kleban and marvin hamlisch . the pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in broadway and on cd . . . and we ca n't wonder why . those familiar with the original cast recording will cringe at the flatness of the `` new '' recording , a recording that 's simultaneously intrusive on the memory and superfluous in any collection . is this what baayork lee did for love
