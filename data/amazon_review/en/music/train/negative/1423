two great songs , four lame ones i ca n't believe the 5 star reviews this album gets . ( well , it probably deserves it more than yoko ono and syd barrett 's albums , which also get mostly 5 stars . ) `` golden years '' is an excellent track , one of bowie 's best ( wa-wa-wa ) .. the title track is pretty catchy too . but the rest of it is just depressing , dull songs with little of the originality that marked his hunky dory/ ziggy / aladdin sane era . he just ran out of ideas i guess . i can believe he does n't remember making this album - he sounds detached and bored with it all . i 've never considered david bowie a great vocalist , it 's a testament to the quality of his ziggy-era songs that you do n't notice his vocals are a bit thin and weak , and need lots of echo and studio effects to thicken them up . and the songs on this album are more vehicles for an accomplished vocalist than a simple singer-songwriter . i 'll give him credit for improving his voice and learning good singing techniques - the vocals here are certainly more accomplished than those on his earlier albums . but it 's not enough to save this lot of songs . i guess it all depends on what matters more to you , the quality of the song itself , or the vocalist 's ability . if you like the first , get ziggy stardust . if the latter matters more , get this album .
