where are the original ? harry connick , jr. did a fair job representing the musical legends that were found in the movie , but nonetheless , this soundtrack should contain the artists who created the songs and/or who were featured in the motion picture . if you are purchasing this cd because you enjoy the classics performed by musical legends , as i do , then i do not recommend this cd ; instead i would buy the originals
