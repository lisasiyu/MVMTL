more than the 2 hits ... i love the foundations who made a lot of great music in the sixties . of course everyone has heard `` baby now that i 've found you '' and `` build me up buttercup '' , but they had so many great songs . i had a ten inch compilation from the early'80 's with about ten songs , all of which are on this disc . they would 've fit in very well with a lot of the motown groups , although they were a multi-racial english band . i mistakenly gave this recording one star when i intended five .
