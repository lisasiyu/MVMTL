what lousy packaging ! i really enjoyed bear family 's robert mitchum two-fer & quot ; that man & quot ; and immediately bought this disc when i saw it . first of all , the content is lighter weight than his other albums . these tracks from his early filmwork are great for the mitchum fan but someone wanting to actually investigate the man 's singing ability should be directed to & quot ; that man & quot ; or & quot ; calypso is like so & quot ; . my complaint ( and the reason i did n't give it a higher rating ) is the packaging . i thought it was beautiful when i first opened it . a shiny gatefold cardboard package with a clear disc tray and a gorgeous book full of movie posters and a complete filmography with lots of great info . then the tray fell off of the cardboard backing . then , the pages started falling out of the book ! the whole thing literally fell apart on me ! for a pricey import disc such as this , it 's totally unacceptable . maybe i just got a defective one , but i 'm not willing to plunk down another 22 bucks to find out . if you feel you must buy this disc , a word of caution : handle with care
