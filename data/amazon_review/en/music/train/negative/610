worth every penny after listlening to this cd a couple of times and watching dr. know play with brandon cruz i think that this cd is worth every penny.if you call yourself a dr. know fan and dont own this cd then you should slap youself right now.it doesnt matter if its not kyle toucher its still dr. know and they kick ass and brandon cruz is a cool guy.also the metal stuff that kyle did kicks ass too , if you are a fan then you should check that out too
