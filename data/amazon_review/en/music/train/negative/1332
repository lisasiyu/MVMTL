save your money i am so dissapointed in this cd . i bought it because i have `` blow by blow '' and `` jeff beck with the jan hammer group '' and i love those cds . this crap sounds like somebody that heard those recordings , practiced for one week and tried to do an imitation of them . i do n't like one cut on the entire cd . i only gave it one star because i could n't find a way to give it less .
