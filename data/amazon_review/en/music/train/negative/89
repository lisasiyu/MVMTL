this is it , michael jackson is officially more punk than warped tour wow ... i look at this track listing and it makes me cringe ... .i mean i know that warped lost its punk credibility back in 2003 , but this is just overkill ... .relient k , academy is , everytime i die , from first to last , underoath , matchbook romance , saves the day are reasons not to support this tour ( for all those people who go just to see nofx , casualties , and time again ) ... i really give bad religion and rancid props for not being on here this time around ! this is worse than last year 's by far ... .but what could you expect ? these tours over the past 3 years have been on a downfall ... i mean the bands that are good on this are n't really worth the agony and disgust to want to purchase this and/or purchase a 40 $ ticket to one of the shows . to me , that is a scam ... im so glad that people stopped referring to warped tour as a `` punk '' tour ... i mean maybe if nofx gets a hefty amount of boos from those trendy scenester hot topic kids , then maybe even those guys can see what hell this `` nu-emo '' trend is . now , i am not going to go off on some explosion about what real punk is , but i will say this ... .fans of warped 2003 and back ... steer clear..this is merely a compilation of green day-esque bands ( minus time again and casualties..and maybe 3-5 other decnet bands ) ... .some are turned up a few thousand jolts and some are slowed down a little bit , but i bet any of them will admit that bille joe ( brainless ) armstrong is a deep inspiring figure . all we are really missing here to make this the ultimae pile of crap is fallout boy , simple plan , yellowcard , blink 182 , good charlotte and new-school afi . bottom line ... avoid like the plague and maybe it will change next year for the better ! ... ... most likely it 'll be worse , but hey , stranger things have happened
