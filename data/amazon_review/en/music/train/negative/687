disappointment ok , i guess after 30+ years of generally spectacular music diamonds , everyone is entitled to plunk down a lump of coal . that 's just what this cd is..a dull clunky lump of coal . i 've been listening to bonnie for most of those 30+ years . i still have streetlights and home plate on vinyl . for the past many years , i did n't even listen to her new music before purchasing . i just bought em ! there were always bound to be a couple `` popular '' hits and more than a couple undiscovered diamonds on in the tracks . not so for this cd . i will not be broken is acceptable ... the rest of the tracks sound almost off key and in some places , even out of tune with herself . bonnie is still one of my all time favorite singers - but i wish i would have saved my $ $ and not blindly purchased this one .
