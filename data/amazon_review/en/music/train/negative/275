boringest band ever i have seen these guys twice , once opening for six feet under , and the other for strapping young lad . and god almighty both times i wanted to bash my head in concrete to keep from hearing these guys . overall these guys suck even the heavy parts and the melodic parts will put you to sleep . stop trying to be unearth and opeth and make good music like they do..
