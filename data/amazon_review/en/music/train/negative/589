if you want gnr 's greatest hits or best of then just pick up appetite for destruction afd was one of the greatest rock albums ever made . i wanted to hate the album so much . i was an alternative/avant guard snob when afd was released . to me , these clowns were just another hairspray band . but i took a long car trip with some chick i was banging and her roommate . the roommate played the tape at least three times on the trip . by the end , i was hooked . that 's the mark of truly great art . if it can draw in someone who 's predisposed to hate it , its got something special . i looked forward to the next album , g n ' r lies . but when it came out , i was disappointed . it was ok , but hardly the cultural epoch that was afd . nice boys was kind of fun . used to love her was a humorous novelty song . mama kin was a decent cover , but no real improvement over the original . the rest of the disk was just crap . but what the hell , its was just an ep right ? something to tide us over until the next brutal masterpiece . then came gnr 's death knell , the two use your illusions . over-produced , bloated , boring and pretentious . everything i had always hated hair-metal for in the first place . gone was the sound of the alley ways of sunset boulevard , replaced by the sound of computers , maids and beverley hills hookers n blow parties . rock n roll sung by a guy in custom-ripped jeans who just came out of a session with his hair stylist and manicurist . nothing to see here . move along . so , if you want to see the genius and promise of gnr , just pick up appetite for destruction , and pretend they just broke up after creating one of the greatest albums of all time
