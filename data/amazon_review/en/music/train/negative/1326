this album blows the vocals are hella cool but the lyrics are g.ay , and i the layering could have been better . i kinda like this band but i think this album could have been alot more then it was . oh well what do i know , i am not doing what their doing , im siting on a computer crying about it , oh well whatever their lucky but i still hate this album , but its still semi ok but just not for me , it make me yaw
