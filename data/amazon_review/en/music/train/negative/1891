dreadful senesino first of all , decca engineers insist on to differentiate `` their '' scholl 's voice from that more sweet , resounding previous harmonia mundi cd 's like bach cantatas solo , english folksongs and so on where it was a pleasure to hear this singer.even orchestra bizantina could be better recorded ; maybe milano auditorium has n't fine acoustics.however , the same happens on `` heroes '' and `` banquett '' .in this senesino combo just here , scholl 's voice sounds rough and unpleasant , the top of his range excessive and satured.second of all , in my opinion , opera is n't his confort zone for good.i believe that as a chorister boy , he grew up in that german musical territory singing sacred music by buxtehude , bach , where he did his best on recording.in this cd , i heard his worse ; a rugged vocalization plentiful in ha-ha-ha , absolutely abusive that seems dreadful to me ( `` al lampo dell'armi '' for instance ) , his vocal colours sounding like croacks sometimes , incongruous and dramatically unfruitful attempt to perform repertoire previously recorded by himself like it was a new , fresh one ( `` dove sei '' , '' aure , deh , ... '' ) .i 'm sorry ; i know scholl fans are very zealous on their idol but i have heard much better senesinos by derek lee ragin , daniels , minter , gall and so on .
