scrap it do n't buy this album . you would have to have pretty drab music taste to like this generic , emotionless , tired , garbage . merkin dream is clearly ripping off any worthwhile downtempo group that they find fitting ( ie . massive attack , air , everything but the girl ) , plus there is no vocal talent in the 3 songs they actually sing in . someone thought track 7 was funny or cute because a robotic voice says , `` does my hard drive turn you on ? '' what is wrong with you people ? if you want decent robo-pop music , try kraftwerk , figurine , or even ladytron . my advice to merkin dream is to stop making music because you 're brainwashing poor children out there into thinking you 're something good
