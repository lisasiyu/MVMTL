a disappointing and naive take on house or electronic music i had read the reviews of this album and picked it up on the strength of the positive comments , but i was shocked at how terrible this album was . understanding herbert 's classical piano background , i expected a deep and nuanced interpretation of house that could combine interesting danceable beats with a solid 4x4 backbone , but some rhythmic variation and interesting found sounds from the claims of so many odd samples used . the first thing that put me off was the terrible vocals , which combine the cheesy and trite lyrical stylings of the worst diva-house with the shallow wording of your local folk music open mic . the rhythms were also boring , none of the more interesting layering ontop of the standard house beat , but a very shallow and superficial interpretation you would expect to find on a casio keyboard . stay away
