not as good as it shoulda , coulda been ... i know that it takes talent to make music , and i hate to criticize any musicians because i certainly could n't do it , but this cd was just not that good . there are some cool beats , but they 're pretty forgettable . lyrics in electronic music are n't always deep or anything , but in some cases , i think she actually was trying to make a & quot ; real song & quot ; , so it was kind of sad . her vocals are madonna-esque , without the smooth production . maybe she just did n't quite live up to the hype . i 'm beginning to think that most female djs & quot ; make it & quot ; just because of the novelty of female djs . there was nothing to hate , but there certainly was n't anything to love , either
