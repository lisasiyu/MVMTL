no more vocals please ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i purchased the winter solstice vol # 3 thinking that it would be as good as the rest , was i disappointed . tracks 5,6,7,10,11.13 are atrocious , the rest of the tracks are good.i cant get to my cd player fast enough to skip over them when they start playing.i now sample every song on the cds and dont take for granted that all winter solstices are created equal.people , please start giving honest reviews and stop the false advertisement
