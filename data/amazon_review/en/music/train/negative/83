boring ... .zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz i purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from jmm . however , this album really lacks when it comes to good material . there really is n't one song that stands out , nothing worth playing over and over . the entire album is pretty much `` blowing flowers out of your [ rear end ] '' types of songs . the title cut , `` pictures '' is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more . it sounds like something an 8 year old wrote . rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd , get a pat green or brad paisley cd , they are much more worth your money
