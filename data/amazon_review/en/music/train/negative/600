a little catchy , pretty disappointing it 's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way . i ca n't play a few of the songs with my kids around . while the inappropriate songs may be catchy , it 's disappointing that they had to be so `` give it to me '' . it 's also missing the `` rap/yodeling/soul '' stuff that made me like her so much in the first album
