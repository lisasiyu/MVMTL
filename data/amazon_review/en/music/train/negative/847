what are these official reviewers thinking ? this not a terrible album , but it is not that good either , and this , when coupled with the fact that there are many other bands doing very similar things much better than knapsack , means that it probably is n't worth the investment . i have never heard any of their other albums , but this one had neither wonderful guitar work nor intriguing vocals , and the lyrics ( which have been called brilliant by one of the official reviewers ) leave something to be desired . the first time you hear this album , you will probably like it , but after three or four more times all the way through , i think you will probably be either skipping half the songs , taking the album out after three songs , or running to your local used cd store to get some of your poorly invested money back . it just does n't have that lasting quality that a great album has ; this album does not leave you wanting more , as a brilliant album would do . in short , not a terrible album but not worth paying full price for , especially when there are so many bands out their which are doing the whole emo-punk-pop thing much better
