avoid i bought this cd for one reason only- kyu sakamoto 's `` sukiyaki '' . unfortunately , this 1994 compilation cd has a tremendous amount of hiss which makes for an annoying and disappointing listening experience . you will be much happier buying one of kyu 's newer cds with better noise reduction technology , and as an added bonus , you will also be rewarded with his other material which you will not get with this bad cd .
