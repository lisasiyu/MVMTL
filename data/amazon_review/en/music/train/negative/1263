no ? so i really liked new nathan detroits ... i kept listening , hoping for more . what i got was a listless drone of alternative sounding chords and alkaline trio style vocals . i suppose i didnt give the album much of a chance ... but when i have to stop listening to it twice because it bores me so much , i dont feel like i need to . the album appeared to have potential ... but nothing stuck out except for the first track . everything just ran together , and it was difficult to seperate any sort of melody in any of the songs . compared to all the other reviews , i am apparently missing something , but i didnt like it . i heard it directly after listening to appleseed casts ' & quot ; end of the ring wars & quot ; , which was amazing . so i guess would recomend that over this anyday . i will give this album another chance , simply because everyone else seems to like it so much , but as for right now , it gets a big juicy thumbs down
