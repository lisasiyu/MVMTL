wow ! ! ! ! ! ! be does n't live up to the hype ? whoever wrote that editorial needs to be punished . the court jester does n't deserve to live . not only does be live up to the hype ; be is the hype . common and kanye reminiscent of quincy and michael , the early years . when michael was still black and male . simply stated , be flows . if be were any tighter we could n't afford it . no need to skip or go back . just enuff songs to make you listen to it again . great work of art . common and kanye - damn ! ! ! !
