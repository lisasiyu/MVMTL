i 'm sad to say ... .but i am dissapointed i know that this review will be followed by several saying that i am stupid and am not aware of how awesome shadows fall is , but i still think it is worthwhile to let other people know my opinion . i was excited for this album , shadows fall shows so much potential at times but this release is such a disappointment . while it is n't terrible , it just is not good . it suffers the pitfall of many metal releases , all the songs follow identical formats and never keep your interest . if you do n't believe me , scan through this cd and let me know if almost all ( with the exception of one or two ) are n't : a kind of cool guitar intro that might lead to something cool , then drums come in with the same predictable snare on every beat , and then mediocre vocals singing some of the most lackluster vocal in recent memory . do n't buy this album looking for some sort of blistering heavy metal experience . do n't buy this album if you want something you may replay again . if you want to buy a mediocre heavy metal album then i guess you should buy this album , but i say take a stand . do n't just buy whatever shadows fall puts out in front of you . the war within was a good cd . the follow up bonus track cd was just a desperate attempt to make more money with nothing new and this cd is just a group that did n't really try and put out some music . i 'm sorry to all the die hard shadows fall fans , and you may enjoy this album which is great for you , but i really felt like shadows fall underachieved and did n't really put enough into this release . i know they could have done better
