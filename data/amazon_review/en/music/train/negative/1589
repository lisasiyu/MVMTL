aah you know this guy did appeal to me at first , but if you have this cd youve heard american bad ass , right ? listen to metallicas & quot ; sad but true & quot ; . he ripped off the guitar part completely . h e tries to be metal , hardcore rap , and country at the same time . fails miserably . he is a talentless wigger . wait ... thats too nice . i hope he commits suicide
