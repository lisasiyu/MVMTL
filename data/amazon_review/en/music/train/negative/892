try ultra dance 2 , it 's much better . i bought this cd based on the fact that i liked ultra dance 2 . i thought the third one would be another good cd to listen to for the summer . i was disappointed when i got my cds and listened to them . the mixes on these songs are terrible , with the exception of two tracks . on the other hand , ultra dance 2 , which is mixed by dj encore , is much better in comparison . although the songs on ultra dance 2 are last year songs , it is worth more than this one . trust me , you are not missing anything
