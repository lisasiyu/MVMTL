sorry renee i did not like this album one bit , or one song . i had a hard time listening to it all the way through . i certainly would never listen to it a second time . affected and pretentious . miss fleming has a beautiful voice , but not here . the songs that were not ugly to begin with , ended up that way . so far i have `` standard '' albums from kiri , dawn , and now renee , please ladies let 's have no more of this , it does n't work .
