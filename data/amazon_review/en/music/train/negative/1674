poor beyond poor beyond poor beyond poor beyond poor ... i remember christmas a couple years back , when i saw a cd wrapped under the tree . hoping it would either be by the beatles or a computer game , i eagerly unwrapped it . i thought , oh no not pop music , but gave it a chance anyway . i 'm sorry i did . the first three songs are all raps , and you know my feelings toward rap ( if you do n't , i hate it . ) hot in herre is on my list of overrated songs , although weird al 's parody , trash , is hilarious . a bunch of boring songs , then landslide , which is okay ... more boring songs ... no doubt ? dear god , do n't let them hurt me ! more boring songs ... hey , hero , that 's good , do n't know why is too . more boring songs ... in my place , that one 's good ... more boring songs ... one last breath ? make it stop ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do n't buy this .
