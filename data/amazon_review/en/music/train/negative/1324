gag . i despise this . there is absoluetly no point of listening to this , for you are missing out on all of jonathan larsons creation- and it is n't fair to the listener or the creator . i woudl n't waste my money on this . if anything , give it as a present , or as sort of an introduction to rent , but bits and pieces of the magic just is wrong . even if it claims to be `` the best of rent '' - i disagree , the best of rent is jonathan larsons creation in its entirety
