very disappointed watched the movie on dvd , loved it so much i immediately got on-line and bought the soundtrack . one of the things i liked about the movie is the juxtaposition of ballroom music and hiphop . the soundtrack for this movie about ballroom dancing does not have a single track of the ballroom music on it ! what 's up with that ?
