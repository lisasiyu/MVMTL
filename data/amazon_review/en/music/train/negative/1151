for completists and historians only i just got this at a bargain price from amazon.co.uk . its great for completists and meek collectors , and even for those who want to know about girl singers or production methods of the 1960s . but it 's not very listenable . there are about four really good tracks on it , and no stars with the possible exception of glenda collins
