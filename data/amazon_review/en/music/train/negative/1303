cetacean is the only decent track i like what phil rogers said about cetacean . but to me , cetacean does n't sound surfadelic so much as cheezadelic . as a matter of fact , it 's arguably the apotheosis of mod-a-go-go cheezpop . susan does n't impress me . i do n't hear what nicjaytee hears in it . cj & the fish also did a few tracks for a soundtrack called zacariah . and zacariah is n't included at amazon . so allow me to say something about it here . ya know all of those song lyrics wherein the singer brags about the modesty of his needs ? well , let it be known that barry melton wrote a parody of that obnoxious mentality in a tune called all i need : `` all i need to have a good time is a reefer , a woman , and a bottle of wine . with those 3 things i do n't need no sunshine . a reefer , a woman , and a bottle of wine . all i want is to never grow old . i want to wash in a bathtub of gold . i want 97 kilos already rolled . i want to wash in a bathtub of gold . i wan na light my cigars with 10-dollars bills . i 'd like to have a cattle ranch in beverly hills . i 'd like a bottle of red-eye that 's always filled . i 'd like to have a cattle ranch in beverly hills .
