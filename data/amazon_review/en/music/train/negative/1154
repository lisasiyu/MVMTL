the phantom of the opera ( original 1986 london cast ) the music in this cd is beautiful , the lyrics are lovely as well . the fact that i do n't like michael crawfords ' voice might have something to do with this ... gerard butler was the first phantom i heard ... . so i hold my standards to him . michael crawfords ' voice is nice , i 'll admit , but give me gerry any day . perhaps michael did have a voice suited for the role , and perhaps gerard butler did n't , but i 'm partial to emotional songs to wooden-flat ones , and baritone voices to tenor voices . sarah has a lovely voice , but in my opinion , it is a bit too mature for the part of a 16 year old girl . but do n't let this stop you-buy this cd ... you may love it , you may hate it . just compare michael 's voice to gerard 's voice ... the difference is rather laughable
