very disappointed ... this reissue could have been so much more . firstly , the versions of several of these songs are markedly different from the original album , especially `` i 've tried everything . '' if they wanted to remix these songs , they should have just used them as bonus tracks ! and the original album artwork is not here ( the back shot of david stewart is missing ) , as are the lyrics . and finally ... these bonus tracks suck ! ! ! they should have definately included the dance mix of 17 again , which , here in the u.s. , was the only hit version of that song ! ! ! what a drag .
