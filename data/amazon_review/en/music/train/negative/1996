really dissapointing his previous album `` you 've come along way baby '' was so good and original but now it seems like he 's spending more time on his music videos then on the music , many songs on this cd are also based on samples from older songs like `` star 69 '' and `` weapon of choice '' and `` sunset '' some say he 's matured as a artist but when something worked pretty good why do n't continue in that way instead of making the oddest songs he could think of . norman cook is a dance artist and there 's no way he should try to do something he is n't used to . bootsy collins `` weapons of choise '' and macy gray `` love life '' is cd , so does the voice of jim morrison on `` sunset '' but they can not save this album from fiasco , to me it feels like the guest attists take too much place , it 's no longer so much of the original fat boy slim sound here . `` yo mama '' got a cool sound though , but he could have tried to do something more with that song . `` song for shelter '' is dark and slow aswell , think he even released it on single . let 's just wait for a better time , this album was really a flop
