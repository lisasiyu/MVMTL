ho hum keller williams is a fine fine acoustic guitar player . i ca n't deny him that . however , after seeing him live , i ca n't say i will ever see him again . too much looping , too much cheese and not enough grit . light and fluffy . maybe you could call it bubble gum music . i 'm not turned off to the jamband scene . that 's not it at all . i was a phish fan for many years ... going back to the late eighties . i really enjoy improvisation . my musical life revolves around it , whether i 'm playing or listening , whether its jazz , free or jamming . i love it all . i just find keller williams and a lot of the bands ( not that he 's a band really ) that are in the `` jam '' scene to be pretty boring . at least keller does n't go on twenty minute quasi-bluegrass noodle jams
