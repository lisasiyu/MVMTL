poorly produced this cd just doesnt sound good which means it was poorly produced . any 1999 cd should have better sound quality . like the other reviewers stated , i too found it dissapointing that the wrestlers theme songs were approximately 1 minute long each. got ta hit the repeat button to enjoy them a little longer . they could have been longer and the cd could have done without the irrelevant remarks made here and there by the commentators . curiously too , where is the nwo 's music
