poseur kid `` rock '' is to rock-and-roll what twinkies are to gourmet cooking . he 's a poseur and a pretender , who tries to mimick the attitude and style of those who went before him -- bob seeger , rolling stones -- while hoping that no one will notice that he has none of their talent . why listen to a pale imitation when the music of the true greats is still available ?
