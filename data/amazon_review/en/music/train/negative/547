one of the reasons i hate radio ... nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers i have ever heard . i do give him props on his first album , but he went downhill and started that whole `` i can make great club beats , but write bubblegum lyrics over it '' trend . this sadly created all the chingys , lil johns and so on . the guy does n't add any substance to his music , yet he sells millions thanks to mtv . just save your money on real artist that makes real music
