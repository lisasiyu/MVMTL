if you actually want to listen to punk ... ... do n't buy this cd . most of this is emo , and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy . there are a few good bands on this cd -- enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice , but it 's not worth your time if you 're an actual punk fan . it has an interesting mix of music , but it does n't fit together too well . the upsides to this compilation are as follows : one , the dropkick murphys song , and two , it 's inexpensive . however , it 's even less expensive to just forget about buying this cd at all
