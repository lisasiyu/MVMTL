her singing is gorgeous , but . . . maire brennan 's singing and artistry is breathtakingly beautiful , and for most this can be rated a fabulous album . you need to understand , however , that this is a decidedly , in your face , unavoidably christian album . for those , like me , who are recovering from christianity , it was an unpleasant surprise , but not one for which i will fault or judge maire brennan . i just wish i had realized it before i had bought the album . it would be better listed or sold under christian music than under any other category
