a few high points but mostly dull aphrodite must have been preoccupied when he mixed this one . for the most part the tracks drag on with no end in sight or build toward some invisible ( and unmelodic ) climax . there are a few with powerful beats and creative touches such as tracks 14 featuring jungle brothers and 13 featuring n.w.a . but for the most part the rappers take center stage and aphrodite does n't add much . if you really want to sample his talent buy his self titled cd
