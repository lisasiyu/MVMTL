this may have been their breakthrough on the charts but ... .. it sucks big time ! ! ! ! ! ! ! alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in hell ... i mean florida . the first song i heard from this was `` today '' , and i thought it was good the first time i heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that i heard , but then when i heard the entire song it was depressing , and then there was `` disarm '' which i hated from day one , and the same with `` cherub rock '' . i just felt like i should n't have even bought this at this particular time in my life , but i guess i was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt . however , with one song barely tolerable which is `` mayonaise '' i 'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90 's
