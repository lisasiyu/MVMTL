murdering the dead horse `` a collection of short stories will go down as one of the best debut albums of any band . '' that , i 'm afraid , is a real review ... someone actually listened to this and decided that it is so good that it deserves to be ranked among the greatest debuts ever weezer - the blue album led zepplin - self titled creedence clearwater revival the cure the pixies queen red hot chili peppers sublime the violent femmes death cab for cutie houston calls ... .one of these bands are not like the others , one of these bands just dont belong.. truth is , i heard this cd before i even listened to it . this style is hackneyed and killed . it 's been so long since a genuinely good band has been seen as cool that even the critics are starting to forget what good music sounds like . `` 200 miles that sure is far '' ... thats a real line on this cd . but whatever , this is what amazing is these days..this is where generations of integrity has brought us in music..its a lost cause because in the end i guess it really is all about the dollar . the music industry is one of the most unstable industries out there . no one knows how they are going to look financially in the next ten years..so what do they do ? they take the quick cash in..they sign crap like this that no one has to think about . easy music , easy dollar . building a band is too much of a risk these days..now instead of building them and improving them , they produce them..autotuner , cut and paste music ... so sure this is a great cd and everyone needs to check it out because we all need to chip in on drive thru/rushmore 's new escalade with chrome hydrolics..at least the rap industry is honest about where the money goes
