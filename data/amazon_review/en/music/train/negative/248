low point for springsteen i 'm not the biggest fan of springsteen , but i have liked a lot of what he 's done in the past . i wasted my money on this one . it sounds like uninspired mumbling . not much musical or vocal variation at all among the songs . nothing stands out . no experimentation . there might be some good story lines in the songs , but i usually ca n't understand him anyway . i liked two songs , but not enough to get the album out and turn it on . i never desire to play it after a few listenings . so beware , unless your a huge fan and want all his music , this one may let you down .
