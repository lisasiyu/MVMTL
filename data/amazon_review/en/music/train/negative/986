hate to admit it hate to admit it but this just is n't very good . been a fan since 'slowhand ' so i 've been frequently disappointed and underwhelmed by clapton , but this is just amazing . this has everything going for it but it just does n't come together . the featured review by 'woomer ' mirrors my feelings that nothing since 'from the cradle ' has been worthwhile barring 'riding with the king ' and that was helped immensely by king himself . toss this onto the heap along with 'reptile ' and 'pilgrim '
