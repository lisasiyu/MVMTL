a young sheryl crow ? i bought this album because i liked her version of underdog victorious on mountain stage in winter 2005 . i was disappointed with the version of underdog victorious on this album . her singing on the mountain stage show seemed more energetic and heartfelt whereas this album version seemed flat in comparison . the album in general just sounds like a really young sheryl crow
