this album blows arse cheeks i 'm a huge fan of the beatles . i 'm also a huge fan of the modern artists that did this album . ..and the backbeat movie was ok too . so i figure , how can i go wrong . i 'll buy the record . well simply put , the album sounds like a bunch of generic poo . why in the world did they have thurston moore on here ? hmm , we need somebody to stand there and strum basic chords .. let 's bring in someone who normally plays sound-effects guitar with magnets and drumsticks . obviously the point was to put together a modern supergroup ( underground supergroup anyway ) to cover a supergroup . problem = it does n't sound like the beatles or like these familiar modern artists . it just falls somewhere boringly inbetween , though that might be exactly what some people would want . dave grohl can not sing . yeah that 's right i said it . gumby was a better rockstar then this guy . ..well i mean that sarcastically but thinking about it , gumby was actually a really cool rockstar . but back on topic , dave grohl needs to stick to things he 's good at like chewing gum , beating the snot out of drum-sets , and growing big sweaty moustaches . i 've heard cardboard boxes blowing in the wind that sounded more exciting then this record . if amazon.com had the feature , i 'd give it a negative star just for having the guy from soul asylum on it .
