ladies and gents ... . it does n't get any worse than this . if you have any doubts as to whether def jazz is `` worth '' the trouble -- do n't bother . to even call this repulsive mess jazz is a slap in the face to a genre that has stood fine on it 's own without the help of so called fusion rap/jazz albums . to the reviewer who named this the best jazz album ever : shame on you ! ! ! ! ! !
