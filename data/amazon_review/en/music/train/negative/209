damn , another underdone turd , send it back ! i was just speechless when i first heard this . what was known as the best heavy metal band on earth 10 years prior , has become a lion without balls or teeth . country-influenced tunes ! ? slow , blues-influenced songs ? no way , no thanks . also a very overrated album . the black album was okay but 3 stars in my book..but man this was a sharp right turn for them and the beginning of the end for metallica.ps : the memory remains and unforgiven 2 are horrible songs .
