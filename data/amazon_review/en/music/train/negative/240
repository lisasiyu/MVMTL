i 'm a fan ... but this cd is not good . luckily , i only paid 5 bucks for the used copy . i mean do we really want to hear incomplete songs ? i do n't . the couple of actual completed songs are pretty good so it gets 2 stars as opposed to the one star it probably deserves . bruce really took a page from gene 's book here and went after the money . should be an ep and nothing more
