i thought he was a changed man . this must be the record for quickest backslide i 've ever seen . he went from u saved me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old . this all shows he was n't sincere about his spirituality . all the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal . i admit i was intrigued and entertained with trapped in the closet ; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous . to continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to chapter 100 ( which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it ) is unacceptable
