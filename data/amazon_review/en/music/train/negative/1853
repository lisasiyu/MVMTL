war and peace as a fan of buth and his song contributions to the flatlanders , i was disappointed to find many of the songs to be unsubtle , strident polemics against war or the obstacles to peace . the melodies were not memorable . it is in sharp contrast to neil youngs most recent release dealing with the same topic .
