wild ox moan ? i special ordered this album after reading a review in jazziz praising the artist and his work . one week later i could n't wait to unwrap it and stuff it into my cd player ... ... ... ..awful , pure and simple . as i continue to read flowery reviews i am bewildered . weak and reedy voice , poor recording , background instrumentals muffled and distracting . the title wild ox moan about says it all . honestly , i can not make it through a single song or through the album at a single sitting
