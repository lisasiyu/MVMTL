jimmy : please stick with the postal service ! as a big fan of the postal service ( their `` give up '' easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums ) , i had high expectations for this dntel record , as jimmy tamberello is one half of the postal service . big mistake . listen to the samples : if you like what you hear , then buy it ; if you do n't like what you hear , do n't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given . worthwhile songs on this cd : 1 ) '' ( this is ) the dream of evan and chan '' ( the postal service remix is available on itunes , and is a better version than what 's on the cd ) , sung by ben gibbard of death cab and postal service . 2 ) '' last songs '' is if anything , relaxing . i recommend getting these two songs on itunes and leaving it at that , save some money . the cd 's too expensive for two decent songs . jimmy tamberello has another digital project that he works called figurine and ( more recently ) james figurine , it 's essentially a catchier , poppier version of dntel , more in line with postal service
