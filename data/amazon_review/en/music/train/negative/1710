huh ? this is a joke . it has too much uninspired music from browne 's later albums , and leaves out classics like `` that girl could sing . '' sadly , there are no decent collections of jackson browne 's music yet released , and fans will still have to get all of his great albums separately and make their own collections . from other reviews , i gather that rock snobs are frustrated by the album 's omission of `` obscure gems . '' and people like me who just want to hear the great songs we grew up with are equally disappointed .
