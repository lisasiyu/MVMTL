one step forward two steps back following on from the fantastic 'the duel ' allison moorer 's latest release 'getting somewhere ' is a massive , massive disappointment . quite simply the material on 'getting somewhere ' is weak and gutless . on the rare occasions moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'the duel ' - such as on hallelujah & new years day - earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish , pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! business and pleasure rarely mix and moorer should take a long , hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing rs field next time around . if moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then earle is simply not the man for the job . moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre ( she can write a mean song too ! ) . this cd showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately
