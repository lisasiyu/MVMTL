should n't have been me my mistake . i had only heard `` should 've been the one '' which i thought sounded very good . that , however , was the only song produced in the studio and unfortunately the only song i liked enough to justify the purchase . the rest of the songs are live , apparently recorded at a small venue , if you can judge by the applause . like i said ... my fault . not saying any of the songs are bad . maybe more of them will grow on me . just not what i expected . moral : it pays to listen to most of a cd before you buy it . ( duh ) you never know what you 're gon na get
