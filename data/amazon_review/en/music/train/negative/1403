? what is this compilation have to do with anything ? these are a bunch of essential songs with a few remixes that are already on other cd 's ! gold ? where in the hell is the platinum collection at ? i was hoping to fine more rare remixes from the artists listed on this cd , instead of nothing . hip-o records should be more focused than the efforts of this project . what about the other eric b & rakim expanded projects ( uncut , please , unlike the gold album they did for them ... ) uptown records compilation re-release , marley marl 's first jams on mca ... who 's with me on this ? even better , how about helping with bep to stop selling out and making quality hip hop music again . i suggest some real crate-diggers for the hip-o staff in the future because this cd is a redicule of hip hop music , and they 're not doing jackbone for r & b either ! i got one name for that : switch 's full-length albums on cd ! hip-o and mca/geffen/universal , if you 're not going to at least make up you minds what name to use to lead the company , stop keeping the people waiting for quality products . i will not buy this so-called hip hop gold cd because it 's junk !
