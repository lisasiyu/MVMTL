know the feeling of eating too much sour candy ? thats exactly how this album feels ! you know , some irish songs and influences are good , but this is ridiculous . when 95 % of your lyrical content is irish at least keep it interesting . ( spicy mchaggis jig ? ? ? what the ... . ? ) so i say if your even interested in this cd or something 95 % irish , get drunken lullabies or swagger by flogging molly instead , if you dont already have them . id also recommend the new murphys cd `` the warriors code '' if you want faster irish music done good . i give it 2 stars because its not nearly as bad as some of the other stuff out there . oh yeah rocky road to dublin kicks arse ... .thats about the only reason to even put this cd on . easily the worst dkm albu
