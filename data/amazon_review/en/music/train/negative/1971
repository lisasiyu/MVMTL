bill evans he 's not in his interminably boring , mice type liner notes , brad mehldau goes to great lengths dispelling the notion that he might sound like bill evans . the message being , `oh golly , there 's so much more going on in my playing-please . ' well , i can assure you , bill evans he 's not . he would n't qualify to give bill evans a cab ride uptown . matter of fact , he sounds more like watered down keith jarrett-nothing very original going on here . and if you need 10,000 words of liner notes to explain what you 're doing-guess what-you ai n't doing squat . as a pianist who 's been playing modern jazz for 40 years , i can tell you to sit this set out . and if you want bill evans or keith jarrett , go get the real thing .
