i hate this this album sucks . the song are soooooooo boring . it 's just like listening to cold play but even cold play being on drugs , because sometimes people do n't do things as well when they 're drunk or on drugs . so , if cold play was on drugs they would not play good music and they already suck and levy is like way worse than cold play so what that does that say about their music . it 's just so bad . the guitar player needs to take more lessons , maybe from the lead guitar player from new found glory becuase he rocks . ok that 's all . jason mitchel
