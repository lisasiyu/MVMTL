awful : ( i love balkan beatbox and matisyahu.. but `` so called seder '' was a so called ... nightmare ! i was actually appalled i had purchased it without hearing many of the songs . i know it 's acceptable to say certain things in rap/hip-hop.. but when it comes to our music.. please do n't even go there ! ! i was hoping for something more along the lines of balkan beatbox or matisyahu , but sadly suprised at the lyrics i was hearing and sent it back to j-dub with a letter why.. *sigh
