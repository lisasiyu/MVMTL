hit & miss set first of all krs-one is one of the greatest rappers & story-tellers ever & ai n't nobody out now in rap can even hold his shoe laces when he breaks things down.having said that & understanding he did n't fully want this album out he still has n't knocked me out with a album all the way through in way over a decade.he has had some tight jams & of course his flow still will just leave you dizzy but the music & subject matter are pretty much the same & he has n't challenged his full powers as a mc in quite some time.he still has the words & flow to roll you over but albums like this & others of recent time just do n't even begin to do this man justice when you remember & grew up on his best stuff.but regardless i 'll always listen to him.he truly changed & flipped the game
