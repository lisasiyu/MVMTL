marc bolan is dead everybody seems to think this band is innovative or something . they sound exactly like 'beard of stars ' era t-rex . well , almost , because ac does a lot more layering with tons of effects . what are they hiding ? the lyrics ? anyway , if you 're going to rip people off , you should give props . shame on animal collective
