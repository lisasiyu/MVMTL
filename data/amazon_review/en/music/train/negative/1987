should 've researched it more ... after much much excitement and almost 20 bucks layed out i was extremely disappointed . the music was really slow , boring and rather dull . the songs start to seem like they 're the same as the lack ones . maybe i 'm just too used to other trance but i couldnt ' find any trance in this cd
