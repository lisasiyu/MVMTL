uh , yeah ... . aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band i 've ever heard , these guys just really do n't do it for me . a lot of the music is fairly decent , but the singer is just incredibly annoying . now , i am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection , but this dude is really bad . i 've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that i 'd rather listen to . but like i said , the band overall is n't completely terrible . they 're decent musicians , and i like a lot of the music , but i just really can not get around that singer . ordinarily , it 's not a good idea to judge a band by their name , but um ... this is n't one of those times
