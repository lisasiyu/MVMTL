an embarrasment to reggae i bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at amazon . what a major disappointment this disk is . embarrasingly amateur , with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses , it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well . another case of & quot ; dumbing-down & quot ; music for children , something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music ( the outstanding putamayo series for example is presented no frills , no dumbing-down ) . good & quot ; children 's music & quot ; inspires both parents and kids , and kids react positively to that in their parents . a shame to pay $ ... for this disk
