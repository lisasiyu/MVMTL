judy is great but the elektra cd is awful i was stunned by how bad this cd sounds . i 'm no expert , so i ca n't give you a precise description with proper terminology . suffice it to say it 's a bad job of transferring the recordings to cd . i later bought the gold version , and the difference is like night and day . judy collin 's voice is too wonderful to let this awful cd prevent you from really hearing her . the gold version is worth the extra money
