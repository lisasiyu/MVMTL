harping up the wrong tree anyone who buys this cd thinking it has something to do with harp music is going to be very disappointed . there 's nothing of the tranquility and serenity of the harmonious harp here . what you get is rather percussive and at times repetitive pianoplaying , seemingly based on random chords . the sort of stuff you do n't want to play for more than ten minutes . buyer beware
