vague noodling knopfler has once again fallen far short of the promise inherent in those long ago days of dire straits . perhaps he is attempting to be mr. atkins reincarnate , but if that is the case then he should buy the white shoes and move to florida . simply put , a terrible album with little to recommend it .
