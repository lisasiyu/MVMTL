not original artists this cd does not have the original artists performing the songs , which is all that really needs to be said about this cd . i normally would have listened to cuts from the cd , but i do n't have a sound card at work and made the mistake of ordering it without listening to it . still , you should n't have to read between the lines in the description to find out if a cd with popular songs are being sung the way you like to hear it
