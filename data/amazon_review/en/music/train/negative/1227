fat joe - me , myself and i fat joe 's ( a.k.a . jose antonio cartagena ) seventh solo album is `` me , myself and i '' . those familiar with his work may have noticed the album cover is similar to one of better releases his third album `` don cartagena '' . the bronx mc keep 's this release short at twelve track 's , and this album has three guest appearances which come from the game , lil wayne and h-mob . production comes from street runner , lv , the runner 's dj khaled , nu jerzey devil & scott scorch . the runner 's provide some of the best production on `` no drama '' ( clap and revolve ) a grimy sounding cut . lyrically fat joe is his usual braggy less then entertaining self for most of this album . his lyrics are as egotistical as his album titles . my problem with fat joe resides in the fact that he never puts any of his people on , instead following the same formula time after time . the terror squad is a crew full of talented mc 's ( even with the loss of cuban link and triple seis ) and singer tony sunshine has a lot of potential - all of them get put on the back burner each year for a less then impressive fat joe album . two of this album 's closing track deserve some praise - fat joe 's dedication to his mom on `` bendicion mama '' and the follow up cut `` story to tell '' are decent . buyer beware , satisfaction not guaranteed
