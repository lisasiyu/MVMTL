some wonderful songs but a boring album ... i 'm a huge u2 fan but maybe i 'm the only one on this world who does n't like r.e.m . very much.i find songs like drive , everybody hurts and man on the moon ( one of my favourite ) very beautiful.but the other songs are boring and ripetitive.i do n't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.i hope one day i 'll understand this band..
