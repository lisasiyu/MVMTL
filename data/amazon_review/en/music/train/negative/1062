more like a sophomoric effort i do n't know what happened with this effort . i have yet to stop listening to hellbilly deluxe and sinister urge . however , i have listened to educated horses ( through ) once , maybe twice . i just can not make myself listen to it . and that is really sad because i love rob zombie and his music
