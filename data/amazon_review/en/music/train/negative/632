sounds of the 90 's without the melodies i 've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code ' . this band was just getting worse with every album . eventually , i caught on and stopped wasting my $ . i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright . who the @ $ # % @ are these dumb reviewers ? are they getting paybacks ? is this politics or music ? live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that . they still know how to play , but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive , appealing songs . also , maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich is n't helping ! only put 1 song on my mp3 players ... = 1 star
