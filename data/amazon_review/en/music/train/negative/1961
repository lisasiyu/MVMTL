bollocks to this this ranks right up there with the blondie reunion cd as completely unnecessary . why ? these guys are relics . and i would n't care if the music was great ( i.e . joe strummer & amp ; the mescaleros new stuff ) but this is just awful . why are they still trying to act like jittery teenagers ? and the spedding songs here are just wretched , at least the shelley-penned numbers are merely bad . by all means , buy singles going steady or operator 's manual , as they are priceless landmarks of punk rock , but leave this modern dreck in the rubbish tin . i picked it up for half-price and should have known better
