20 years ago ... twenty years ago , michael jackson was recognizably human , and although he was already considered to be slightly eccentric , he was the most beloved pop star on the planet . and this album , even though it seemed harmless enough at the time , marks the point where things started to fall apart for him . the infamous pepsi lite commercial shoot where he was seriously burned was part of an ad campaign coordinated with this album 's release . it was the last album made by the jacksons/ jackson 5 , and the only one ( so far ) with all six brothers on it . the album was rather hastily put together to fill a contractual obligation . michael contributes a couple of songs : the truly horrifying ballad `` be not always '' and the danceable `` state of shock . '' `` state of shock '' was a collaboration with mick jagger , and it is now best remembered as the finale of the live aid concerts in the summer of 1985 . mick did it as a duet with tina turner ( and their wardrobe reveals went much better than justin timberlake 's and janet jackson 's did at the 2004 super bowl . ) and i think i have digressed , but that 's ok because the other songs on the album are all done by the ( then ) less famous and ( now ) less notorious jackson brothers . these are assorted mid-1980s r & b pop numbers , nothing memorably good , nothing memorably bad . the most enjoyable song , `` body '' features the most obscure jackson brother , marlon , and also features an enjoyably moronic chorus which goes , `` girl i love your body , so wo n't you come home with me ! '' or words to that effect .
