good first effort , but get the later stuff jill sobule really hit it big with her first hit & quot ; i kissed a girl & quot ; , which is on her second self-titled album & quot ; jill sobule & quot ; . this first album is n't really all that good ; like she was still finding herself . for a better album , check out her & quot ; jill sobule & quot ; album or even better & quot ; happy town & quot ;
