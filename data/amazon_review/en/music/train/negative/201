why rbx ? why didnt you bring the skills you have ? rbx is one of my favorite rappers , he has a dark , sinister style . instead of dropping a unique , straight hip hop album ( which is what i was expecting ) . he decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf @ $ # ing family.this is more of a compilation because rbx only does a small handfull of songs solo , and predictably , those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos . so rbx i ask you , why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label , when you could have done a real dope solo album ( how do i miss heatmizer ) and package a compilation of your artists with the album ? i could not be more disappointed . i would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd , sorry x , you wasted your talent on this album , dont be mad at me
