not worth the money there is a reason why you can not listen to any tracks on amazon- you would n't buy if you could . i read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way . this band is nothing even near metallica . i have thrown the disk away- do n't bother
