disappointment i liked very much the film black orpheus , but when i bought this record i hoped to listen the music , not the movie . most of the tracks has sounds of the movie overimposed to the songs , as would be heard in the movie . then why not buying the movie ? when i listen a cd i care about music , that is contaminated in this record . and does n't help neither that songs are changed abruptly frequently . besides , the art of the cover is very poor , dishonors the movie , and the written comments claim that the sounds of the movie are a plus , recalling the scenes of the movie were the sounds appear , improperly : the `` oh no ! '' sound of `` frevo '' that is commented does not apear in the movie as said . as a summary , verve did wonderfull editions of jazz , but this edition falls far behind the standards of both verve and the film ; clearly , brazilian music does n't seems to be verve territory judging buy this edition
