who is this band and what have they done with modest mouse ? modest mouse are reported to be living somewhere inside this album . i , however , can not find them . this is the first music they have released that is completely forgettable . it comes out of the speakers , into your ears and then disappears . all of the previous mm releases , and i 've heard , loved and lived them all , are unique , enduring and beloved pieces of music ; this record is not of that ilk . and that 's a real shame , mm are one of the finest bands of the past 10 or 15 years , right up there with the likes of ween , built to spill and all of the jagjaguwar bands . oh well , a rare miss . i 'm still a huge fan , still gon na go see them whenever the tour rolls around ( definately go see them live , when isaac is n't too drunk , the shows can be legendary ) , still gon na love the freak rock phenomena that is modest mouse , just ca n't seem to get behind this release .
