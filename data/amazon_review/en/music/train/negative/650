it was extreamly difficult to listen to this cd as the music competed so much with the spoken word . i would n't be able to reccomend this for bed time at all as you have to listen so hard to hear the words that it becomes very & quot ; unrelaxing & quot ; . however if you chose to listen to this during the day this would probably work for you
