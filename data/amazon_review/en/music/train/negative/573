the answer is no during pearl jam 's riot act tour in 2003 , sleater kinney was the opening band.i got tickets for the show . in preperation for the concert , i picked up a few kinney albums . first this one . for one i had heard songs at the college station i worked and since one member janet weiss was in quasi ( a great band ) i thought it could n't be all bad . at first listening to the albums it was alright . then it got annoying . those high pitched screams from the singer began to be fingernails on a chalkboard . repetitive , middle of the road punk . then came the concert . once sleater hit the stage , everyone and i mean everyone around me had no clue who they were . they were all asking me , who 's this ? i had to tell them all . no one was digging the concert . minamal applause . no dancing or cheering , nothing . the songs that night did n't flow . the usual screaming was , as always , ear screeching and annoying . a few people mis-took the bassist for a man , but we were in the nose-bleed seats . once sleater-kinney did their last song and walked off stage the audience clapped with much enthusiasim , cause they knew they were finally done
