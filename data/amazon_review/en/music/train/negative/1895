waist of time ... when i first heard the song inside it got stuck in my head for a long time , and everytime i heard it after that it would get stuck in my head even longer ... so i decided to go buy the album.. which was one big mistake.. the vocals are horrid and theres not one good song to get into.. it doesnt even deserve 1 star but i give them one for some how making it to tv..so dont waist your time or money on this band , go for bands like from zero , pillar , or thousand foot krutch
