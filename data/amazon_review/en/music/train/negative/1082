total disappointment i have awaited the release of this particular art of noise lp onto cd for 20 years . this title was my all-time favorite art of noise record . upon opening up the cd & quickly jumping to track 2 - `` beat box '' only to find out it has been replaced by the version that appeared on `` who 's afraid of the art of noise '' . you can imagine my disappointment ! i thought for sure after 20 years i would finally have the original break dance classic of `` beat box '' in the digital format . anyway , being a true art of noise fan for many years , this was definately a let down
