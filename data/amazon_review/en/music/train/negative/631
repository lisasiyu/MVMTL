golden ears a moose from california compared audra 's `` bill '' with one done by jane monheit . i took his advise and listened to both . audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz . the moose from california has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.this is a sad recording as far as jazz goes . it should be in the cabaret bin . absolutely ! !
