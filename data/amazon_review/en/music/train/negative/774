repetitive i am quite dissappointed in this cd , being won over by the sound bytes that i sampled here at amazon , which are very beautiful . imagine listening to one of the samples presented here 20 times in a row . the sample represents the whole of the song , which is repeated over and over and over with a solo over the top . to me , this signifies a lack of creativity . there is so much potential in each of these songs , but it is as if avishai wrote 4 measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song . maybe my expectations were too high , expecting a billy childs type of song structure . i will be looking at selling my cd so i can recoup at least a portion of my investment
