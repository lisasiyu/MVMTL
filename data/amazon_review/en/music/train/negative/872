the new sony is very poor quality i bought this never having problems from amazon.com before . they did not state that this was a sony product and when i received it , all the cd had on it was a root kit virus . it would not even play in my cd player . when i tried to read the cd to copy and burn the `` wav '' files to a new cd so i could just listen to the music , all there were on the cd was executables and no sound files . sony is very poor quality now and i do not want to buy it again
