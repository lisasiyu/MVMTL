disappointed , i miss the old ub's i miss the old ub40 stuff you could skank to . the beats on this album 's tracks are too & quot ; club & quot ; for me . labour of love and labour of love ii are some of the best reggae albums ever made , this one though is has almost that & quot ; industial & quot ; sound to it that 's so popular in europe . if it were n't for & quot ; come back darling & quot ; and & quot ; mr fix it & quot ; this cd might be a total loss . so it gets 1 star for each of those songs from me
