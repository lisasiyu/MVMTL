wow the lead singer 's song delivery is quite mopey . the keyboard solos are rather pedestrian , but was way ahead of it 's time , it 's match for match with `` free jazz '' and japanese noise . the guitarist is quite talented and to be honest , the rest of the band weighs down his true potential . the song `` riders in the storm '' is a good exhibit a on why a band should not record whilst taking barbituates
