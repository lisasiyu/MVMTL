no impact i 'll probably never run out of music to discover . it seems that no matter how many stones i turn , no matter how exhaustive my search is , there will always be atleast a few gems i 'd somehow overlooked . for me , xtc are one of those gems . i picked up black sea at the local record shop and it completely knocked me out . maybe it was those huge drums , or the way everything felt like it was pulling apart at the seams . regardless of what it was , i had to have more . over the course of the next few weeks i proceeded to buy drums and wire followed by english settlement . again , both were completely stellar albums , especially d & w. then there was skylarking . it was supposed to be the xtc album , their masterpiece . people compared it to the likes of pet sounds and proclaimed it one of the best albums of all time . i 'm sad to say it did n't live up to the hype for me . in fact , i find it to be downright mediocre . for me this is where they dropped the ball and failed to pick it back up . i 'll admit that i miss the more raw , punk like energy that was found in early xtc , but that 's not why i dislike this album . i actually enjoy alot of mellow , lavishly produced music , but skylarking just sounds ... bland . none of the songs seem to stand out and the production is borderline soft rock . every time i listen i hear less of what made me love xtc in the first place and more of why i ca n't stand phil colins . even the songwriting itself is weak , lacking strong hooks and any sort of weight to help the music rise out of the syrupy muck that todd rundgren laid out . i just do n't see what all the fuss is about .
