no title i find it really difficult to write a review about this particular record , actually to write a review about any album by six organs of admittance . that is because this album works in a very non-verbal way . it does not create any clear thoughts in me while i listen to it . instead , it is very meditative and transcendent , it speaks directly to me in a very profound way . i find this record to be very calm and quiet but also incredibly intense at the same time , and it never forces anything . this music has about the same effect on me as buddhist mantras and chants do , but i find it even better . the music itself is consisted of acoustic guitar and drones . there are very few pieces that are lyrical on the record . the compositions themselves are brilliant and they make a brilliant whole . the record works as one piece perfectly for me . i would n't compare this music to devendra banhart , vetiver or any other new acoustic outfit , nor would i compare it to any droney `` post-rock '' bands . comparisons are generally just something silly and irrational , something that does n't exist , but for the purpose of trying to describe this undescribable and unique music i 'd say it sounds like mixture of forementioned buddhist chants , droney music like coil 's time machines and brilliant acoustic guitar . six organs 's music is unique and true , honest , without any pose , music that is concentrated on substance , not image , and i would recommend it to people who honestly strive to be that way..
