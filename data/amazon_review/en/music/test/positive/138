4 stars outkast has always been an unbelievably creative and experimental group . arising from the south , which is typically plagued with no-talent wannabe-emcees who ca n't seem to keep their platinum teeth off each other 's rectum , they manage to always provide conventional and beautiful music . their dope debut southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was just a mere introduction to their skills , and would only pave the way for their untouchable classic known as atliens . on this superb sophomore lp , outkast gave us an unbelievable grouping of introspective and thought-provoking music , with their own p-funkish beats . their experimentation only continued on their third album aquemeni , which is yet another superb album . on this one , big boi and andre 3000 experiment with some new sounds , go for some new creative subject matter , and slow down the tempo on a few notes . their most recent album , 2000 's stankonia , showed how dynamic they were , giving us a mix of unbelievable , up-tempo party jams , feel-good music , and of course , the signature introspection . 2003 promised outkast 's return , and they indeed delivered . firstly , speakerboxx/the love below are two albums packaged as one . speakerboxx is big boi 's album , and the love below is andre 3000 's solo effort . each member of outkast basically star on each album and provide their own musical landscapes and styles . they each released a single , one per album , hence making this feel as if it is two different albums , and in fact it is . therefore , for my review , i will review it as two separate albums , to keep the comparisons separate throughout the majority of the review until my conclusion . keep in mind as you read the review , before i begin , that both albums are very different , and i will review this with an open mind and as a true fan of outkast , which i am ... enjoy ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - firstly , i will review big boi 's album speakerboxx . big boi 's disk is loaded with the typical outkast sound , keeping the experimentation level on a minimum . big boi has always been a dope lyricist , so i look forward to listening to this album with high hopes that he has n't fallen off . the guest list looks pretty impressive , including some big mainstream names , and a couple of lesser known names . still , big boi is the star , and he has proven in the past that he can carry the mantle . let 's hope that the same applies here . track

rated ) big boi 's half of this double album , known as speakerboxx kicks off with a skippable intro , which then leads us into `` ghettomusick '' . the synthesized beat immediately kicks in , making you think that it would be some sort of up-tempo techno track . after a bit of the beat playing , we get some quick , danceable , party music and big boi kicking off a flow . the sound of the song is fast and smooth , perfect for those long high-way drives . big boi sings for the first part , and raps for the latter part . i like to consider this an introductory track , experimenting with techno , r & b , and hip-hop elements . as a sidenote , id like to say that i am a huge fan of experimental music . i love it , which is why i enjoyed the most recent experimental musical albums such as phrenology by the roots and electric circus by common . when classic , well-respected artists decide to cross into new styles of music , its always interesting and fun to me , and those with an open-mind . `` bowtie '' features the southern , p-funkish elements which make outkast who they are . featuring some slamming trumpets , that typical dungeon family singing , and some nice guitars , big boi drops some pretty dope lyrics about a certain female who ca n't seem to get off his mind . the track might seem a bit commercial , but its a pleasure to listen to due to the lyricism of big boi and the dope production done by jazze pha ( who is typically a commercial producer , but has his moments ) . big boi proves on this track that he is indeed still a dope rapper , and has yet to fall off . `` the way you move '' is big boi 's lead single . big boi 's unbelievably creative lyrics adds some nostalgia , taking us back to the groups ' extraordinarily light-hearted work found on aquemeni . the production is one of those pieces that will be stuck in your head for ages to come , with its pounding trumpets . the background r & b/soul vocals only add to the song , giving the song an unforgettable , seductive feeling to it . big boi 's mic presence is unforgettable , and this is an ideal lead single for big boi . killer mike joins big boi on `` bust '' . the melodic production is dope , and the background vocals are reminiscent of some of the silly singing found on d-12 's debut devil 's night . killer mike and big boi drop ill introspective verses , reminiscing about the past . the production is , as expected , loud and pounding , but also melodic and listenable . immediately with the first listen , you can tell this is an outkast track , and a damn good one at that . `` church '' has the incredible makings of a classic , but is shut down by seemingly annoying and overabusive production . the subject matter revolves around big boi questioning his religion due to the problems surrounding not only himself , but the entire world . big boi mixes introspection with some creativity and heart , backed by some thought-provoking lyrics . lyrically and subject-matter-wise , this track is dope , but the production and organization needs a lot of work . as i said earlier , youve got to have an open musical mind and be a fan of true hip-hop lyricism and elements in order to fully appreciate the experimental sounds found on speakerboxx . skipping ahead we arrive at `` flip flop rock '' . a commercial jay-z joins killer mike and big boi on this dope introspective collaborative crew joint . big boi touches on street violence , racism , and oppression that is seemingly killing the blacks of this country , as well as the other kids in the streets . big boi 's introspective lyrics and political views are interesting , and add a new twist to those who doubted how ill of an emcee he is . the melodic hook is one of those dope ones , but soon jay-z appears on the track and gives us some egotistical , somewhat materialistic lyrics . i dont understand all of the hype over jay-z 's black album due to the fact that jay-z is nowhere near showing me that he is going to change , and turn underground again . his verse on this song is very commercial , and leads me to believe that his so-called `` final '' album might just be a repeat of other washouts he 's had in the past . i sure hope not ... because the heads deserve a lot more . its interesting that the dungeon family themselves provide the first true classic on speakerboxx , that being `` reset '' . cee-lo and khujo goodie from goodie mob join up with big boi to give us the dopest song on big boi 's disc . the slow-tempo production and haunting background vocals provide an amazing atmosphere , and a somewhat nostalgic trip back to the days of the classic atliens , where outkast gave us a classic-filled album of this caliber . big boi , cee-lo and khujo drop some memorably dope introspective verses , touches on the evils of the world from government , to racists , to life itself . the overall feel of the track is unbelievable , as it is a true classic . speakerboxx is nowhere near being as good as any of the previous outkast albums by themselves . its obvious to me that big boi fits a lot better with andre 3000 than without him . this album , unlike his partner 's disc , stays true to hip-hop and retains the traditional outkast sound for most of the tracks , along with a few new soundscapes and experimental sounds . this album incorporates lots of guests , but the majority do a great job and manage to keep up with big boi . a lot of the songs are bangers , and it stays at a great level of quality , but nowhere near the classics that they have put out in the past . however , speakerboxx is a pretty dope stand-alone album with its share of hits and misses . 3.75 stars -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - moving on , we now arrive to andre 3000 's somewhat solo effort , known as the love below . this is about as farfetched as andre has ever gone in his career . experimentation and eclectic music is the name of the game here , as andre gives us some unique musical landscapes , touching on every single musical style thinkable , from jazz , to soul , to r & b , to hip-hop , to rock , and beyond . as i said at the beginning of this review , i am a huge fan of experimentation by artists who have already proven themselves , thus i fully respect andre 's decision to explore his creativity as he has done on the love below . staying true to hip-hop is something that i treasure , but andre has proven in the past that he is capable of doing that , so i will review this album on a completely unbiased level . track list & rating : `` the love below '' 1 - the love below ( intro ) ( not rated ) 2 - love hater ( 4 stars ) 3 - god (

up next is andre 3000 's lead single , entitled `` hey ya '' . the fast tempo , guitarish beat giving the track an amazing light-hearted feel . however , besides the excellent , fast tempo production , andre 3000 spits fire with his amazing vocal display . the song has a very mid 50 's sort of quirky feel to it , making it one of those songs that many heads are afraid to admit they enjoy . me ? i love it . the beat is tight , the singing is amazing , and its difficult for you not to enjoy this melodic musical medley . i feel as if andre chose the perfect lead single , just like i felt big boi did on his album . `` roses '' and `` behold a lady '' are eerily similar love songs . both songs feature some seductive , r & b/soul vocals directed to a woman . keeping the familiar outkast p-funk , mixed with new forms of music and nice melodies is something that andre has seemingly perfected the art of doing this merger . the second track of the two is a much more up-tempo track , with a tiny bit more seductiveness to it , and some more appeal . the synthesized melody is different than the last , proving that the only familiar parts would be the seductiveness of the vocals and andre 's choice of subject matter . the love below hits a speed bump with `` pink & blue '' . i appreciate the elceptiveness of the album , as long as it makes sense . what we have here is a cadre of sounds put together in a fast pace , making the song sound like a complete mess , and almost unlistenable . thusfar , this is the only extremely weak moment on either album . skipping ahead past some of the average moments of the love below , we get to the closing track , strangely titled `` a life in the day of benjamin andre '' . believe it or not , andre does something on this track which he has yet to do ... and thats rap ! ! ! ! unbelievably enough , andre ends his disc with what brought him to the fame in the first place . production-wise , its pretty simplistic , with drums , a clap , and some weird background effects . this song feels a lot like something that was pulled from atliens , due to its simple production and song concept . the subject matter is creative as f*ck , as andre uses his `` art of storytelling '' to summarize his entire life into one day . the song has no catchy hook of any sort , but that does n't matter due to the fact that andre gets personal , even touching on his relationship with erykah badu . a fitting close to andre 's disc . the love below is eclectic , unique , and at times just plain bizarre , but its primarily good . the musical variety is shown , and andre 's maturity and growth as an artist is something to give praise about . his disc is filled with mainly good or great songs , and pretty much only one flaw . old-school outkast fans probably wont dig it too much unless they have an open mind , and most likely neither will backpacker heads . however , i truly believe that this is an album not only for hip-hop fans , but for fans of all music respectfully . 4 stars -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - in listening to speakerboxx/the love below as a combined album , i often wondered if big boi and andre 3000 could really separate and keep apart without losing a tad bit of the quality . i mean , lets be honest , they are an unbelievable duo and their different points of view as well as rhyme styles create a wonderful landscape of lyricism and music . apparently , they indeed prove that they can . i honestly had no clue what to expect from this album except that i honestly trust outkast to give us good music , and im glad i did . i always walk into an outkast album with an open mind set , and i always walk out with a smile knowing that they have yet to make a bad album . the question on many fans minds is : which album is better ? well , in my own personal opinion , andre 3000 's album is slightly better and much more consistent this time around , and the music is unbelievable . however , big boi 's album is much more true to hip-hop with lyricism and such . my conclusion to this is that i highly appreciate that outkast gave us 2 discs this time around , but i believe that they belong together in order to give us the true classics which they are more than capable of . their experimentation is great , and this album will always be treasured by their fans , but i do believe that their part should only be temporary . it was dope how its 2 discs for the price of one , and thats even more the reason for me to reccomend speakerboxx/the love below . it is a dope album loaded with stuff to please everybody ... so get yourself a copy as soon as you can . overall rating : 4 stars
