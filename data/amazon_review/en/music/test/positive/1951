roxy music is the drug . this collection is older , but it 's 20 tracks long , and does include most of the essential roxy/ferry songs . included amongst all these killer songs is `` love is the drug '' , `` more than this '' , `` avalon '' , and `` slave to love '' . it would truly be impossible to fit everything on one disc , but the only things i really miss is roxy 's `` mother of pearl '' , and ferry 's `` kiss and tell '' and `` limbo '' . otherwise it actually does a great job as a `` best of '' . this being currently out of print however , you may have to hit the used stores , or deal with another `` hits '' album .
