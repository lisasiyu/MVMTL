these guys could sing for real i knew i had to buy this cd . i was 20 when force mds came on the scene in '84 , and their music was the soundtrack of my young adulthood . listening to their beautiful voices remind me how much i detest post 1990 music . this cd is a must for anyone who wants to hear what great harmonies sounded like back in the '80s
