genius at work : caution to those without taste there is no type of music in the entire world that can prepare you to experience aesop rock 's `` float '' . and that 's the way it should be . float is the most unique , in-depth , and complete look into the mind and thoughts of a master of his trade that i have listened to . blockhead , and aesop himself , create some of the darkest , most incredibly tangible beats that i have ever heard in my life and i just ca n't get enough of it . if you finally manage to digest and appreciate the cryptic beats then worry not , the lyrics will keep you busy for years to come . the sheer volume of words is tough to decipher as presented , but combined with his winding analogies and metaphors , it is nearly impossible to understand it all . that is more of a compliment than it seems as i could honestly listen to this entire cd without attempting to understand a single word , just simply being engrossed by the perfect harmony between his vocal inflections and his beats is enough for me . to be able to visually read aesop 's lyrics while listening to him takes him to a level no one will ever approach again . if someone like sage francis ( the closest to aesop as i 've seen ) tickles your fancy then give aesop a try , i promise he wo n't disappoint
