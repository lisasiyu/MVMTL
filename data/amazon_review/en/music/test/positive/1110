hmmm just imagine ... . if this was released by the generic nu-metal bands in 2002 , this album would be their best album . yea , my point is that in flames did n't sell out in rtr . they still have solos in most of their songs ( although less than their previous works ) and amazing riffs ( not as many dual ones as jesper and bjorn were able to produce before ) . and also anders voice has n't changed quite yet and still is as good as colony and clayman , with the addition of singing . even though it is a step down , it is still sounds like in flames . and speaking of a sell out album , i would reccomend soundtrack to your escape because that is a sell out ! songs i 'd reccomend from this album : reroute to remain drifter trigger transparent dismiss the cynic
