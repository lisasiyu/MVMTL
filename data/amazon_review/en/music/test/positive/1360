old songs - great sound still resonates nostalgia filled me as i listened to some of the most eloquent and poignant songs ever written and sung by the infamous michael hutchence , taking me back to the age of sixteen and absolutely loving the passion that surrounded this band . it was great to be re-aquinted with songs that opened up wonderful memories and experiences . definitely a must have for any cd collection
