brilliant . ineffably singular . you think you 've heard these symphonies before , but the combination of a smaller orchestra and period instrumentation with ur-text orchestrations makes these recordings a revelation . not the least of the set 's pleasures is zinman 's respecting of the real tempi called for in the scores - at times a tad faster than they 're usually played - which strips the music of the ponderous heaviness that too often creeps in . one reviewer loved the whole set except for the fifth , and i can understand why - the fifth here sounds unlike you 've ever heard it before . i 'd say , having listened , that 's a good thing . the best bargain in classical recordings this year
