misunderstood not sure what everyone else is upset about . either you like collective soul or you do n't . i love this album . it 's not a new release in that it 's mostly unplugged music . it 's without all the bells and whistles and it 's still great . i think if you just like cs for their 'music ' you wo n't like this cd , but if you like them for who they are and their lyrics , it 's a great cd . if you want a compilation of greatest hits , try 7 year itch , if you want the grass roots , from the ground up is for you . imh
