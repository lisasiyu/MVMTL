oh so beautiful ... .there 's nothing else like it i ca n't explain how powerfully this album moves me . at first listen , i was disappointed . there was no `` night of the swallow , '' no `` moving , '' or other rousing songs that make me want to dance , alone , in the night . then , i read someone 's review which spoke of listening to this album in a dark room alone . i made time for this album . time alone for me is scarce , but i missed kate and made room for her . we cooked together , went on long walks , even went running once or twice . i fell in love with `` sunset '' first . the flamenco guitars , the rhythm picking up , the multiple sky images . i listen to this and feel one with the sky . it is such a positive , beautiful album . listening to it feels like a religious experience . this is not party music . it 's not for socializing either . i had a good friend over and i just wanted to tell her to stop talking so i could soak in this beautiful , beautiful music . kate 's voice is softer here . she wears her motherhood comfortably , and it shows , yet she still has that incredible vocal range . i had thought that there was no surprises left in music for me . i was wrong . that does n't mean i like all songs equally . i listen to the songs on the first disk ( especially while running ) , but it 's disk 2 that captured my heart . `` sunset , '' then `` nocturn . '' then , sweet `` aerial : '' `` i want to be up on the roof i 've got ta be up on the roof up , up high on the roof up , up on the roof in the sun . '' i am trying to say that this album is a visceral experience . you have to live it , immerse yourself in it , give yourself over to it . for those of you disappointed with it , i recommend giving it another chance . especially listen to it outside . i think you might yourself similarly entranced as i was .
