first band on the moon ~ the cardigans i was very uncertain what to expect from this band and after i had borrowed it from the library it lay on my desk for quite some time and then i was like , it ca n't hurt to listen to it , so i did . it is good , but not as good as i had expected . the females vocals are a bit weak and the lyrics are not their strong point . then why do i give it four stars . well , the sound , and vibe are great and one starts to think back on 60 's pop and it is a blend of 60 's pop and modern rock . the book-let is shoddy with terrible photographs that seem to have been shot by a 7 year old kid and what is up with that hair . it is called using a comb ... ? even so , this is a good debut album that has some issues..
