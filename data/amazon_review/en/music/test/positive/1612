powerful and expressive singing with an amazing technique and control considering netrebko 's and villazon 's age- both are in their thirties- the maturity and command of their artistry is constantly moving ahead of their years . villazon , with all the bells and whistles of his top ringing notes , has becomes the spinto/italianate tenor extraordinaire of our time that gives us glimpses- although i hate to make comparisons- of correlli and di stefano . netrebko , as a soprano , is in a league of her own . her voice in any new recording sounds better than in her last one . the lyricim , color and communicating power of her singing trancends vulnerability , despair and hopelessness that are so well portayed in mimi 's duet . some bloggers hate netrebko 's guts and claim hype for her success . that 's a cop out . you can not sell out opera houses all over the world , and cds that have surpassed in numbers many classical recording of the past , based only on hype . there must be a substantive voice behind a beautiful face and body . i love and i know opera well , and i 've seen , live , many of the great sopranos of past forty years . and if i 'm flying across the u.s.a. to see netrebko at her carnegie hall debut- i was lucky to find one of the last tickets- is not hype . no body fooled me and no body made me do it . for some , the jury may be still out for these two opera superstars , but this cd is an example of extraordinary singing and is highly recommended . constantine a. papas el paso , texa
