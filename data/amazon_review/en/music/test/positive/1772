heavy metal machine music the intricate , extensive and sublimely rocking introduction to `` sweet jane '' which opens rock & roll animal must have made many of this album 's earliest buyers think they 'd fallen victim to a record company foul-up . surely the soaring guitars , thundering bass and tight , swirling drums with which they were confronted could n't have had anything to do with lou reed , legendarily laconic purveyor of atonal drones and decadent , rambling anecdotes . but sure enough , after three and a half minutes all that virtuosic showboating somehow morphed into the beloved velvet underground classic , with reed tossing off his lines in a voice by turns sardonic , indifferent and haunted . the result was , and still is , an album both the hardcore reed fan and the reed-hating hard rocker can dig , an eminently successful experiment in classic seventies metal from a man whose prior recordings had firmly established him at the opposite pole of the sonic spectrum . in truth , however , animal is less a lou reed album than an album of lou reed songs as ( stunningly ) interpreted by what was then alice cooper 's touring band . the leader 's presence here , while significant in establishing the requisite dark , dissipated and druggy ambience , is ultimately more counterpoint than fulcrum . instead , it 's the beautiful picking of guitarists steve hunter and dick wagner , ray colcord 's nightmarish organ runs and the stop-on-a-dime interplay of bassist prakash john and drummer pentti glan that are the real story , offering up post-allman brothers reinventions of velvets nuggets like `` heroin , '' `` white light , white heat '' and `` rock & roll '' as well as several tracks from reed 's outrageously underrated berlin lp . what starts out looking like the most awkward of musical marriages ends up being one of rock 's all-time greatest live albums , its dynamism literally unflagging from one end to the other . recommended for ... well , you
