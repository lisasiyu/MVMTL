decent effort for the record i 'm not really a dry kill logic fan per say . i own their first two records and i 've heard all of the new one . i 'd have to say the dead and dreaming is their `` crowning '' effort . now first off , nothing about this band is really original . there were already so many metal bands out there playing these same old riffs for over ten years so by the time dkl came around it was already old . however , the crushing energy and agression can not be ignored . the mellower parts are very boring and when he sings it sounds like linkin park-esque vocals . nothing special there . so anyway , if you like your metal loud and angry , but low on the technical and originality scale then dry kill logic is for you . this is their heaviest album and packs a punch . better than limp bizkit , korn , hatebreed and all that mess , but i 'll still stick to my slayer , opeth , and testament albums
