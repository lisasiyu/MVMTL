great album i do n't really write reviews but i wanted to throw in here that this is a great album , because there are so few reviews of it . if you liked his first you will like this to ; i do n't find either one any better or worse . also , watching that video they 've got on this amazon page , he seems to be pretty great live . but really , there 's not much else to say : if you liked his first , you wo n't be disappointed by this one .
