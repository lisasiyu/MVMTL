somewhere in my wicked miserable past ... . ... i must have done something good . this cd truly is a gift . i 've always been of the opinion that sweeney todd is sondheim 's best work . certainly my favorite . so to have it revisited to this magnitude gives me delicious validation . the performances are flawless , and their voices pay beautiful tribute to their theatrical predecessors . i am a compulsive collector of musicals on cds ( 71 at last count ) however , i am no expert on the intricacies of the craft , i just know what i like . this cd clearly pushes to the front of my collection and takes its place alongside les miserables , rent and the producers . if you are even considering purchasing this , do it , thank me later
