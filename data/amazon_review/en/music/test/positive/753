tiesto changed i honestly dont understand why does every artist in electronic music trying to change so much . take for example ferry corsten ... what happened to his beautiful tear-jerking tunes back when right of way was in . if you ever saw him , you 'd know how incredibly tallented he is . now he , as many others , have jumped on teh pop based train . tiesto , definitely puts a nice show on with his epic trance set presented on this cd ... . however , like many say , i really miss his 2003 2004 days ... if you ever heard a live set from those days , definitely his 2 dvd-s ... now that is quality . as far as sound production , mad props to the sound engineers ... by far it is the clearest highest quality sounding cd i have ever heard . song selection wise , hmmm as always , i could pick better , but i guess everyone has a different style , in what they like . i still stand by saying , go see the man live !
