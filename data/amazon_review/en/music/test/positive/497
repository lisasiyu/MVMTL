gerald albright is on fire here ! this is gerald 's latest effort , and i must say , it is a real smooth jazz gem.gerald really lets it fly here , with jazzy energy everywhere.there is n't a dud on the entire album ! while you may have heard of the popular single from this album on the radio , the funky `` to the max '' , there is more to this album than just funk.while there are a number of funky , upbeat and groovy tunes on this album , such as `` 4 on the floor '' , '' tothe max '' , '' throw yo ' hands in the air '' , and '' on the one '' , there are also an equal amount of more standard , traditional smooth jazz stylings as well.not like its a bad thing , far from it , because these tunes help to balance the album out and more , keeping it from going stale.some of the more standard tunes on the album are , '' why georgia '' , '' walker 's theme '' , and `` father 's lullaby '' , which gerald produced in remembrance of his late father.however , even the not so funky tunes shine here , with one of the best examples being gerald 's nice cover version of `` why georgia '' .there is also a vocal track on the album , '' condition of my heart '' , performed by a former `` boyz to men '' member.while the album as a whole is great , the best picks are , '' 4 on the floor '' , '' to the max '' , '' why georgia '' , '' throw yo ' hands in the air '' , '' on the one '' , and `` if you do n't know me by now '' .if you are looking for an exceptional sax player , then look no further , because you just found one.this album should be in everyone 's smooth jazz collection.i highly recommend it
