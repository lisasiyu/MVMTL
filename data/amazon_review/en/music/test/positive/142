with deeper listens ... ... .i have found that incubus ' masterpiece `` make yourself '' is much more of an obscure progressive metal album than a nu-metal album . take some deep listens into this album , and you will see that the musical progression of each song fits perfectly into the moniker of progressive metal , with a lot of funk , hip hop and nu-metal tossed into the mix . each song progresses with perfection and every note played is placed in just right . even brandon boyd 's amazing vocals are progressive , as is the concept of the album , which is making yourself out of your own ideas , thoughts and beliefs , not letting the government , authorities and the world shape what you believe and feel . the guitar riffs are intricate and amazing , as is the funky bass lines and the tight drumming . the dj adds much atmosphere and ambience to the record as well . brandon 's vocals are superb , having a wide range and deep metaphoric lyricism . i took this album for granted ever since i first picked it up , but in the new perception that i am in now , i appreciate it much more . i feel that it takes time for the true goodies hidden in the compositions of this album to come to the surface , and a face value listen wo n't reveal anything beyond a great `` nu-metal/rock/funk '' record . i think this is incubus at their finest ( which many would argue with , citing `` science '' as their best . true , i feel that science is amazing as well and shows elements of progression , but its `` make yourself '' where they reach their pinnacle ) . do yourself a favor and pick this album up , if you can get past the whole nu-metal stigma , you will find a true gem that is worth many repeated listens
