hypnotic , eerie , playful and a wonderful musical wild ride this 1974 release by guitarist ralph towner only reaffirms his genius and versatility as a musician/composer . teaming up with bassist eberhard weber , drummer jon christensen and saxophonist jan garbarek , towner took 3 other very highly developed musical personalities on a wild ride with him through dark spooky forests ( `` visitation '' ) , vast seas ( `` oceanus '' ) , deserts ( `` sand '' ) and more . towner lets forth some beautiful bill evans-esque piano musings on `` drifting petals '' , and even engages jan garbarek in a lively duo on `` winter solstice '' . things even get funky on `` piscean dance '' . bassist eberhard weber adds not only brilliant electric upright bass lines to the proceedings but goes further to add eerie choruses of cellos and bowed bass . jan garbarek proves a more than capable foil for towners full rich guitars and piano with his stark , icy , yet oddly soulful tones on tenor , soprano and flute . one of his best moments is `` nimbus '' with its tumbling flutes and stern tenor sax interjections . `` visitation '' gets my vote for spookiest track on an ecm release . this improv piece is very effective in conjuring up vivid images of walking through a spooky forest at night , screech owls in full cry and something lurking behind the twisted trees . all throughout , drummer jon christensen provides very flexible and empathetic playing , really listening to what 's going on and giving his all without overpowering the other musicians . he shoud definitely get a mvp award in the ecm stable ( as he 's appeared on so many ecm discs ) . prepare ye for a mindblowing listening experience !
