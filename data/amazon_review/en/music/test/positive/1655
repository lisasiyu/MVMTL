a wonderful album this album is filled with very emotive and original music . my favorites are `` marguerite , '' `` canyon song , '' and `` sail . '' oregon 's music is complex both rhythmically and harmonically : rhythm-wise , there is a 7/8 improvisation section in `` canyon song , '' harmonically most of the tracks feature clearly jazz-level chords . as a fincancially stingy person , even i have no regrets about buying this album . highly recommended for people interested in the art of music
