all hype aside ... this albums rocks . nothing is more brutal than black flag when fronted by rollins . in my opinion , this was black flag at their punk best . not much can be said about this album that has n't already been said . i highly reccomend anyone even slightly interested in getting into hardcore get this album , it 's a rush from start to finish
