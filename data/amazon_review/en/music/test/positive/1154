best of the last this is the definitive version of their last studio album . it contains more tracks and has a slightly different mix . none of the extra tracks are throwaway and some are arguably better than the songs on the original 'driving to damascus ' . is it their best album ? i think it has more depth with the lyrics than anything stuart adamson has done , and he was always a great lyricist ( these things being relative ) . if you do n't yet have 'driving to damascus ' , buy this version instead . if you already have dtd , consider getting this one for the extra songs and the slightly different mix courtesy of tony butler , the band 's bassist . it all works for me . great melodic guitar rock , some of it very hard-driving while some of it very soft . great , great lyrics . these are truly stuart 's last artistic statement
