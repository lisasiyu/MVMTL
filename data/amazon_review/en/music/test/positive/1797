great classics with a new twist this album contains many christmas favorites masterfully performed by culbertson , et al . it is definitely a disc that you will keep spinning all season long to promote the cheer . his wife michelle contributes beautifully on the vocals to `` some children see him . '' i have a lot of christmas albums in my collection , and i honestly have to say that this is one of the best i have yet to come across . this is definitely a compilation that the entire family will love . i highly recommend it to anyone who needs a little pizazz this holiday
