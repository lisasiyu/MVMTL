i ca n't believe some people do n't like this stuff ! some of the past reveiwers complained about a few things about this album , usually one of the following : 1 . the material is n't new . 2 . the material is unoriginal . 3 . the material is n't `` edgy '' enough . so , here are my rebuttals to these complaints , in hopes of straigtening a few things out ( sarcasm intended , since i 'm sure they really do n't care ) : 1 . of course it is n't new material , its called `` i 'm telling you for the last time . '' its really more of a greatest hits performance since jerry seinfeld never released an album . i agree it would have been cool to have some of his earlier performances on an album , but we do n't have the luxury , and i do n't know about you , but i 'd perfer to have my seinfeld stand up actually documented on a disc as opposed to the previous option , one minute chunks before and after an episode of his sitcom . 2 . there was a time when this actually was quite original . you see , jerry seinfeld got incredibly famous , and so many up and coming comedians started ripping him off that his observational comedic stylings became very common ( a point beautifully illustrated in the snl game show parody `` stand up and win '' hosted by jerry seinfeld himself ) . if the material and style sounds unoriginal , keep in mind , seinfeld pretty much did it first . 3 . why should comedy have to be `` edgy '' to be good ? jerry seinfeld was funny without being dirty or obscene ( the worst you hear in this cd is a handfull of `` g-d d-mns '' ) . i personally think that the r rated material is a crutch , if you ca n't be funny without being dirty , then you 're not really that good in the first place . so there you have it , my takes on the complaints against seinfelds only album . it 's some good stuff really , there 's a reason why people ripped off his act , and that reason is because he was a really funny , really sucessful comedian
