great collection from a tight group the black uhuru are one of reggae 's greatest vocal trio 's , the wailers of the 80 's if you will . this set covers a time period of their greatest popularity . all the songs on these 2 discs have a good groove to them , although some find that disc 2 seems to be repetitive . sly and robbie throw down some great `` riddims '' that will leave you awe struck . i highly reccommend this for people who just ca n't get past bob marley and the wailers , it is a must have for any music fan , espicially a reggae fan
