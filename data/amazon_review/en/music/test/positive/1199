highly recommended this is definately one of the best live albums that i have heard . it rocks from beginning to end . this is the way that blues traveler need to be heard ... ..they are a terrific jam band and this double album shows them off to perfection . 2 new songs are also showcased here , & quot ; regarding steven & quot ; and & quot ; closing down the park & quot ; . the booklet contains tons of photos and the lyrics to the two new songs . this album is a must for all blues traveler fans
