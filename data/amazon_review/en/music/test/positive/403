nice follow-up to adoration i am a more recent newsboys fan , so i will not pretend to be able to compare this album with all their previous work . but , devotion is a nice follow-on to the last album , adoration . it is not quite as strong in my opinion , but it does have some really good worship songs . overall , i think the newsboys are a strong modern worship band , and they have created some great songs on previous albums . as far as this disk does , my favorite song on the whole album is `` orphan '' which i think has a really different sound , and i also like `` devotion '' , `` i love your ways '' , and `` presence '' . although some may disagree i really do not like their version of `` blessed be your name '' . i think it pales in comparison to the original , or the version put out by tree63 . i literally hit the skip button everytime this song comes up . i hate to hear a great song ruined . having said that , i still recommend this album to any newsboys fans , or anyone looking for some quality modern worship music .
