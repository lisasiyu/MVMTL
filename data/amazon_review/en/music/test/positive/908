i ca n't believe it ! a new free design cd ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the music of the free design was a part of the fabric of my life in the late 60's/early 70 's . the intricate harmonies and intimate feelings shared by this family somehow cut through the psychedelic pomposities of the time and did what my favorite music always does : it makes you feel great ! to possess a new cd by the fd in the new millenium is nothing short of a miracle . the sound is unchanged : the layered vocals , the floating interjections of flute and recorder , the challenging compositions of chris dedrick are all intact . missing in action is the beguiling voice of ellen , although co-producer rebecca pellet deputizes well for her . bruce 's pipes are a bit rustier than before , but chris ' delight in recollaborating with his brother is evident . it 's so grand to hear music this honest , without a hint of gadgetry or synthesizer . track 7 , & quot ; the hook & quot ; , makes a sly dig at the triumph of machine over man in today 's pop scene ... ... .it 's the & quot ; cute & quot ; tune of the set . standout songs include the title tune and & quot ; mccarran airport & quot ; , kind of a & quot ; leaving on a jet plane & quot ; for the 2000s . if you like the free design at all , you should be enjoying this cd as soon as possible without compunction . if you are unfamiliar with the group , order the & quot ; best of & quot ; or the too-expensive japanese issue of & quot ; you could be born again & quot ; along with & quot ; cosmic peekaboo & quot ; ... ... ... you wo n't be sorry . if all free design fans purchase the new set , maybe we 'll persuade the dedricks to continue their excellence with further new recordings . i certainly hope so . music like this is too precious to take for granted
