one of my favorite recordings ! i am not a fan of the & quot ; sound of a countertenor or male alto. & quot ; i stumbled upon this recording & amp ; can not stop listening to it and recommending it to friends . scholl 's voice is not & quot ; plummy & quot ; but strong and vibrant and filled with colors . i would love to see and hear him in person-perhaps an opera if this is where he wants his career to go . i am a fan & amp ; have just purchased 3 more of his cd 's
