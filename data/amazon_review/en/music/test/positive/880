the best collection of 70 's music out there -- hands down instead of giving an individual review of each volume in this series , i decided to give one review on the final volume of the series . as a child in the 70s i grew up hearing these songs on the radio and the entire series really gave me a feeling of nostalgia . when i started collecting this series , i did n't always know each artist or even each song title , but once i spun the disc , the lyrics to these songs came back from the dark void of my memory . that was half the fun of this whole series . volume 13 was the one volume in the entire series that i remebered each song . volumes 12 , 13 , 14 and 15 are my favorite volumes . not each volume is a winner . volumes 4 , and 6 i felt were n't that great of volumes , but each volume contains at least 4-5 great gems . again , the entire series is great . this series and rhino 's did n't it blow your mind series are hands down the best series of 70 's music out there . i give both series five stars . if there was one thing that i felt that rhino missed on these was that they did n't take each series out to five more volumes . the would have given have a nice day 30 volumes and did n't it blow your mind 25 volumes . either way , the have a nice day series is my favorite 70s music complilation series and it has gotten lots of use in my cd player . if you like quirky am pop from the 70s , then this series is for you . you wo n't regret it . if your looking for more of the fm style 70s music , then get time/lifes sound of the 70s . after reading several reviews for the various volumes in this series , it 's clear the some people missed the entire point of this series . this entire series was supposed to resemble or be a throw back to those infamous compilation lps from k-tel that were everywhere in the 70s . this series was n't supposed to have great songs . just memorable ones .
