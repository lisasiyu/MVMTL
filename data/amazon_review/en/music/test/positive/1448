70 's inverted another good effort , i like this one better than the last . band is tight and the production is great . jeff 's jesus song is awesome . however , jim 's singing is poor . he 's a fine producer , but come on -- he would get polite applause at best at your local open mike . this is n't a 3rd grade pageant -- not everyone gets to sing , pal
