if i were on a desert isle i have listened to the don shirley trio since the 70 's . my favorite song of all time is & quot ; water boy & quot ; . if i were shipwrecked on a desert isle and i could only have one recording this is the one . this man knows how to make music for the soul . the trio 's interpretation of tunes that are familiar brings a whole new meaning to the songs . each time i listen i want to get up and move to the music
