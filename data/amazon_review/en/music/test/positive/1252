`` safe '' debut without a doubt the captain 's most commercial and publicly attainable album . this makes it the perfect place to start or to back off to when you need a break from avant gaurd . the most prominent feature on the production is , of course , the muddy water , pigpen growl of a voice that is the genius beefheart . his delta blues mannerisms are evident throughout the album , especially in the bluesy and semi uptempo `` sure enough and yes i do '' ; ry cooder covering the slide part extremely well . this is certanly blues , but not as we have all come to know and love it . the ryhthm section of the magic band truly shine on this recording . the bass and percussion breakdowns of `` zig zag wanderer '' and `` abba zabba '' are absolutely phenomenal . proof that you do n't need to show off and squese as many notes as possible into each second to sound great . cooder does an excellent job and certanly shows his influence as well . the rest of the magic band pull together to make a good , straight ahead ( at least for them ) album . `` call on me '' is an interesting little pop number in the style of otis redding . it 's one of the low points on the album , but that 's not saying much . this fades directly into the in-your-face blues-rock romp of `` dropout boogie '' . the lines-you wan na do what-i told you what and n ' what about after that-always get stuck in my head for a while . the little instrumental dittle , ding da ding da ding , you know , that part , is pretty damn cool aswell . `` i 'm glad '' always reminds me of a zappa and the mother 's song ( in a good way ) the thumping-hardhitting `` electricity '' is a favorite of mine . the high pitched voice covering the lines- high voltage man kisses night to bring the light to those who need to hide their shadow deed etc.-are extremely well done . this song starts out a couple of my favorite songs on the album , including the phycadelic `` yellow brick road '' and the amazing `` abba zabba '' . `` plastic factory '' does remind me of pigpen and the dead playing electric blues like big boss man or smokestack lightning . i was surprised to see that others had heard this connection , but it only makes sense . this is considered a compliment to the captain because the dead with pigpen were absolutely unstoppable . beefheart is a better harmonica player and has a better style and deliverance , but pigpen combined with the dead certainly stand up quite well to this album on alot of occurances . `` grown so ugly '' has kind of the same effect , but it leans much more toward the led zeppelin side of things . `` autumn 's child '' and `` where there 's woman '' are great phycadelic blues ballads that wrap up the album . that ends the original brilliant album entiteled safe as milk , but i think the bonus songs truly add something to the album , especially `` safe as milk '' . alot of these songs , or alternate versions of these songs are featured on the mirror man sessions , i may be hungry but i sure ai n't weird , and strictly personal ( i recommend these as well ) . they were all originally going to be on a double album called `` plain brown wrapper '' and would be better in this form . these song 's are the captian 's beginings into wierd phycadelia and add alot to the straight ahead feel of the original album . they show a true progression towards trout mask and lick my decals off , the pinnicle of beefheart and the magic band 's work . overall this is the perfect album for a begginer or long time fan who needs a break from the sometimes esoteric music of later albums
