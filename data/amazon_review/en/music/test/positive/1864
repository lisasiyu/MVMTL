excellent mix of everything - all your needs get met ... this cd is excellent . it 's a soulful mix of jazz , hip hop , and r & b . kajmere is a distribution company on the west coast turning out indiesoul , hip hop , dance , and indierock . they typically turn out 12 '' releases - most of these cuts are from these releases . and , this is exactly how this music sounds to me - underground , like hidden treasure - each track . from adriana evans ' `` remember the love '' , to n8e 's `` tread lightly '' and `` rock on '' , to all of dj tonks ' tracks , to presto and lowd 's `` back in 92 '' , to `` love '' by the globetroddas , this cd is an outstanding soulful representation of where i hope music continues to go . buy it - you wo n't be disappointed .
