i 'm surprised that this album is so underated . a lot of people prefer blue lines over protection and i just do n't understand that . i found protection to be great . possibly one of the best cds that massive attack has ever released other than mezzanine . eurochild is mindblowingly amazing . karmacoma , better things , heat miser , weather storm and spying glass are also exceptional . the only reason i do n't give this a 5 star rating is cause of the last track . a cover of the doors , light my fire that , to me , seems very pointless .
