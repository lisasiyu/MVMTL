ageless and beautiful music it 's hard for me to believe that nearly 10 years have passed since this album was released . maire brennan , lead vocalist of clannad , has a voice that is both ethereal and powerful at the same time . she has the ability to move me to tears even while singing in a language of which i have only minimal understanding ( irish gaelic ) . this particular album has several pieces that are quite beautiful and relaxing ... they would work nicely as lullabies . brennan 's skill as a harpist is also shown to great advantage on many tracks . not to be missed if you are an admirer of celtic new age music
