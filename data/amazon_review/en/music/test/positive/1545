better than original ... ever since i played final fantasy ix , i 've wanted to buy a soundtrack of it . i thought of buying the original soundtrack , but it cost more than $ 25 , and i did n't have that much money . so i decided on this cd and it was worth it . most of the songs on this cd are even better than the originals , and i was n't going to listen to most of the songs on the original so ... it 's worth every penny
