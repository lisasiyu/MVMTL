wow , that was dreamy . i am one of the few who believe that `` is n't anything '' is leagues better than `` loveless '' . this is one of my favorite albums ; therefore , it 's one of the few albums i 've actually purchased . `` is n't anything '' is n't really one of the most uplifting albums of all time , but it is undoubtedly original and i might even add , influencial . the lyrics are beautiful and heartfelt , the vocals are what really makes the album so dreamy . kevin shield 's voice is like a blur , and i do n't even know what a blur sounds like . `` no more sorry '' is what really made the album for me , personally , it just flows very well . this is n't really an album you 'd want to just listen to the drumsticks hit the drums and the pics hit the guitar , no , you should concentrate very hard on the lyrics . maybe , you 'll even pick up the messege 'my bloody valentine ' are trying to send across . of course though , that 's a different messege for everyone
