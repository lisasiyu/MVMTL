art rock genius ... an essential . when roxy music reunited in 2001 , they dipped into the bulk of this album , unfortunately , brian eno did n't take part in the shows . but in 1973 , they recorded an album so far ahead of its time that it still sounds futuristic today . the sax , synths and screaming guitars along with ferry 's haunting vocals make for creepy afterhours listening . those who are only familiar with roxy and bryan from the 80s on are going to be shocked when they hear this . those who love ziggy-era as well as the eno-fripp and eno-bowie collaborations will love it . those who have watched rocky horror can picture richard o'brien listening to this relentlessly . you can hear radiohead putting this one on as a point of reference for their more recent work ( thom yorke does a fairly decent ferry soundalike on the `` velvet goldmine '' soundtrack ) . you can hear tangerine dream , can and kraftwerk taking notes as well as goth pioneers like bauhaus and joy division cutting their teeth on this one , or bowie and peter gabriel seeing how `` the enemy '' is doing . another name that came to mind was director david lynch , who would work with eno on a `` dune '' track . you can picture bono and edge discussing the songs ... there are accessible songs like `` do the strand '' and `` editions of you '' , and then you have `` bogus man '' , `` in every dream home a heartache '' and `` for your pleasure '' which are as far out as you can get .
