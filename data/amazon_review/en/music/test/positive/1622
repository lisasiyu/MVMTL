primative blues there is something strange and primative about the beats laid down by kimbrough and his band . a view into what the blues may have sounded like 50 years ago , but amp'ed up . it 's tough to pull yourself away from this sound . liner notes by robert palmer are also great . if you are looking for soemthing different , but great , check out this album
