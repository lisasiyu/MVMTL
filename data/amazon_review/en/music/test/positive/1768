a very good soundtrack of a very cool movie ! as said in the title , strange days is one of the best movies ever and the soundtrack is really part of it . there is music through the whole film that is very important . it 's there to show the viewers all the different emotions the characters have . juliette lewis who is actually an actress sings a song called 'hardly wait'- it 's a metal song which is very angry and very cool . jeriko one- the black rapper who was shot in the movie and who actually the whole film 's about ( and who 's also just an actor ) appears with 'herewecome'- a rap song which tells the struggle and pain colored people had and still have to go through . it 's a very powerful song ! skunk anansie have two great metal songs like strange fruit who also appear with a metal song called 'no white clouds'- one of the coolest i 've ever heard ! the group prong made a metal cover of the door 's 'strange days ' which is respectful to the original and very cool . the dance song from peter gabriel and deep forest is great- just like sachel 's 'walk in freedom ' which is very beautyful . in short words ; - ) i love this album and i know you 'd like it too- it 's really worth to buy
