a little country , but still a rocker what a change for bob dylan . first he was a folk singer , than a hard rocker and now it seems he 'd turned direction , going a bit country . however , do n't make any mistake , just because he 's got country musicians , this is still a rocker and it 's one of my top five favorite dylan records . `` john wesley harding '' is sort of a western ballad that will have you stamping your feet . `` as i went out one morning '' is a country rocker with a message . so are many of the other songs on this record
