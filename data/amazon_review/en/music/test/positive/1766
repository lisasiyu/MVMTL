perhaps the finest blaxploitation soundtrack ever if you are at all impressed with mayfield 's superfly , give black caesar a listen . this album has it all- heavy hitting chunks of funk like down and out in new york city to the laid back pimpin ' sounds of blind man can see it . keep in mind that this album was released within months of the ground breaking big payback . buy this album , then buy slaughter 's big rip off . you wo n't be disappointed
