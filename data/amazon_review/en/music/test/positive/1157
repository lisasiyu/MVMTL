bo bice rocks ! he may not have won the title of american idol , but this country boy can rock ! vehicle is fantastic and in my opinion ( even though i voted for miss underwood to win the competition ) - bo sings 'inside your heaven ' a thousand times better than carrie . the price of this single is so minimal compared to the enjoyment true bo fans will get out of it . do n't pass it up
