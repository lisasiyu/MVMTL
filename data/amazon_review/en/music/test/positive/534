possibly the best experimental jazz record ever made ... .. there really is n't much you can say but totally unpredictable and absolutely ingenius from start to finish . one of those rare records that keeps you on the edge of your seat and you find yourself saying about every other minute `` how the hell did he think of that ? '' . the ideas are bountiful and over the top brilliant . every record collection should have at least one copy of can tago mago , captain beefheart trout mask replica and naked city by john zorn . amazing stuff
