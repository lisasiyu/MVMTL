relaxing night music david lanz has really turned me into a new age music listener and admirer with his graceful and soaring piano pieces . i 've never heard piano before that sounds like a living and breathing habitat , and since i 've been playing it myself from the age of six i had an even greater appreciation for his art . as a composer he is a genius but he 's just as brilliant as a performer . i can hear dark night sky and trees swaying in the wind , a bobbing brook running through a cool fir forest , a big cold orb of the silver moon shining on a grassy field and more through this music . nightfall is truly incredible and unforgettable and hearing it for the first time when i was around eleven , burned itself into my mind and i swear it has never left . i grew up listening to new age music and david lanz , michael jones , spencer brewer , nancy rumbel and eric tingstad just to name a few as their sweet melodies on piano , guitar flutes and other instruments wove a tapestry of sound and color like no other . this album might be short , but each piece brings quality that no quantity can beat and that makes it better than 2 cd sets of new age or any other music that i got in the past , filled with pieces but not all of them are to my taste . this album is sweet , dreamy , in places majestic and romantic and above all its filled with gorgeous melodies that make sense , and each one is a gem in my eyes . this has been in my collection for about thirteen years and i love it no matter much time passes between listening . i swear that listening to this really relaxes me , and right now as im typing , listening to it at work , i forget that im in a concrete jungle , and instead i feel like im sitting in a lighthouse with a fireplace burning ( no physically possible i know but still , its cute ) and i feel cozy and happy
