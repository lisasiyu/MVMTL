lunar powered i 'm only familiar w/ the soundtrack from the movie video so far but plan to get the cd . the soundtrack , especially the melodic , casual and deliberate & quot ; bright moon , & quot ; combined with the camera-work and choreography really did it for me . i got used to the higher pitch that the singer used almost immediately . this would make a great cd for the highway
