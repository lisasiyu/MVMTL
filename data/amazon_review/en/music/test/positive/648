grey gardens glistens grey gardens is well-written show , with a fine score . this album contains brilliant comic performances , as well as pathos . reminds us that the bouviers and the kennedys were quirky families , just like all of our own . the revolutionary costume for the day number at the top of act ii is utterly devestating , rendered by the brilliant christine ebersole , who plays mother in act 1 , and her own daughter in act ii
