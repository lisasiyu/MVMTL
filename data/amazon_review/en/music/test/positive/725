the purple genius three hours of perfect prince is hard to believe . here it is . all the grooves are present . all the funk . the indulgent boudoir ballads . the ambiguous spirituality . cameos of soul & gospel & rap . if you 've ever liked any prince song , then you 're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity . * of course there 's a reason this album is so overwhelming , both in terms of quantity and quality : it represents the best of five years of songwriting . allegedly in 1991 or so prince walked into the warner bros. offices and dumped five albums ' worth of music into their laps , thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations ' for the next five years . he then went home and continued to write songs . once 'emancipated ' from wb , free to form npg music , he released this treasure trove . without normal distribution , however , it `` only '' reached no.11 on the billboard album chart , and spawned only one single . crazy stuff . there 's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles . * there are dvds available of prince 's more recent lives shows , featuring consumate musicians , such as maceo parker and members of the family stone , but none more distinguished than prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent . music is his life . he can play virtually any instrument , sing , write , arrange ... dance . what 's more , he enjoys himself on stage - and it 's hard not to share in it all . the dvds are ideal complements to this cd set . * i think this is one of his best ever albums , and one of the best pop albums of all time . having heard almost all his work , this would be my desert island recording . i 've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is `` too good '' - there are at least twenty songs that could have been top 10 hits , and which beg to be treated as 'favourites ' - normally , i 'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here , that makes for a difficult choice - what 's more , since these songs have been starved of airplay they do n't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit , no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it 's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time . also , there 's no filler , nor is there a `` theme '' which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard ! it 's so good that it 's almost hard work !
