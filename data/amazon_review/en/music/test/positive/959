solid , though a litle monotonous at times ( 3.5 estrellas ) the songwriting on this album is really good , the level of musical ability of the band is high , and the hits are solid . the album comes out of the gate with a bang due to the single `` puedes contar conmigo '' . i think our local pop station here in atlanta has overplayed `` rosas '' , but it is a classic . amaia has a sweet and alluring voice , however a whole album of it will tire you out . this is not something you will want to listen to from beginning to end . i would suggest they let other band members sing 2 or 3 of the songs on their next album to break the monotony . amaia can sing and definitely should lead the singing ( plus she is a good songwriter ) , though . perhaps this is why julieta venegas ' albums are short - to keep her fans from tiring of her distinct , recognizable voice . this album proves why they are a supergroup with enormous popularity . its worth spending the money to buy the album , but one must strongly consider buying las canciones individuales if they are not a major fan
