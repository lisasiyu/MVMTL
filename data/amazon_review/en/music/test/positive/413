one of their best definitely their most commercial album and in that sense to most people probably their best . nothing will ever touch master of puppets in my opinion , but from beginnning to end this a top notch album without a single weak track . if you 're a diehard metal fan and never listen to anything else , you might want to avoid this one and stick with the pre-black albums . however , if you love a solid hard rock/metal album this is one of the handful that is a must own
