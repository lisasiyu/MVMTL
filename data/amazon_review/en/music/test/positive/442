catchy pop punk the huntingtons are the best band around today ... and this is their best release ! they bring a certain element of songwriting that no other band can duplicate.. they are funny lyrics but they also mean something unlike many other bands . the guitars stick in your head all day and it doesnt even bother you ! there should be 20 stars for high school roc
