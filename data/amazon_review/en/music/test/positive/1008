maybe the best debut of the 90's gangly garage-rock guitar riffs , breathy french-accented female vocals , catchy tunes with insightful lyrics that capture the exuberance as well a good measure of the angst of youth . & quot ; in the shadows & quot ; , & quot ; no guarantee & quot ; , & quot ; point of view & quot ; , & quot ; do n't believe a word & quot ; -- songs like these deserve better praise than i can possibly jot down here . you must listen for yourself ! one of the top cd 's of the 90 's , i think . their follow-up , & quot ; apartment life & quot ; , though very good , falls into a safer pop groove . i 'm looking for their third one to be the first great album of the new millenium
