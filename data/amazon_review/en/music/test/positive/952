excellent this album is probably mana 's finest work . this is basically the last album they did before they went overly pop-oriented . the album art is simple , just the band with their instruments . while other albums try to catch your eye with flashy cover art , this album may go unnoticed . however , there is n't a bad song on this disc , and it is worth every penny . the songs range from love songs , to songs about difficult life circumstances , and all the songs are sung with incredible raw emotion . the music is great , and it goes with the lyrics and voice perfectly . this is the album that shows everything mana is capable of . incredible
