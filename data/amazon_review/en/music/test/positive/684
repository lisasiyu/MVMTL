what a beautiful , rich cd i just stumbled on this cd by accident in a local music store , and what a wonderful find it was . every song is a gem , the songwriting is one beautiful image after another , and the music has such depth in its sparse , seemingly simple way . every listen just opens up more and more to me . i ca n't do the scholarly , professional music review , but i will say that this cd has sent me in a very short space of time to buy a copy of every other cd of his that i can find . my beginning acquaintance with those cds just reinforces my feelings about the animal years . this is music that just calls you to sit , be still and enjoy watching in your mind a thing of beauty unfold . in a much too hectic world , it 's a thing to treasure . now i 've just got to figure out how to make it to the coast to see one of his shows .
