a timeless and smooth new order album of all the new order albums that i own , i would have to say that republic has been my favorite throughout the years . i enjoy listening to this album the whole way through , and with the order that they used to lay out the songs , you can have it on repeat and want to listen to it again and again . so you can understand my interpretation of the feel of the album and why i like it , i will tell you that i enjoy this album because of the musical style it has , which in my opinion , has a timeless and smooth quality to it . each song starts out brilliantly , and although it would go well on a pop radio station , it seems a little more mature and unique than your typical pop tune , using a fine combination of guitars , keyboards , and at times , a choir and a symphony . to describe the feel of each song , as each song progresses , you become more settled as the rythm and the background ( almost a classical style-like music ) resonates and blends with the guitars and keyboards even more as the song reaches it 's climax . bernard sumner 's vocals seemed to be most at home with this style . with coldplay , dido , sarah mclachlan , delerium , balligomingo , and many others in my most frequently listened to category , this one definitely goes well in the mix ... the mix for chillin . :
