alan jackson precious memories cd the is a wonderful collection of hymns . alan should do more acoustic work . glad his mother was finally able to get him to cut the cd . sang most of the songs while growing up in el paso . already liked alan but this collection of songs shows he is blessed with talent . have bought 2 of these to share with family members . my aunt who just turned 99 , thought it was great .
