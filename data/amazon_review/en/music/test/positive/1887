fun album of mostly new material this is probably the best of the spongebob cd 's released to date . it has a cute radio-station theme that is woven in between the songs . though the first few songs are just repeats of previous albums , there are a number of great new songs . so the cd is worth the money . parents be aware that there are two songs that deal with `` mature '' subjects in a childish way ( dealing with underwear and saying bad words ) . overall a fun album
