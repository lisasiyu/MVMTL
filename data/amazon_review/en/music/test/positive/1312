have a nice day ; volume 5 i noticed it 's been over two years since this volume has had a new review but that is understandable considering the age of this music however it is still fun to hear this material again and during the late 60s and most of the 70s i listened to music on the radio more than i have my entire life and that is the reason these earlier volumes of the h.a.n.d . series bring back so many pleasant memories for me . wls , waky , & wklo were my favorite 60s & 70s am radio stations and they played most of these songs regularly when these tunes were on the charts and it 's nice to still be able to listen to them in this new century . does nostalgia play a role for me ? ... ..definitely ! ... ..and even though this volume 5 is evidently out of print ; it is still a good one . as a matter of fact ; i think it is one of the best of this series of 25 being below only volumes 1 & 2 . a few previous reviewers have spoke highly of it and a few have spoke of it as being one of the weaker ones ; then again ( as i 've said before ) it all depends on your taste for these old songs and there are several tunes on this volume that suits my taste . two of them are daddy dewdrop 's , chick-a-boom ( do n't ya jes ' love it ) , and jerry reed 's crossover hit , when you 're hot , you 're hot . both are very upbeat & halarious . one of my favorite 70s bands was hamilton , joe frank and reynolds and they are also here with , do n't pull your love . murray head 's , superstar , is a tune i had n't heard in 30 + years and sounds great and chase 's , get it on , ( not to be confused with t.rex 's , bang a gong ; get it on ) is a fantastic rocker . although i like the beatles abbey road version better ; richie havens version of , here comes the sun , also brings back fond memories . another talented artist on this volume is lobo singing one of his big hits being , me and you and a dog named boo . mike curb congregation 's , burning bridges , is a good tune i probably have n't heard since it dropped off the charts back then . 60s legends ; tommy james , and the raiders are also here with their huge hits ; the top 10 , draggin ' the line , and the # 1 smash , indian reservation , ( in that order ) and speaking of 60s legends ... ..the fortunes are also here with the stellar , here comes that rainy day feeling again , and that song is the standout on this disc ... ..whew ! ... ..volume 5 ; a weaker version ? ... ..not to me ! this is an out of print ( but strong ) volume . have a nice day ; volume 5 = 4 1/2 stars
