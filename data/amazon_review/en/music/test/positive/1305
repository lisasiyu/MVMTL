the best bright eyes cd yet from track one to thirteen i found they we where all great . i picked up on a lot of new york influences in the writing of the lyrics . man this cd is great i got it last wednesday took a drive and have n't stopped listening to it , and now i ca n't wait to see him next tuesday , rather them . if you are a bright eyes fan , or have just started listening to them , or have n't heard them at all this will either a : want you to get more of his stuff or b : just listen to the cd over and over it is that good . he really brought it together with just great writing , great formations of the songs , and just overall chills when i listen to it . i know all of his albums are personal , but this one is just great .
