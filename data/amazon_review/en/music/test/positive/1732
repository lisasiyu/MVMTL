not quite the ultimate chill out but still good i guess after hearing the fifth volume in the buddha bar series , my expectations of chill out compilations have been raised . i have been spoiled by the diversity of the well-knowned chill out series . so when i bought nettwerk 's & quot ; chillout 2003 : the ultimate chillout & quot ; , i thought it could have been better and less predictable . as much as i love moby and his song & quot ; in this world & quot ; and sasha 's & quot ; wavy gravy & quot ; , i thought those two songs could have easily been left off this cd . on the other hand hearing a new song from & quot ; delerium ( & quot ; love & quot ; ) and a remix of my favorite conjure one song & quot ; tears from the moon & quot ; made it well worth buying the cd , which i found a used copy in the used bins at my favorite record store . the delerium song & quot ; love & quot ; was nothing i have ever heard before from my favorite ambient act . faithless ' zoe johnston lends her stunning vocals to the beautiful song . i also loved kirsty hawkshaw 's & quot ; fine day [ frakker mix ] & quot ; . i remember hearing samples of that song on an old orbital song . of course what is a nettwerk compilation without a sarah mclachlan track ? to be honest , i actually enjoyed the william orbit mix of & quot ; black & quot ; . i am nowhere tired of that song as i am with delerium 's & quot ; silence & quot ; . i was n't too wild about the telepopmusik or fischerspooner tracks . both groups i find vastly overrated . i loved ihb 's & quot ; olivia newton christ & quot ; and fc kahuna 's & quot ; north pole transmission & quot ; . hooligan 's & quot ; hear me now & quot ; and new order 's & quot ; your silent face & quot ; . with all its imperfections , & quot ; chillout 2003 & quot ; is quite good but it is n't the ultimate chill out as the title say . i leave that title to my favorite chill out compilation & quot ; buddha bar v & quot ;
