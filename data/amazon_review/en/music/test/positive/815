fantastic album from the most underrated rock group ever ! every track from this rich , warm lp blows you away . everything from pete ham 's and george harrison 's slide guitars on `` day after day '' to ham 's hauntingly aching `` take it all . '' every rock and pop fan should pick this cd up before it slips out of print . badfinger initially were on the beatles ' apple records label before they moved to warner brothers in 1973/74 . every album recorded by this incredibly gifted band is worth it - `` magic christian music , '' `` no dice '' ( which ties with `` straight up '' as the best lp , `` ass , '' `` badfinger , '' `` wish you were here '' and `` head first . '' any fan of the beatles , the who , hendrix , cream/clapton and everyone else from the late 1960s/early 1970s should pick up badfinger 's discs . this was the band that rolling stone magazine said , in 1970 , is the group `` to watch for '' in the coming years . it 's a shame their manager , s. polly , was such a thief and robbed the band of royalties and potential fame , which concluded with ham 's suicide in 1975 and bassist tom evans ' suicide in 1983 . drummer mike gibbons , sadly , passed away late last year , leaving only guitarist-vocalist joey molland as the band 's sole survivor . rest in peace guys ! p.s . do n't be turned off by the beatles comparisons - badfinger had a sound , song structures and style all to their own , which will please both fans of the beatles and those who do n't care for the fab four . power pop-rock was never better than the early 1970s records from badfinger . ( actually , badfinger 's output was as good as most of the solo beatles work in the early 1970s .
