magnificent ! ! ! bravo horowitz ! ! i remember hearing all about this concert in moscow when i was a kid . whatever i thought - so some old guy played in mosocw . well , reader you must forgive me for my stupidity , because for some time i realize the greatness of maestro horowitz , and the importance of his playing in moscow , his hometown and homeland after 60 years . i bought this album because i remember the hoopla in 1986 . i was not dissapointed . the playing is emotional and incredible . horowitz really was an amazing piano player - the ability to hold rapture over the audience is captured here . those fingers -connected to a difficult , sole-eating , slight , russian man - were magic . wow . those beautiful notes he plays hold in the air like ripe fruit . a master at work ! this was an inspired performance by a magician on the ivories . if your wondering what the fuss was about , or you want a cd that expresses how classical music can move the soul - then i recommend this cd very highly . along with the three tenors in concert , it just has some inherent quality to move you . horowitz may have made better studio recordings , and better live recordings , but i am convinced this is just a good . i join along with the gentleman who can be heard yelling `` bravo '' at the conclusion of several pieces . bravo !
