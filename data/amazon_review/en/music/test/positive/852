vintage rodney & quot ; what 's in a name & quot ; is a perfect taste of rodney 's early years in the nightclub scene . you can even hear glasses hitting glasses and other various club noises in the background . he 's a little toned down , but you still get tons of his trademark & quot ; i do n't get no respect & quot ; jokes . if you want to hear some of rodney 's greatest jokes before they were really famous and you do n't want to spend a lot of money , this is the cd for you . i 'm really happy my friend , kevin mccarthy bought it for me
