excellent children 's intro to spanish this is a standard play in our home . my kids love the way the character 's repeat each spanish sentence after luis , bob , maria and the muppets . the songs are catchy and infectious . we love to listen to this one in the afternoon , and after a lively session of sing along and dancing , it 's off for naptime ! buy the video too , it 's fun and festive and will give your little ones a taste of spanish culture . a must have for every elmo and sesame street fan
