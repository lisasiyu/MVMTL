excellent , legendary show except for donna the screech owl i remember taping this one from the radio on the night that it happened . the keith & donna years were a high point for the dead , but i never really embraced the donna part of the deal . here 's my challenge to you : listen to `` playing in the band , '' and when you get to the point where donna lets out that prolonged , off-key screech , let me know how that works for you . donna , in my opinion , was this band 's yoko , except for the fact that yoko was a better singer . she sort of wandered back and forth across the stage in her white hospital gown and at inappropriate moments let out howls and moans tuneless bursts of god-knows-what-she-was-thinking . dead heads have all kinds of reasons why she was a wonderful addition to the band , and i never understood or agreed with any of them . that said , it 's a classic and solid set from the band , including wharf rat , help on the way , slipknot , morning dew and many standards from the 70s era dead shows . without donna , this would be an easy 5-star performance .
