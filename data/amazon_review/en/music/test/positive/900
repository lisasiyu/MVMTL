geek rock there have n't really been many acts these past few years that really have been more about image than the feeling or uniqueness of great pop music . one of the most surprising acts these past few years is definitely weezer . they have really brought up a great deal with the feel of geek rock , and their latest single really does connect with everybody . their latest track beverly hills is a great pop song . it is very upbeat and easily catchy . i like this song because it is very different and very vivid . rivers cuomo and company have really got a lot into good music right now . hopefully , they can keep it up with their next single . song : b 1/2+
