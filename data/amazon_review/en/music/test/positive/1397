breathe deep - this `` smoke '' is good for the soul lucky thompson was a strange one - a fighter , a questioner , a perfectionist , a complainer , a self-proclaimed victim of musical exploitation by what he called `` vultures '' - who dropped from the scene sometime in the mid-late 70s , gave his horns away to pay off debts , and never had anything to do with music again . he died a homeless recluse in seattle in july 2005 . oh yeah , he was also one of the greatest tenor saxophonists ever to play jazz . this 1964 quartet date finds lucky in the company of a very supportive rhythm section . the lyrical and fleet hank jones on piano is a handsome foil for the equally fleet and lyrical thompson . on half the tunes lucky plays soprano ; mid-nite oil and prey loot , both lucky compositions , are good soprano tracks . lucky 's writing has always been attractive . on tenor , fly with the wind and reminiscent , again tunes written by thompson , are the highlights . connie kay 's drumming , so light and tasty , is a treat throughout the proceedings . this album is definitely worth checking out
