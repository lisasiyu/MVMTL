romance is still alive in shall we dance cd and dvd i watch this movie over and over . the story is wonderful , the acting is great -- who can resist richard gere 's tiny smile towards his wife , susan sarandon . and this was my first intro to jennifer lopez who was excellent and a wonderful dancer . the music ? ? well , i had to have the music ; it is varied and it is romantic and uplifting and introduced me to peter gabriel and other music . you wo n't be sorry to buy this music -- it makes you want to get up and dance slow and fast ! ! and if you are a little bit of an oldster , like me , it will bring back youthful and memorable feelings of romance and real love
