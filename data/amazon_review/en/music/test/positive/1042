once again , bell delivers i 'll have to admit i steered a bit clear of joshua bell in the early years of his career . my aversion was n't based on his musical abilities . he was one of the performers that a few music industry publicity people decided would appeal to a younger audience so he was dressed as a teenaged heart throb that seemed to belong on the cover of a magazine geared toward junior high school girls than a lover of good , serious music . i think i resented shameless attempts to lure a `` younger crowd '' into concert halls to hear a symphony . i was young at the time and it did n't matter to me whether the guy on the cover was wearing a tux and might be a bit overweight or if he looked like the kid next door or the woman was slightly flawed wearing a gown or if she looked like a sex symbol . all i cared about was the music and i responded by not purchasing any of the various wunderkind releases and joshua bell was in this category . of course i could boycott the recordings but i could n't ignore the likes of joshua bell . he was always on television , performing with symphony orchestras ( classical music radio stations still broadcast a plethora of concerts at the time ) and i think only the most closed minded listeners could deny his talent . since that time i 've seen him perform and what i 've found is an amiable performer with great talent who knows people that while people are paying to hear him play , the performance has to be about the music and not the performer and even if he has n't aged , at least according to the cover photos on his recordings , he has matured as a performer . his technique is still evolving which could one day earn him a place with some of the great violinists ( remember he 's only in his thirties , he still has quite a career ahead of him ) , and he 's able to perform some of the works of the greet classical composers and pieces with popular appeal without getting gimmicky . voice of the violin is a collection of vocal pieces arranged fop the violin . each of the arrangements works well for violin . the challenge is performing them with the same passion we are used to when we hear them performed by vocalists . just about every tenor and soprano of note has performed and recorded schubert 's `` ave maria . '' massenet 's `` porquoi me reveller '' from werther is a showstopper that was a favorite of tenors from caruso to pavarotti . fans of fredericka von stade and renee fleming have grown to love `` song to the moon '' from rusalka . we 've grown accustomed to the greats singing many of the works on this collection with beauty and gusto . chances are expectations are high for anyone familiar with these works . bell delivers . he evokes the emotions of each piece and in a way his violin does sing as he performs . this can be tricky . so often vocal works , especially those from the operatic stage , do n't adapt all that well to instrumental transcriptions and it is the rare instrumental performer that can do justice to the works , but joshua bell seems to in this recording . fans of joshua bell do not need to be convinced of the merits of this recording . some may feel this is not a serious enough recording but i think most people who enjoy good music will appreciate bell 's artistry and the beautiful melodies are sure to give listeners hours of pleasure .
