whitechocolatespaceegg allows pahir to develop wcse is perhaps liz 's most mature record both song writing & musically ... .the title track is both erie & sad , & i think the standout track is `` what makes you happy '' which is very upbeat & almost dancable ! this is a great record if you like good songwriting & great structure to your pop/rock music
