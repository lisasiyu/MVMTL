a fantastic listen for the open-minded fan with engines of creation , joe satriani did what he has always done : make the most of the tools he chooses to use . only this time , he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar . it would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote `` satch boogie , '' `` war '' and `` flying in a blue dream '' went . well , he 's still here , only more than ever he 's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey . i 've never heard robots having sex , but i 'm willing to be `` borg sex '' is n't far off . and although his calmly passing , sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure , that 's kinda how you 'd expect to see `` clouds race across the sky . '' the 'chorus ' to `` devil 's slide '' sounds as sinister as its name suggests and `` attack '' is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as i 've ever heard . to top it off , the album includes `` until we say goodbye , '' one of satch 's best ballads in his entire catalogue . if you 're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off surfing with the alien-style , you 'll find that there 's an incredible amount of depth -- and musicianship -- to be found . it 's not a satriani masterpiece , but its a true testament to the man 's enduring creativity
