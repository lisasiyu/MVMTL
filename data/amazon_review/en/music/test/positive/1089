back when the music was real this cd takes me back a lot even though i had previously never heard it before . i instantly started to compare it with other groups like trixter and warrant . i so love the fact that i can explore music on amazon that i would otherwise not be aware of . this group should have been a lot more successful and well known but however they brought out this album at a bad time for rock when things were turning to grunge music and nirvana
