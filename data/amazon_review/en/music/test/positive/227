50 times and counting ... i have owned this cd since the day it came out and i have not stopped listening to it . i like all rap and hip-hop for the most part . i love lyric , social driven rap like the roots and talib kweli and mos def , but i also have no problem throwing crunk club ish in the deck like three six mafia or lil ' jon . that said , this album completely blows me away and it seriously pains me that obie trice is so slept on . this album is better than second round 's on me , most likely because he had more help from em on this one truthfully , but still , both cds are great . i just wanted to write this review to do something to try to spread the word . this cd is unbelievable . my three favorite rap cds of all time are the notorious big- life after death , eminem- the eminem show , & obie trice- cheers . i love the female-problem-driven songs on here like lady , hands on me , & even do n't come down about his mama . the lyrics are unreal and his style is unprecedented and fresh . he is creative , witty , and his flow is downright cold , not to mention production is superb . please buy this cd
