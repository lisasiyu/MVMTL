great music if you can tolerate the religious songs some excellent pickin ' and a wide variety of styles make this a record that people who do n't normally like that twangy , twangy country sound will find quite rocking . unfortunately there is a lot of religious content which some might find objectionable-should there be a warning label on the cover ? i find that if you just think they are saying `` cheeses '' every time someone says jesus it is much less objectionable
