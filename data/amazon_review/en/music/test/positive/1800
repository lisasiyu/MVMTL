wow ! ( for the most part , anyway ) having had the pleasure of seeing mr. haynes live and on disc in several different contexts , both as leader and sideman , i have developed quite a love for his music over the years . he has the unique ability to push the music to new heights while not drowning out the contribution of his fellow musicians . so natuarally i was looking forward to this release.i was not disappointed.danilo perez , who brings a wonderful , unique latin flavor to his playing , seems to be genuinely at ease with the music while still being quite creative . plus , he is just very fun to listen to ! john patitucci is a bass player whos career i have been following ever since his days in the group tamarac . his stint with chick corea , though , really brought attention to his very solid playing.mr . haynes , of course is electrifying . playing rhythems and counter rhythems which would cause most other drummers nightmares , are totally second nature to him . after all , he has been doing this for over fifty years.in the end , though , all this great talent would mean nothing without good tunes for them to create on . on this cd that means a selection of tried and true standards , with a few more recent works added in for good measure.the first half of the album consists of studio recordings while the second deals with live cuts from a stint at scullers.personaly , i prefer the live tunes . the band has a tendency to cut loose a lttle more and take a few more chances . this , as is often the case , brings the excitment level up a few notches.all in all , you ca n't really go wrong with this cd . do yourself a favor : pick this one up , pour yourself a cup of coffee , and prepare to be delighted
