pete rock & cl smooth this is a very enjoyable hip-hop album that was a breath of fresh air when it sppeared . although it lacks a super-duper classic tune , it is strong on 90 percent of the songs . the only problem for the artists who recorded the album is , it is so good , there is n't anything else to say at the end . how can pete rock and cl smooth do any better ? this is their 'invisible man ' so it did not shock me that they did not record much after the release of this gem . cl smooth appears to improvise at times on this album and does n't sound rehearsed ( much rap does ) . pete rock 's beats are superb . do n't waste your money on sex rap or crime rap ; get this one , and learn
