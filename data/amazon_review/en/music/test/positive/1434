wired rules ! this is my fav for guitar instrumentals.what i love about beck is that he is about tone and not about speed.most people think the faster your solos are the better , not true at all.beck has amazing melody and tone and is very technical and his leads and solos are amazing.a great album by my favorite guitarist . beck is very underated.he can play as good as any of the greats.he buries clapton , page.i would say hendrix and beck are the 2 best guitar players.both have great tone and similar styles
