great blues rock , good voice i had this album on my shelf for years ( along with modernday folklore ) and i just broke them out again ; i forgot how good they are . i ca n't stop playing them right now . he really knows how to break it up by picking up the pace and slowing it down . i bought if for `` blue sky '' which was played on the radio at the time but the others are great , too . `` harlem '' is your socially conscious rock tune , but one great piece of music
