jesse in ca unbelievable songwriting ! how could tjw go relatively unnoticed as he has been in the music industry ? i just saw him in los angeles last week in a smaller venue and he tore the roof off the place ! ! ! just him , his stratocaster & harmonica and a drummer . with the pa system set up right he sounded like a 5-piece band with just the 2 of them ! one hot july is probably his best effort to date in my opinion and now i 'm currently in the process of purchasing everything he 's ever put out ! ! ! buy this album and experience some of the best music ever produced
