asdf lo fi , futuristic production and real raw lyrics about slangin white abound in this release , which suprisingly happens to contain just as much style as it does substance in a lyrically taboo zone which encompasses such retards as young jeezy and rick ross ... these two do it well and are two of the more superior mainstream emcees in the game today ... the production is also different and fresh ... listen and weep..
