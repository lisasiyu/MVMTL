some of the best albert king stuff agreed - this is some of the best songs i heard albert play on record . truly an excellent collection . you 'll hear not only albert 's awesome soulful singing but also a lot of intense blues guitar , which is truly `` king '' . the sound quality leaves more to be desired , but it is acceptable . material more than makes up for it . i played this record to someone who 's never heard albert king 's material before and they were shocked . i 'm a fan of albert king , and this is a valuable disc in my collection
