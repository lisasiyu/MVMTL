it takes a while ... i grew up on dylan ... in fact , dylan is my middle name . i was very intimate with his songs from a very early age . when i bought this album in the early '90s , i was still in high school . at first , i remember thinking that his voice was gone . i did n't think i could listen to the entire album . i struggled through it and put it on a shelf . from time to time , i forced myself to listen to it . i do n't know exactly when the change took place ... i suppose i grew up a bit , musically . good as i been to you started to take shape . the guitar ... the harp ... the voice . all of a sudden , it meant something entirely different . it made sense . it all came together . now , fourteen years later , i listen to this album at least once a week . i will not hesitate to say that this is a great album . but , for some reason , it needs to grow on you . it builds up to some subtle crescendo . then , suddenly , it will hit you like a ton of bricks . dylan knew exactly what he was doing . this is his re-entry into greatness after a few years astray . the guitar picking is incredible . his voice could n't be more appropriate for the content . if you need more proof , just look at what the ( rare ) vinyl form of this album can fetch . i recently acquired the lp , and it is the most expensive one in my collection ! those 'in the know ' really know what this album is worth . give it a try ... then try it again . let the guitar flow through you for a while . sing along . go ahead and try . it 's not that easy . you 'll soom see why this is one of dylan 's greatest albums . i say that as a hard-core dylan fan , so do n't take it lightly
