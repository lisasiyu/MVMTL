neu ! - 'neu ! '75 ' ( astralwerks ) rother and dinger parted ways for a couple of years before putting out the duo 's third release. & quot ; heros & quot ; sounds , to me like what may 've influenced gary numan 's early work. & quot ; e-musik & quot ; is a seven minute , nice hypnotic/floating track.as & quot ; after eight & quot ; progresses with it 's laid back piano and mystic like vocals more than prove that neu ! really was ahead of their time , so does & quot ; see land & quot ; . & quot ; isi & quot ; could become a hit , if played in the right clubs.dug the punk-like vocals.i always thought that that neu ! was strictly instrumental. & quot ; leb wohl & quot ; is an offbeat experimental piece that starts out with weird , but very cool sound effects , then turns into a punk song.pretty much as mind blowing as neu ! 's first album.according to the liner notes , rother plays guitar , piano , synth and electronics..dinger provides the percussion , guitar , organ , vocals and keyboards.never has one heard so much brain damaging pleasure coming from just two musicians
