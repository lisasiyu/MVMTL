what is going on ? ok , i 'm getting sick of seeing people that do n't understand why mark collie 's `` in time '' is on this cd . let me educate you all ... unlike spiderman or the rest of the marvel characters , the punisher is human . in time he will die ... all it will take is a bullet . if you sit down and listen to the words of `` in time '' you 'll see this . maybe its just me , but i 'd rather listen to `` johnny cash 's evil tiwn '' than yet another creed rip off or a `` i 'm pissed at the world '' song
