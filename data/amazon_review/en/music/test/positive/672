look what the cat dragged in with sixteen songs , the first impression is that there 's got to be a lot of filler here . the good news is there 's nothing but perfect rolling stones songs - one after another . the stones jump around from the pondering bluesy , `` laugh , i nearly died '' to the hard paced , `` driving too fast '' and `` rain fall down '' . some of the fun pops up with the blatantly political , `` sweet neo con '' and the scathing , `` look what the cat dragged in '' . it 's all new , fresh and lively as hell . producer don was does a fantastic job getting the stones to produce what is arguably their best album in over two decades . rock on
