voices in the room nice jazz sampler should appeal to most tastes in mainstream jazz since it 's not too funky or free-style . what 's the real kicker here is the sacd quality . certainly not what i would call a great test cd but still good for amazing friends with the detailed sonics and tight bass lines and realistic voices in the room effects .
