a good album is a good album thanks for the background on this movie 's soundtrack mr. davids , and it 's great to know you support native american musicians . but to give this album one star out of five just because lisa gerrard is n't native american is ridiculous , and frankly , racist . peter gabriel 's `` long walk home : music from the rabbit-proof fence '' was a similarly haunting , ethereal collection of songs . the movie focused on the aboriginal peoples of australia . think anyone cared that peter gabriel is n't an aborigine ? like gabriel , gerrard has worked with musicians of several ethnic origins , and has always made efforts to support and promote them . this in turn increases cultural awareness of marginalized ethnicities for the mainstream consciousness , and represents one of the fundamental altruistic forces in what has been blanket-termed `` world music . '' we should applaud musicians like gerrard , not castigate them . or , the very least , we should judge music by the talent of the composer , not by that composer 's ethnicity . -amahl turczyn scheppach , music lover . ethnic origin : white/other
