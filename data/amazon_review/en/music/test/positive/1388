debut of the most overlooked rock group ever ( 5 stars ) supergrass ' i should coco is a landmark acheivement . the thought that mere teenagers could recreate an energy not felt since the birth of punk in the late 70s is astounding . supergrass deliver great track after great track almost through the entire album , each one filled with a youthful energy and an appropriate goofiness that is so lacking in the world of music . the frontman of the band , gaz coombs , has written enough infectious songs on this one effort alone to qualify him as one of the great pop writers of all time . only during maybe one or two tracks does the album slow a bit . it effects the final result of the album but it does n't kill it ( the slow tracks are just as good as the rest ) . it 's amazing to think how short-lived supergrass ' fame was when listening to this fine album and one can only hope that these unsung artists will rise to the top once more
