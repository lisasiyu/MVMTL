journey of a gemini -- this cd is wonderful ! ! ! this is my first donell jones ' cd , and i can truly say this is by far perhaps the best cd i 've heard in several years by any artist . the tracks from start to finish are great , and i found myself listening to the cd all day the first time i played it . what prompted me to buy the cd was the song i 'm gon na be which i hear more on my satellite radio stations than i have locally here in michigan . and because of the quality of music , i very rarely buy cd 's anymore , however , after hearing i 'm gon na be , i was telling a friend how much i liked that song and my friend happened to have the cd and only after listening to maybe 3 or 4 other tracks , i knew i would n't be disappointed . i love this cd - great job , donell ! ! ! what i am disappointed in is the lack of promotion for this cd . it just burns me up when there are some non-mainstream artists with a great product and for whatever ( dumb ) reason , the marketing depts . of the record companies that do n't actively promote artists such as donell jones who have quality products . there is n't even a video out , which in this day and age , an artist must have a video to further promote their product ( s ) . so shame on jive records ( and all the other record companies ) who do n't actively and aggressively promote cd 's with the quality that this one exhibits . i recommend this cd to anyone who can appreciate good quality r & b - both youngheads and oldheads ( i 'm an old head in my mid-40 's ) . i have been doing my own promotion for this cd and will contact my local radio stations to ask that they include i 'm gon na be in their rotation .
