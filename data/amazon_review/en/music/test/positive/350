i had no idea i 'd love bruce ... i was never a big fan of bruce springsteen growing up - i was a `` tweener '' when `` born in the usa '' came out and for some reason his music just never appealed to me . however , this album is so different from his other stuff i 've heard ( which i completely admit is limited experience ) and more like the music i typically like - folksy , bluesy , a bit of bluegrass , just so many things you can not put it into a box . love it
