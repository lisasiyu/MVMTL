a work of art . masterpiece . what an album . easily one of my favorites . it 's one that deserves to be listened to on a high end music system . i have my albums that i like on my ipod , or in the car . this is one i like to dedicate my time to without distractions . bought it the day it came out and has only gotten better with time . my musical tastes usually fall within the electronic/downbeat domain ( air , boards of canada , herbert , fila brazilla , autechre..etc ) i do own listen without prejudice , but older is a much more sophisticated , well rounded album . mr. michael 's vocals are smooth and lush . first review i 've ever done on amazon , could n't have picked a better album to start with .
