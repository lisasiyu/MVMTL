very live dead the old bromide said it all ... on a good night , there really was `` nothing like a grateful dead concert , '' and that held true for both their acoustic and electric sets . reckoning captures some of the best moments of their 1980 radio city music hall and san francisco acoustic sets , and they 've put several winners on here . `` china doll , '' `` to lay me down , '' `` bird song , '' `` cassidy '' and `` ripple '' are particularly outstanding , but except for a somewhat dirge-like `` it must have been the roses '' ( c'mon , jerry , pick up the tempo ! ) , everything here shows these ol ' reliables at their unplugged best . what else is there to say ? the grateful dead may be gone , but the music is as present -- -and as timeless -- -as ever . some of the best of it can be found here
