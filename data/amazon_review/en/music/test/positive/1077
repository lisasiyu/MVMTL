very nice ! i have been listening to this album for two christmas seasons and never seem to tire of it . the instrumental pieces are very well done , beautifully providing delicate , intricate harmonies . the vocal numbers are equally well done . there is a nice selection of songs , some familiar to the modern listener , and some providing a good introduction to medieval music . this is christmas music for all ages
