splendid i 've never heard such delicate and beautiful playing of bach 's well tempered clavier such as this . schiff coaxes the most incredibly sweet sounds out of his piano and gives these works a new dimension . some of the tempi in the fugues are slower than those of gould 's survey , as indicated by the reviewer below , but his phrasing is so flowing and smooth that it becomes more hypnotic and the listener becomes entranced by it . add to the fact that the sound is remarkably full with just the right amount of resonance without compromising clarity ( compared to gould 's discs which offer impressive crispness but is rather dry in tone ) this set is satisfying in every way
