a classic rock album brought down by poor sound quality the band : ian gillan ( vocals ) , ritchie blackmore ( guitar ) , jon lord ( keyboards ) , roger glover ( bass ) , ian paice ( drums & percussion ) . the disc : ( 1970 ) originally 8 tracks long clocking in at approximately 47 minutes . this digitally remastered ( uk ) version released in 1995 adds 12 bonus tracks bringing the total listen to just over 78 minutes . this is the band 's 4th album . included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/time/credits , numerous photos ( some unreleased ) ; a brief insight to the making of and happenings during the time the album was made - by roger glover and ( writer ) simon robinson ( with quotes from gillan and lord as well ) ; and the discography of `` in rock '' in various countries . label - emi records . comments : after purchasing the `` machine head '' and `` fireball '' deluxe anniversary packages ... i could n't wait to get my mitts on `` deep purple in rock '' . every song is a fast paced rocker here with the exception of the ten minute `` child in time '' - one of my favorite slow rockers ... and one of gillan 's many highlights vocally , as well as lord 's wonderful slow intro and blackmore 's guitar solo once the song picks up . for some reason , i was thinking roger glover cold fix the original tapes and make these songs sound like they were recorded last year . not so . the sound is still as muddy as ever . in many places , ian paice 's cymbals & hi-hat are non-existent . lord 's organ/keyboards are mixed so poorly at times it 's tough to distinguish between his high notes and blackmore 's high notes . disappointing to say the least - it still sounds like a.m. radio . i grew up with deep purple and i have 17 of the discs . `` in rock '' was easily not my favorite , but it was definitely top 5 due to great songs like `` black night '' , `` speed king '' , `` flight of the rat '' and `` child in time '' ( check out the live version of this song on `` made in japan '' ... i 'll go out on a limb and claim it 's better than the studio version here ) . `` black night '' and `` speed king '' made it to most of their greatest hits compilations , while `` child in time '' made it to a few . the bonus tracks are a plus . though the sleeve will have you salivating at `` 12 '' bonus tracks , it 's really only `` 6 '' . the other `` 6 '' are intro 's to each song lasting on average 20-30 seconds each . various chit-chat and blackmore fooling around on his guitar . these 6 bonus songs sound great ... slightly different , and much improved sound over the original 8 tracks . 2 of the tracks are unreleased - `` jam stew '' and `` cry free '' ... both treats ! two bonus versions of `` speed king '' , and an unedited remix of `` black night '' are the highlights . in my opinion , the back photo is very telling ... glover is front and center and the backbone of the band - perhaps the glue keeping the 5 members together ( knowing how blackmore and gillan got along ) . for me , this is a very good album , but the poor sound quality keeps me from rating it any higher . the lone track `` child in time '' and the bonus songs make this a must-have disc
