ahhhhhhhh refreshing like crackin open a cold beer . this is hip hop ya 'll . this what needs to be on the airwaves . this whole album is listenable . no poppy fluff here . just a dope mc paintin pictures with words and not videos . how dudes like joc d4l and franchize boys sell records is still beyond me . support real hip hop and buy this . you wont regret it
