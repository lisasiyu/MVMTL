stirring and hauntingly beautiful those of you who are n't familiar with ofra haza , i encourage you to please listen to this beautiful woman 's albums . `` kirya '' is definitely a wonderful example of the legacy haza left , when she passed away in 2000 . although some call her the `` madonna of the middle east , '' in my opinion i think she is far more talented , prolific and outstanding . for starters , ofra haza was devoutly religious , as a yemenite jew , from israel , had a clean sound , put ancient poetry to music , and used her voice as an instrument for peace and liberation . that is where she and madonna vear off quite differently from one another . `` kirya '' presents a beautiful cross-section of songs and experiences . we hear her sing in english , arameic and hebrew . the songs are about sadness , mortality and love . some great , outstanding examples on this album include : `` trains of no return '' ( about the effects of the holocaust and the trains heading to auschwitz and dachau , amongst many other concentration camps , where jews were systematically executed ) , `` daw da hiya , '' ( about the consequences of a young woman 's premarital affair with her lover ) , and `` do n't forsake me '' ( about old age ) . this is a treasure of an album . buy it today ... ..let the legacy of ofra haza remain for many , many years to come . what an inspirational and beautiful woman ... ...
