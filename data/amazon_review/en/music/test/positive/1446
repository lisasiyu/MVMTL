more trio kurt ! what a record ! this is my favorite recording and context for his playing ( and i have heard all he 's recorded for the public ) . so very very good : i just got it yesterday and i ca n't take it off . the title cut ( which [ is it just me ? ] rings of goodbye pork pie hat ) , is alone worth whatever price you have to pay . hats off to jorge rossy too ( as always ) . seriously , i hope he explores the trio setting again and again in what is sure to be a long career . it is so rare these days to hear a voice like this , where you know instantly that you 're hearing a guy in for the long haul ! beautiful
