perhaps their best ? i was fortunate enough to be at the cd release concert for this album last night at the birchmere in alexandria , va last night , efo 's home turf . they performed pretty much all the songs on the cd ( only leaving out `` no pain , no problem ) with some of the older songs sprinkled throughout . and even after hearing all the songs , we still played the cd in the car on the way home . if you 're a fan of efo already , you probably own this cd already . if you 're new to the band , either this cd or any of their two live cd 's ( portable efo show and three rooms ) would be a good place to start . or , better yet , get all three . there is not one weak song on the entire cd . standouts include `` when the rain crashed down , '' `` baltimore , '' the title track , `` walk humbly , son '' and really , the rest of the album .
