i know that it sounds like hyperbole , but ... .. pure genius ! ! ! loveless is an absolutely essential album , and so much better than anything as of late - at least , better that anything i 've heard . imagine the most melodic guitar noise combined with exquisite vocals and intelligent lyrics , and you 'll get a sense of what loveless is all about . this is music of passion and of strange beauty - it 's like trying to describe a purple rose to a blind man . if you 're at all enamored by ambient music with a pronounced romantic stripe , you will love this ! so what are you waiting for ?
