raw music it takes a couple of listenings to to figure out which songs are the catchy ones and which ones are the genuinely good ones . but either way , all of the songs have this unpolished sound that makes it feel as if you 're listening to her around a campfire or something , even with all the special effects . 'make it hot ' 'recomendations ' 'after you left ' 'sun ' and 'body below ' are my personal favorites
