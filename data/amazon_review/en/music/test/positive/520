great collection , but they missed one an excellent compilation of the darker side of classical music , although i would have preferred a different rendition of toccata and fugue in d ( new york philharmonic perhaps ) , it 's still quite good . but how could the series producer leave off ravel 's pavane for a dead princess ? it 's preferable to symphonie fantastique - march to the scaffold , plus berlioz already makes an appearance with dream of a witches ' sabbath . if there was room , verdi 's requiem would have been a nice addition too . so i have to go with 4 stars only
