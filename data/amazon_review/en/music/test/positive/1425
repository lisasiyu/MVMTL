classics revisited and given new life ( 4.5 stars ) this album , technically , is not new . having been recorded over five years ago and released only in japan , scaggs chooses to revisit a number of his classic tunes -an unplugged `` lowdown , '' `` sierra , '' `` harbor lights '' and an glorious `` we 're all alone '' among others- and record them again under a moodier , at times even bluesier , light . think of some place between `` but beautiful '' and a more acoustic `` desire , '' if you are comparing albums . the core band , as well as the string arrangements , are tuned in to scaggs ' intent and contribute a great backdrop for his voice , which sounds quite great throughout these versions , the best example being the new take on `` simone . '' so , this is not quite a new album , we know the songs and it comes out after a long and inexplicable domestic delay , but the music contained here is pure boz , sometimes at his best
