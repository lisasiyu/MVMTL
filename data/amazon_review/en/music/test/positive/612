a harmonic sound all their own 'the mamas and the papas ' had a sound all their own , a unique kind of southern california blend , a harmony of at times melancholy beauty . they had one great singer , mama cass , whose 'dream a little dream of me ' is perhaps the closest thing they ever produced to a really great 'solo ' . their signature song and one of the unforgettable sixties song is 'california dreaming ' . it seemed to express a certain haunting longing , the longing for a place which then represented to many americans , california , the golden land of escape and new home . john phillips who like mama cass is no longer with us was the arranger , director who really made the 'mamas and papas ' into such a great group . it is strange even then their sound evoked a certain feeling of 'nostalgia ' but four decades later the jump of initial joy hearing them brings is truly complemented by the sense of a world long gone .
