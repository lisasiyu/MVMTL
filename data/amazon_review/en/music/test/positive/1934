addictive listenable dance music i personally do n't like repetitive boom*tch-boom*tch-boom*tch type of music that goes on for 10 minutes , erlende oye does a great job of selecting songs that are catchy but does n't get played out easily . maybe i 'm biased too , i like kings of convenience and royksopp , but this album is very upbeat , funky , yet diverse ( phoenix , avenue d ) . there 's no categorizing it , electro , house , pop , it 's just good catchy beats
