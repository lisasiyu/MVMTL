yes it is swampy honky tonk , but also deep soul food add james luther dickinson to the pile of producer/artists whose influence is vast but whose recognition , except with cognoscenti , is minimal . he is in august company , and runs a north mississippi/memphis recording studio on par with cowboy jack clements 's outside nashville . with the revival of attention in southern roots music prompted by the best selling `` o brother where art thou ? '' soundtrack and live recording , it is surprising dickinson 's own contribution , now available on cd , is overlooked . for with this album dickinson gives a voice more authentic than a mere preservationist . this is far beyond the earliest dickinson sounds from the sun-influenced `` the goat dancers '' period . indeed , the guitar solo on `` wine '' is a fabulous execution worthy of junior brown , while the jackhammer piano is full-on honky-tonk , and if it were not for dickinson 's bulk you 'd think the killer himself had kicked over the piano stool to rip it out . the drums can barely keep up , and the wet voices of backup singers already sneak in notes they will scream horizontally in the after show entertainment . and this is only the first cut on the album , not the best cut on the album . there are , perhaps , certain points of comparison with early recordings of `` little feat , '' to which this reviewer can only respond : they stole it all from dickinson
