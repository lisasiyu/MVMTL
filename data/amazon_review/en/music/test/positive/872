the classic quartet throughout coltrane 's prolific recording career he performed with many great musicians . one glance at his discography can affirm this fact and this disc features , arguably , his best surrounding musicians ; they have become known as simply the classic quartet . the featured aartists are jimmy garrison on bass , mccoy tyner on piano , elvin jones on drums and jc on saxophone ( s ) . if you are a collector of coltrane music this is a must have disc since it features his classic quartet in fine form . this is a late seminal recording from around the time of tranes album & quot ; ascension. & quot ; the title track , & quot ; living space & quot ; is a profound piece and an inspirational piece of artistry that is emotionally stirring . trane is featured playing in his innovative modal mode that was influenced from the timelessness of eastern indian music . since this was a posthumous release there are several tracks that were found that are untitled having only vault numbers . do not let this put you off since they are some of finest songs on the disc but not having a name to associate with the melody is a bit challenging for the listener . trane is at his improvisational best , reaching both vertically and horizontally on his sound , overlapping and interweaving with staggering results . the importance of the classic quartet to the totality of the sound can not be overly emphasized ; it was a combustible union that created magic that has lasted for generations . mccoy tyner played with a bouyancy that allowed for the shifting of sound in directions that were held together by the driving drums and pounding of the skins by elvin jones . this coupled with the thumping , harmonic bass of jimmy garrison created the one of tightest groups ever assemled in the annals of jazz history.this disc shows the fluidity of the players , each part contributing to the whole for a sound that has yet to be duplicated.trane is bluesy , melodic , at times he plays in a far reaching , writhing style , but eventually the tenderness returns for the warm lush sound that only he has been able to produce . his ceaseless explorations on the saxophone , exemplified by his quest for a muscial spirtitual search comes through on this fine collection of recordings . pieces of & quot ; a love supreme & quot ; and fragments of & quot ; my favorite things & quot ; can be heard echoing through the solos of trane as he explores his inner sanctity revealing his consciousness . this is definitely a disc for the coltrane or jazz connoisseur that features some of the last recrdings of the classic quartet . an excellent recording by some of the best at their collective apogee
