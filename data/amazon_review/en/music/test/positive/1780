shep fields , vol2 i 've always enjoyed shep fields orchestra . this cd is an excellent review of the music heard back in the early 40's.vocalist hal derwin 's liner notes tell the whole story of the fields band.some remarkably good accordion work by caesar muzzioli with this band . worthwhile listening
