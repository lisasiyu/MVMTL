saxophone , bass and drums make a great trio . sonny rollins , ray brown and shelly mann are all superb on this 71 minute album . it comprises 6 tunes ; three of which have alternate takes added as bonus tracks . the originals and alternates are similarly compelling . although my personnal favourite is wagon wheels , all 9 tracks are excellent . the uncanny sense of space and the western mood created by the trio make the cd great listening . i am a big fan of sonny rollins and his happy , muscular , witty , rich and edgy sound . this album sees all three musicians in marvellous form , with the rhythm section brilliantly creating the illusion of movement . i would recommend this as the album to buy to begin a sonny rollins collection . no words can adequately describe the treat that awaits you ; however some may point in the right direction . they are ; lyrical , witty , warm and imaginative . way out west is most original and is one of my favourite cds .
