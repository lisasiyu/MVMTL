electric cafe electric cafe was a very much delayed project and was originally called technopop and should have included the awesome single tour de france . after years of frustration and innuendo the album was finally released in 1986 . it is way of ahead of its time in its use of sampling , loops and the way they use their keyboards . it has 6 awesome tracks on it starting with boing boom tshak and ending with the hypnotic electric cafe , sex object is the best track on the entire cd with amazing beats , lyrics and a melody that is quite accomplished . the book-let is typical kraftwerk with very little information and odd looking photographs . the graphics may look basic today ( 2005 ) , but back in 1986 this was cutting edge and if one used computers back then , then one knows how advanced these graphics truly were for their time . this is a great album from kraftwerk . it is just a shame that they record so seldom these days
