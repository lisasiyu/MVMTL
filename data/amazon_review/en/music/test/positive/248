great mirman 's humor is an acquired taste , but once you acquire that taste , you will keep coming back and reveling in its deliciousness over and over again . the problem with eugene lies mostly in the fact that you have to appreciate utter absurdity in order to enjoy him . i can enjoy it and i love the album . take a sample , if you like one bit , take the whole thing . otherwise , wait awhile , mirman needs time to truly live up to his potential which he gives us a peak at in `` florida '' and `` shapes for sale .
