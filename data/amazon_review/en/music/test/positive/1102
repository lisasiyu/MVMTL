the best cd i am typically not a fan of `` live cds '' , but i have to say that this is absolutekly the best live cd i have ever heard . it makes you feel you are in the club with him . todd snider 's music is some of the best for such a youngster . this is obviously not a highly produced/made over cd so the recording quality of some songs is different , but as i said you are in the club with him ! there are a couple songs that i would have liked to have on there , but that leaves something for the next one . i have listened to it many , many times and i still laugh at his stories . i have let a variety of others ( a wide range of ages and interests ) and every one has enjoyed it . i recommend this cd with out one bit of reservation . the recording issues only adds to the enjoyment of feeling like you are there . should n't that be the goal of a live cd ?
