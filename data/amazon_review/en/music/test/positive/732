love , love , love `` the nightfly '' . my first introduction to donald fagen , was his `` new frontier '' video on mtv , which was in heavy rotation in 1983 . brillant video that accurately protrayed the story related in a great song . ( a special thanks to all the people who have posted the `` new frontier '' video on you tube . ) i loved the song and the video . years later with `` new frontier '' stuck in my head on a constant mental replay track , i bought `` the nightfly '' , and was amazed by how brillant the album was . the first shock was hearing `` i.g.y-international geophysical year '' , which i still hear on the radio , but never knew it was donald fagen . this is the first song on the album , followed by more wonderful songs . it 's a concept album , with the theme of the atomic age/new frontier movement of the late 1950 's and early 1960 's . it captures both the optimism of new technology leading the way , with the underlying hint of fear , that some of this atomic age technology might be the end of the world . the pop culture references in some of the songs are wonderful , as they help convey the feeling of that time . the song `` new frontier '' has several references-actress tuesday weld from `` the many lives of dolby gillis '' and jazz great brubeck are mentioned in it . as far as concept albums go , i would put this up there with pink floyds `` the wall '' or `` dark side of the moon '' . it is much closer to `` dark side '' musically . the best thing about `` the nightfly '' is it 's mellow , with catchy hooks and grooving rhythms . it 's great to listen both actively to hear the stories convenved in the songs , but also works if you just want nice background music . some of songs are also fun for dancing too . i can listen to this entire album from start to finish , happy with every song on it . it 's a rare for an artist to be able to put out an album like that . i 'd love to see the videos made for this album released on dvd
