very entertaining i did n't think that i was a beck fan , but i happened to hear this when a friend was playing it in his car and was instantly drawn into it . i have been playing it frequently ever since . it is the first cd i have ever owned that has anything akin to rap or hip hop and i just really like how he blends it into so many other styles to create a complete feeling of a musical environment . i will be delving into some of his other cds in the future
