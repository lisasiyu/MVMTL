probably the most fun on a police album i first listened to the two main singles from this album , `` message in a bottle '' and `` walking on the moon , '' when i bought the greatest hits album . `` walking on the moon '' has slowly become my favorite police song mainly for its simplistic yet hypnotic rhythm and its quirky yet intriguing lyrics . i had heard the track `` the bed 's too big without you '' some time later , and i decided to buy this album . the same time , i bought synchronicity , being as that is their final proper album and had some great tracks on it . the funny thing is this : i found synchronicity to be a let-down and regatta de blanc to be a triumph . the key to this whole album is what the title of is means : white reggae . with a heavy influence of reggae , all of the songs come together in a nice fashion . the lyrics have some bite to it and the music can be fierce when it needs to be , but the police finally sit back and develop intricate rhythms too all of their songs . sting said that he used the spacious reggae bass style because it gave him room to sing , and it absolutely shows here . he beats the hell out of ub40 when it comes to white reggae singing . his voice is absolutely unique , a true instrument rather than just a voice . summers develops a cool , collected style of guitar , loud when it needs to be , but never too flashy . copeland encompasses everything and becomes one of the greatest drummers to walk the planet . nothing shows that cohesion more than the instrumental title track , and it deservedly won a grammy for best rock instrumental performance . that track sums up the album very nicely : a straight rock album with the intricacies of reggae , and it stands just underneath zenyatta mondatta as the best of the police
