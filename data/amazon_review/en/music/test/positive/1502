happy birthday , association ! it was 1968 , and the association , hot off the success of their third album , `` insight out , '' and it 's monster hit single , `` windy , '' went back into the studio and recorded their fourth album , `` birthday . '' once again , this classy sextet deliver some of the best flower-power pop-rock ever made . these catchy , melodic songs are truly awesome , highlighted by the band 's expert musical chemistry and vocal harmonies . the album includes more association classics as `` like always , '' `` everything that touches you , '' `` time for livin ' , '' and `` time it is today , '' but also such great buried treasures like the punchy `` come on in , '' the beautiful `` rose petals , incense and a kitten '' ( a silly title , i know , but the song is truly gorgeous ) , the equally exquisite `` toymaker , '' the haunting `` barefoot gentleman , '' and the excellent `` bus song , '' featuring a great bit of barbershop vocalising in the middle . when it comes to pop-rock , the association were ( and are ) true geniuses . `` birthday '' is a brilliant album , one of the band 's best .
