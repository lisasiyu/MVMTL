cd 's the shizzle dizzle y'all ! ! ! how can you not love a bunch of guys out to make some real quality latin/rock/jam music ? every one of the band members has talent out the wazhoo . the only criticism i can make is that they toned it down too much for the cd . it 's real chill , pre-game type music but when you see them live all you wan na do is grab a fine lady and dance till you wear her sexy latin legs out ! ! buy the cd , but more importantly , if they 're ever playing near you do n't even hesitate to buy a ticket ( and make sure you have a date ! ) ! ! !
