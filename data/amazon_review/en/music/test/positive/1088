a blues timemachine absolutely one of the finest live albums of all times . i bought this album because it was listed as one of the top 100 guitar albums of all time in guitar player magazine . you get lightning in a bottle here with bb king at the height of his powers . the audience is alive and you can feel the young woman hyperventilating and swooning to bb king 's rendition of some blues classics . his voice is flawless , still velvety smooth , especially when compared with later live albums by bb king . there is the perfect mixture of bb king 's introductions or setups for each tune , guitar , vocals and audience reaction . the sound is immaculate , balanced and clear . his guitar playing is efficient and his timing is perfect . it makes you wonder why more recent `` live albums '' lack the spontaneity and quality found in this recording . the only regret is the album is not longer .
