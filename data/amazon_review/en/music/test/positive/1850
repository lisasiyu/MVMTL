humble name , real roots rock legends the follow-up to the original `` best of '' ngdb collection , more great dirt , consists of more of the 80 's country hits during their long career . the ngdb was once a folk and country-rock band , but the majority of the songs on more great dirt come from their mainstream country days , which were the most overlooked of their albums . they really had no one big radio hit during this time ( except for `` fishin ' in the dark ) , which hurts this record , as does the fact that it is very overshadowed by the `` will the circle be unbroken '' albums that were huge hits . the highlights of the album include the summertime hit `` fishin ' in the dark , '' bruce springsteen 's `` cadillac ranch , '' and the rocking `` down that road tonight . '' it is too bad that there are only ten tracks here . in my opinion , this is n't up to par with the classic ngdb , but it is still good , quality country and folk . a good purchase if you want an overview of their latter days
