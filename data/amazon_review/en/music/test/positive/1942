full metal jacket full metal jacket is by far one of the best movies i have ever seen . although the language is too strong for many people ( not for me ) , it definately puts the point across about the harsh life of marines during training on the island . the sniper scene is very well done as well . gunnery sergeant hartman is portrayed by an excellent actor who is able to scream obscenities at his troops without even cracking a smile , i would like to see the bloopers reel from full metal jacket
