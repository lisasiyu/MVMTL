mariah carey is amazing mariah carey is one of the all-time best singers in music history . her ability to hit typically unfathomable notes is , of course , her trademark and signature ; but unlike some of her contemporaries , especially the late 90s and early 2000s pop stars like britney spears , her singing is the reason for her popularity , as it should be for any singer . her # 1 's is a great cd , as are many compilation records by artists because they feature their big hits and not the filler from the actual studio releases . impressively , carey has had an incredible amount of singles but also an amazing number of no . 1 's , more than any other female artist and rivaling only the beatles and elvis presley . even though # 1 's is not meant to be a greatest hits package ( as carey has said in the enclosed album art ) like her official greatest hits cd released several years later , it certainly comes off as one . mariah 's voice remains powerful throughout the years as heard on # 1 's . brilliant -- certainly worth purchasing because it compiles the sound that made the 1990s
