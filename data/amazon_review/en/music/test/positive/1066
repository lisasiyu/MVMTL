quirky melancholy brilliance brad mehldau first came to my attention with his percussive yet lyrical take on radiohead 's `` paranoid android '' on his album `` largo . '' i thought it was stunning , ambitious , and fresh . it gave me new respect for this song from radiohead 's 90s masterpiece `` ok computer '' ; `` paranoid android '' is a tripartate `` day in the life '' for a sadder wiser time more than 30 years after the beatles disbanded . here mehldau 's breakthrough piece is expanded to 20 minutes in a live format uinaccompanied by his trio . it still has riveting moments , but is less impressive than his version on `` largo . '' there is plenty here to make up for that . nick drake , a 60s/70s folkie rediscovered recently through a volkswagon commercial which featured his hypnotic `` pink moon , '' gets the mehldau treatment twice . drake 's already jazzy `` riverman '' is expanded on , deconstructed , explored . his mysterious `` things behind the sun '' opens the album nicely . mehdlau 's idiosyncrasies seem under control at first but increase as the album proceeds like a fidgeting child still for only for a few minutes at a time . this is just fine as the quirky jazz pianist covers another quirky jazz pianist : thelonious monk . jazz standards are another strength of mehldau 's since they need his strange flourishes and dense pounding chords to attain new life . the choices of monk , gershwin , drake , and radiohead continue to mehldau tradition of being a liason between traditional and avant-garde jazz . this live album , with its enthusiatic japanese audience , requires patience with its long meanderings , which are sometimes too far from the melody he 's interpreting and just generally overlong . my four-star review is to say : there 's more here interesting than distracting
