a milestone ! should you ever meet someone who 's ranting about `` the eighties '' and the supposedly `` bad '' music of that decade ... just put on this great record ! the songs are well crafted , perfectly recorded and the whole album is absolutely not `` trendy '' . with that i mean that you could never tell it was made in 1984 . clearly you can spot it 's not from the seventies ... but listening back to it , now , i notice how it has n't aged a bit ! ... and it features the most classic lineup of the band ! you just could n't ask for more ! ! ; -
