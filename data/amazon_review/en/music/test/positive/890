heavy stuff this is one awesome cd . i bought the oncoming storm before this one and i prefer the stings of conscience . this cd just plain rocks , heavy . sweet for head banging , the guitars amaze me , drumming super fast , screaming is solid throughout and nothing is wrong with this cd . perfect 5 stars . all metalheads must buy this . fav songs : one step away , stings of conscience , my desire . so just buy it already , and get ready to be annihilated
