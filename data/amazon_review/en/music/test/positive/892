is there no end to duke 's creativity ? miles davis once said every one ought to get down on their knees and thank duke , after listening to this album you 'll see why . i am big fan of duke and the amazing creativity displayed in this album is awesome . there is no bebop , avant guarde , free jazz present just straight ahead swinging crafted beautiful music . the playing is exemplary and does successfully what it set out to do , provide interpretations of shakespeare characters and plays . the genius of the man is such that this music can be listened to without references to the bard 's work and is awesome in ever aspect . melodic , interpetative , improvisational jazz at its best , my only 'problem ' is i ca n't decide which track i like best so i am forced to listen to the music again and again and again and ... oh well : - ) buy this album you wo n't regret . if music be the food of love play ( swing ) on ellington play on . sound familar ? ? enjo
