the best final fantasy music for one of the best games ever . i very rarely buy a soundtrack , especially to a videogame , however this one left me with no choice but to do so . this easily the best videogame music i have ever listened to . i guess one reason behind me buying this is the fact that unlike many psx games , this one you can not listen to as a backwards compatible cd ( all the final fantasies are this way ) and the poor music cd that came with anthologies left me wanting more . no this is well worht purchasing even if you do n't like the game , the music is more than enough to make this worth owning
