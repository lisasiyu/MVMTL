the continued evolution of a genius anyone who talks about & quot ; fading genius & quot ; in reference to this album is out of their mind . it is true that by the time sly released & quot ; heard ya missed me ... & quot ; the band had hit the nadir of its creative output , but their downward slope did not start until well after this album was recorded . & quot ; small talk & quot ; is in fact a brilliant follow up to fresh , and a brilliant acheivement in it own right . the album retains the positive lyrical content , but it redirects that positivity toward more personal and family oriented themes . the arrangements are less in your face , the feel is a lot more relaxed , and there is even a lot of ( absolutely wonderful ) studio chatter to preface certain songs . sly could never release two similar albums in a row , so for this album he broke with protocol in another senese that a lot of these reviewers do n't get : & quot ; small talk & quot ; is a soul album . here is why : the grooves are subtler and more sedate , violins are involved ( but not in a cheesy way ) , and there is a new emphasis on gutwrenching , heartfelt vocals . indeed , both sly and rosie turn in their best vocal performances here . i think many of the people who have reviewed & quot ; small talk & quot ; here on amazon have missed this point entirely , but you might miss it as well . so , if you 're looking another agressive funk album the likes of riot or fresh , you will also be severely dissapointed by & quot ; small talk & quot ; and should not buy it . however , if you like albums like donnie hathaway 's & quot ; everything is everything , & quot ; or if you cymande 's downtempo stuff , or charles wright and the 103st rythym band , then spare no expense and immediately purchase this japanese import . this is one of the best soul albums ever recorded ( which is not to say it 's not funky . ) if you bought & quot ; the essential sly and the family stone & quot ; like i did , you 've already heard time for livin ' and loose booty . like me , you probably thought they were solid tracks but would not persuade you to buy a 30 dollar cd . well , after hearing small talk in its entirety i can honestly say that those are the two weakest tracks on here . sly was a genius and this album chronicles his continued evolution . it is a must have for anyone who likes sly , soul , funk , or even just music . the fact that this small talk is not available in america is a profound statement about the way our nation treats its visionaries and cultural giants
