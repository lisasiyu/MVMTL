unjustly overlooked i was just telling my boss about this record today ! to be honest with you , the first two yes albums are better than the more bombastic and commercially-successful records which follow . the original band focused on short , intricately-arranged , pieces . yes started out thinking `` how beautiful and interesting a statement can we make ? '' and ended up thinking `` how can we impress the audience with our musical cleverness ? '' these two records are often compared to the beatles , but i think they also show the influence of `` odessey and oracle '' -era zombies
