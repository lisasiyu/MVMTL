i have loved this album since 2002 ... ... when i discovered it in hawaii . whenever i listen to it , i remember the peace i found there , and i used several of the songs at my wedding . in fact , the main song `` shores of avalon '' became the basis of the theme to my wedding last year . i also used one of the songs `` full moonlight dance '' to create a dance ensemble piece with persian , middle eastern and ballet influences , which was performed at a concert in burbank , ca in 2003 . i tried to write to tina malia to tell her how much i love the album , and also think the musicianship is fantastic , but could n't get a message through . perhaps she is a true gypsy . anyway , i come into contact with lots of different world music , and this album consistently rates as one of my top favorites
