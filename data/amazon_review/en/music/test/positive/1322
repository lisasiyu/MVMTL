a classic i love this album ! i see in the discussions someone said you would only like this if you are `` bitter and angry '' ... well , that 's not me ... and i love this album . shirley manson is amazing . not only is she gorgeous , she is a fabulous singer , and a great , intelligent writer . although i do n't agree with all the philosophies she puts into her songs ( though yes , i 'm anti-war and think she articulated in `` boys wan na fight '' what 's going on really well , i do n't think a `` free love '' revolution will solve anything on personal or political levels ... '' sex is not the enemy '' is a great song music-wise though ... end tangent ) , i think she 's a great example for women in many ways . we 're not all waiting for a man to come along and `` make it all better . '' we 're not all demure . shirley 's lyrics express that in a society that does not accept it . go shirley . i have heard people complain that this album is more straight-up rock n'roll and less `` electronic '' than 2.0 , but that is the hallmark of a great band . the beatles had `` sgt . pepper '' as well as `` let it be '' . led zeppelin did `` black dog '' as well as `` tangerine . '' great bands have range . garbage is the only band i love that came out of the 90 's . and they 're still rockin ' in the 2000 's . listening to this album has helped me alot through some recent times . there are some very uplifting songs , as well as some songs that are so deep , true , and sad that they make me cry . beautifully written . i saw garbage in concert in spring '05 . shirley manson is even more jaw-droppingly captivating in person . rock on , garbage ! and thank you for all the great music .
