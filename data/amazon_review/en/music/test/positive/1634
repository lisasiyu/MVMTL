the killer 's greatest album of the 70's after making a well-deserved comeback as a solid country artist in the late 60 's , jerry lee lewis went to england in 1973 and recorded this great album that was a welcome return to his rock n ' roll roots . lewis recorded some good albums throughout the 70 's , but most of them were aimed primarily at the country music market . this is pure rock n ' roll all the way , with a couple of old blues tunes thrown in the mix as well . the london sessions sounds like one big jam session with jerry lee lewis in his prime , pounding his way through a selection of great classic tunes like johnny b. goode , what 'd i say , movin ' on down the line , no headstone on my grave , and baby what you want me to do . the studio band of top british musicians lay down some strong backing to jerry lee 's great piano playing and singing , and the spontaneous , live in the studio feel of this album is an approach that brings out the best in jerry lee . highlights include a rockin ' version of johnny b. goode , a superior remake of his old sun recording drinkin ' wine spo-dee-o-dee that kicks off the album , and a truly dynamic medley of little richard hits that ends it . it is great to see that this has been remastered on cd since this is probably jerry lee 's most vibrant album and surely one of the best rock n ' roll albums of 1973 . any lover of classic rock needs to get their hands on this cd . this is simply the best set of rock n ' roll the killer has recorded since his classic sun recordings
