one of the few greatest hits albums that actually satisfy when it comes to `` best of 's '' and compilations , very rarely can a collection successfully comprise a solid overview of a band 's catalog . the smashing pumpkins ' `` greatest hits '' is one of the few of these collections that actually satisfies , providing a very solid overview of the songs that propelled the band to stardom . singles from `` gish '' to `` machina : the machines of god '' are covered here , as well as `` eye '' from the soundtrack to david lynch 's lost highway , and unreleased songs `` real love '' and `` untitled '' , which are actually pretty good as well . the only real downsides to this compilation are that no other non-singles are covered here , and the cd booklet features no kind of commentary at all from any of the band members . that aside , for casual fans of the smashing pumpkins , `` greatest hits '' is n't a bad pick up at all
