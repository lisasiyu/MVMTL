high tide - self-titled ( repertoire ) originally released in 1970 , as this was the band 's follow-up to 'space shanties ' ( see my review ) . also even has the very same line-up , except that group founder tony hill does some vocals . just three tracks here , `` blankman cries again '' ( 8:38 ) , `` the joke '' ( 9:29 ) and the epic `` saneonymous '' ( 14:30 ) , where simon house 's violin playing is simply superb . a decent progressive/art rock piece of work here . most definitely an acquired taste . that 's for sure
