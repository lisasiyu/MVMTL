totally unsurpassed film-score music ! this dual cd set unambiguously deserves many more stars than just a puny five ! i have heard none finer . and only a few cds of equal quality . the legendary miklos rozsa is the film 's composer . this is the inaugural release of rozsa 's complete score for the 1959 film ben hur ( bh ) . the cds contain 88 tracks in the same order as in the composer 's original score . by `` complete , '' i mean there is more music here than there was actually in the film . this is because the cds include unedited cues and music from film outtakes plus one alternative track . the vast majority of tracks were recorded on the m-g-m sound stage with sizable orchestras of up to 75 performers . the result is sound of intense richness , but not to the point where ensembles over whelmed individual instruments ( of which there were quite a few `` unusual '' ones ) . not surprisingly , rozsa won an academy award for bh ( his third ) . while you can debate which of rozsa 's score is his best ( my personal favorite is his music for the 1947 film the red house ) , there is no debate over the undisputed fact that all his 90 or so film composition are simply ( or very close to ) magnificent . the cd booklet is over-the-top outstanding , and easily the most extensive ever created . more of a book than a booklet , it 's authors , marilee bradford ( ms. bradford is also produced the cd set ) and the late tony thomas , have provided us with a definitive source of reference . rozsa was probably the only composer of his time who could create the score for bh . this cd set is probably the only recording of our time that demands to be in your collection . william flanigan , ph.d
