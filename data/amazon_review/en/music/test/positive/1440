outstanding ! ! ! a great album from start to finish if you are tired of the cookie cutter , assembly line garbage that passes for country music these days , then pick up this cd for a refreshing change . if you are looking for a singer who makes you sit up and pay attention to the lyrics , then this album is a must have . the songs run the gamut emotionally . from tear jerkers such as blue wing and veteran 's day , to foot stomping tunes like gallo del cielo this album covers all the bases
