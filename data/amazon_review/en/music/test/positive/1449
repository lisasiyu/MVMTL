classic szell if you want to hear george szell and the cleveland orchestra at the peak of their famed mozartean sound , look no further than this disc . these works , both originally chamber pieces , are perfect showpieces for szell 's chamber-music style of mozart playing . these recordings capture szell and the orchestra at the prime of their partnership , combining the punchy , almost gutteral orchestral sound szell favored with transparent delineation of details and almost scary rhythmic and tonal precision . there are other , equally valid styles of playing these works , but none that are better . of course the german dances , with boskovsky and his ensemble at the helm , are well played and enjoyable too , but they 're the icing on a very substantial cake . do n't miss the opportunity to pick up this budget-priced piece of definitive mozart interpretation
