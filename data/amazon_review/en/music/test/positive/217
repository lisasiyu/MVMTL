a dream worth waiting for a dream is what your heart makes . and for years we 've been dreaming and wishing that cinderella would make a comeback . and thanks to the magic of disney , our wish has been granted . ( please do not mix up this cinderella with the punk-rock band of the same name . this is music ; that is a mess . ) we are happy to see ( and hear ) that extra tracks , including two demo recordings . and though we understand disney 's marketing techniques , we do wish that the added performances by jim brickman and kimberely locke would go away . maybe if we close our eyes real tight and chant those three magic words . all together now : bibbidi-bobbidi-boo ..
