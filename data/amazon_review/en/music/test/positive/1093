sisters rock out ! the ross sisters-amber , sarah & julia- who make up everlife- rock out on their self- titled cd ! bright , sharp & upbeat these girls outdo most of the young male rock bands around today . i enjoy every track on the cd but especially enjoy what i like about you , now or never , and the ballad angels cry . the latter song- harkens back to their christian rock roots and is very uplifting and inspiring ! it should be noted that the girls write many of the songs on the cd and play guitars as well . this is not a manufactured act but a real band ! this cd deserves to be a big hit- buy it now
