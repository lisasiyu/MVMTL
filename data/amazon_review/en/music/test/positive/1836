another great live compilation by hendrix 's `` band of gypsys ! '' i will be doing a review on the legendary historic landmark 2-cd live compilation set entitled `` jimi hendrix - band of gypsys - live at the fillmore east '' by the late great guitar legend jimi hendrix . as always , i will be editing this review from time to time so that you the consumer will get the best and most accurate review possible . in case you have n't read my previous review on the `` band of gypsys '' dvd documentary , this is actually a continuation review of the `` band of gypsys '' saga , this time focusing and highlighting on some of jimi 's unreleased song performances that were performed `` live at the fillmore east '' on 31 december 1969 and 1 january 1970 . this latest 2-cd set , like the dvd documentary , were both separately released in 1999 and includes additional unreleased song performances that were not included in the original partial six song live compilation released in 1970 entitled `` hendrix - band of gypsys . '' in case you do n't remember , there was another live compilation ( a sequel ) of additional unreleased performances that was released by capitol records on vinyl and cassette in 1986 , but not on cd , entitled `` jimi hendrix - band of gypsys 2 . '' with this new latest 1999 2-cd live compilation collection , along with the original 1970 and the then latest 1986 collection , these new unreleased performances shed a new light in the `` band of gypsys '' saga and legacy resulting in bringing these partial fillmore east concerts to life . with this being fact , these newly released performances add much more to the `` band of gypsys '' legend and is clearly becoming more evident of being a truer testament in showing the further advancement of the band 's fully creative side while performing live , in how mixing and combining rock n ' roll , soul , r & b , blues and funk can result in a new powerfully explosive sound of music . before i go any further , i would like to go way back to the beginning . in my dvd documentary review , i have stressed many contributing factors on the ideas and beginnings resulting in the birth and formation of the `` band of gypsys , '' along with the many contributing factors and incidents that would fatally prove disastrous and eventually break up the `` band of gypsys . '' in this latest 2-cd release , i will go further and stress another important contributing factor that was not discussed in my previous dvd documentary review . this is another one of many contributing factors that would result in the birth of the `` band of gypsys . '' according to numerous hendrix biographies and the attached liner booklet that accompanied this 2-cd live compilation set , the genesis , the root of the beginning that started all of this actually evolved from a serious problem jimi neglected which began back in 1965 . in 1965 , jimi was then , a typical hungry musician , who would sign any contract or any piece of paper in hopes that it would further advance his career . having signed numerous contracts and many pieces of paper to many , unfortunately , for jimi , there was one piece of paper that jimi signed that would haunt him after he became famous . since jimi did not fulfill his obligations with this particular company , as was the case for the many others jimi forgot about , the plaintiff 's and attorneys representing this opposing company would file a lawsuit against jimi demanding satisfaction . with this lawsuit pending , jimi figured that the only way to resolve and settle this lawsuit was to give them something that would satisfy and resolve this issue . with this in mind , jimi would contact and approach his long time friend and army buddy named billy cox and explained what had happened . it was at this point , when it was decided by jimi to settle out of court by giving the company plantiff 's a new studio album recording for them to release . cox 's reply to this statement was , `` lets go for it ! '' also during this time , while hendrix and cox were discussing these matters further into details , and jimi 's drummer mitch mitchell taking a break in england , buddy miles was a frequent visitor as well as a spectator in the studios with jimi and billy . when miles was told about jimi 's misfortunes and his circumstances surrounding his situation , miles decided the same fate and results as billy . miles reply was , `` lets help our friend in need . '' with jimi sharing and explaining his new ideas for a new sound with cox and miles , the two would agree on liking jimi 's new ideas and would help in fulfilling these goals by playing a mixture and a combination of rock n ' roll , soul , r & b , blues and funk . with these new goals and the stage now being set , this newly born trio would eventually become known as , the `` band of gypsys . '' with cox 's and miles ' full cooperation and their loyalty to jimi , jimi now felt a little at ease and believed that a resolution would soon be in the works in his legal matter . in order to create this ultimate new sound for this new album , jimi elected in preparing fresh new original material . jimi really wanted to record these fresh new original songs in the studio for the sole purpose , and hopes , of fulfilling his legal obligations to this company by giving them a new studio album recording for them to release , and resolve and close this legal matter . but with the fillmore east shows coming up , preparations such as practicing and rehearsing the new song material as well as the familiar songs for the upcoming shows , and with little time remaining , would soon become the main priority resulting in the postponement of the studio recordings of the new songs and therefore , laid aside . with jimi and his management being harassed and subjected to increasing pressure from the company plaintiff 's attorneys , in order to satisfy the capitol / ppx settlement , a new decision was made by jimi 's manager mike jeffery to record all four of the forthcoming live fillmore east concert performances . this decision was rendered in hopes of releasing a live compilation album rather than a studio album . with all of this in mind , and showtime about to commence , all four concert performances spanning two evenings , were recorded onto tape on 31 december 1969 and 1 january 1970 . sadly , these 2-cd live compilation performances contain only sixteen of the many numerous songs that were performed in those four shows . however , it is also evident that these sixteen live song tracks do clearly audibly indicate and show the brilliance and expertise of some of the new genuine original and well-performed song material besides the regularly well known popular hendrix songs . these sixteen live song tracks sounded excellent ! the sixteen live song tracks contained and listed in this 2-cd live compilation set are reviewed as follows : disc 1 ( 1 . ) `` stone free , '' ( 1 january 1970 , second show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( 2 . ) `` power of soul , '' ( 1 january 1970 , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( 3 . ) `` hear my train a comin ' , '' ( 31 december 1969 , first show ) ( excellent well performed slow blues song ! ) ( 4 . ) `` izabella , '' ( 31 december 1969 , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( 5 . ) `` machine gun , '' ( 1 january 1970 , second show ) ( one of the very first live recordings of this legendary song . it is a powerful and explosive song well performed ! excellent ! outstanding ! as i 've stressed in my other past reviews concerning this legendary song , i 've described this song in this manner ; `` jimi actually presents and brings the vietnam war to the fillmore east audience crowd resulting in firing rounds of machine gun bullets through his powerfully explosive and violent guitar and ending with an excellent breathtaking guitar solo from jimi . '' ) ( 6 . ) `` voodoo child '' ( slight return ) ( 1 january 1970 , second show ) ( an excellent version of one of my favorites ) and ( 7 . ) `` we got ta live together . '' ( 1 january 1970 , second show ) ( excellent song ! well performed ! ) disc 2 ( 1 . ) `` auld lang syne , '' ( 31 december 1969 , second show ) ( well performed the jimi hendrix and `` band of gypsys '' way ) ( 2 . ) `` who knows , '' ( 31 december 1969 , first show ) ( excellent ! outstanding ! great song ! ) ( 3 . ) `` changes , '' ( 31 december 1969 , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( 4 . ) `` machine gun , '' ( 31 december 1969 , second show ) ( another excellent well performed version . refer to disc 1 for my review of the other version of `` machine gun . '' my opinions of these two songs are the same . this version is also excellent ! outstanding ! ) ( 5 . ) `` stepping stone , '' ( 1 january 1970 , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) ( 6 . ) `` stop , '' ( 1 january 1970 , first show ) ( another excellent song ! ) ( 7 . ) `` earth blues , '' ( 1 january 1970 , second show ) ( another excellent song ! ) ( 8 . ) `` burning desire '' ( 1 january 1970 , first show ) ( excellent song ! ) and ( 9 . ) `` wild thing . '' ( 1 january 1970 , second show ) ( the troggs classic song performed the hendrix and `` band of gypsys '' way . an excellent well performed version ! ) as story has it , and according to the attached cd liner notes and numerous hendrix biographies , technical problems ruined the two new years eve concerts . a malfunctioning microphone at the outset of the first show rendered energetic versions of `` power of soul '' and `` lover man '' unusable . similar problems hampered the start of the second concert set , compromising the fidelity of the `` auld lang syne / who knows '' medley . nonetheless , these minor trifles made little impact on jimi and the `` band of gypsys . '' in closing , my dvd documentary review stressed on the many main incidents and problems that resulted in disasters and the many contributing factors which would lead jimi into a deep depression and therefore , begin his demise and decline of his health . sadly , the `` band of gypsys '' era would prove to be , short lived , courtesy of the evil crooked plotted schemes of jimi 's manager , mike jeffery . it may have also been at this point ; ( despite all of the incidents and disasters that unfolded in the past , the most recent and the many numerous ones still to come ) that bitter tensions and bad differences would develop , intensify and continually worsen the relationship between hendrix and jeffery . despite all of the tensions and disasters , jimi hendrix is still undoubtedly , the greatest guitarist that ever lived . also , despite being held back and limiting his masterful creativity by jeffery , jimi still performed and played his guitar at a peak unmatched by many of the great guitar legends . jimi hendrix is quite simply , extremely rare , unique and irreplaceable . jimi hendrix 's mark in rock n ' roll history is forever secured . there will never be another jimi hendrix . thanks for your time in reading my long lengthy review and i hope you enjoyed reading it as much as i enjoyed writing it for all of you . i also hope that you will read all of my other reviews in the near future when time permits . jimi lives ! long live rock n ' roll ! rock out always . take care , j.l .
