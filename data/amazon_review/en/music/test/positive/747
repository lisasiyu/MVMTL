great album to listen to together ! my five-year-old daughter and i really love this cd . the covers are great `` versions '' of the originals , and the original tracks are great additions to the overall feel of this cd . maroon 5 's `` pure imagination '' is fantastic , as is the dixie chick 's `` the rainbow connection . '' it 's a great cd to listen to together and it does n't drive you crazy after the fifth time because it 's kinda `` rockin ' '' . if your children are strictly into `` kiddie '' types of music , i.e . laurie berkner , this probably is n't going to be their thing . my daughter is older and is , thankfully , expanding her musical tastes . this is something we both enjoy , minus the singing veggies and all ... i highly recommend this to more mature children
