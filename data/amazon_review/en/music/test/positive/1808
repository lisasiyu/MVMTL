what ? ! no electronics ! hurray ! armaggedon , gone in 60 seconds , enemy of the state , deep blue sea , american outlaws , national treasure . most of these scores are good but all too electonic . rabin restrains himself from using any electronic instrument on this score . from the get-go , the score sounds like a mix of saving private ryan for the main theme and a hint of the thin red line for the subtle moments . its a well done mixture . `` the rescue '' starts off much like the saving private ryan ending with a patriotic brass section . the song greatly displays rabin 's departure from his more recent scores . another good track featuring the brassy theme in its entirety is `` the great raid '' . the complete theme is not heard on the movie but at least we get it on the album . there is only one action song and two tense songs . `` raid begins '' is action . `` rangers start '' and `` stealing medicine '' are tense . `` the geat raid '' track is a mixture of both elements since its a bit tense before coming to a tiumphant close to signal the conclusion of the raid . this score is orchestral , a first for rabin making this his most challenging . i recommend this score to all drama score lovers . i also recommend saving private ryan , band of brothers , we were soldiers and the thin red line as well
