possibly the best soundtrack eva this soundtrack is as good as the movie . the standout tracks are know the ledge , uptown anthem , and its goin down . this is a classic in everyway . a mix of rap/r & b , and east/west . you cant go wrong with this . my only gripe is a track or two from the movie is'nt on here . kill a man by cypress hill
