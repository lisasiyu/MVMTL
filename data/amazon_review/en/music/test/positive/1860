`` another ac/dc triumph '' let there be rock is an amazing album filled with smash hits such as `` whole lotta rosie '' and `` let there be rock '' . and other great songs like `` dog eat dog '' . this is a must-have album for anyone that likes classic ac/dc . 1 . go down- this song is okay , a pretty good rocker . 7/10 2 . dog eat dog- one of my all-time favorite ac/dc songs . it has a catchy beat and a good chorus . 9/10 3 . let there be rock- a classic rocker , this song tells the story of how rock came to be . 8/10 4 . bad boy boogie- a mediocre song , gets kind of repetitive , but has a good bluesy feel . 7/10 5 . problem child- a very catchy song , but why did they put it on here again ? it was originally on dirty deeds done dirt cheap . 8/10 6 . overdose- this song 's kind of filler , but has good guitar . 7/10 7 . hell ai n't a bad place to be- good song , just a plain rocker . 8/10 8 . whole lotta rosie- funny song , and has good guitar . a little disturbing though . 8/10 this ac/dc album is almost like a ac/dc : greatest hits , because it has a lot of good songs on it . definitely something to have in your collection
