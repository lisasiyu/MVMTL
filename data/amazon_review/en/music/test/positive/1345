call me in the morning with some great recent soundtracks from `` ladder 49 , '' `` the aviator '' & `` wicker park , '' i thought it would be great to revisit this classic soundtrack from 1998 . `` practical magic '' holds up well 7 years after its release as a song collection . my favorite is nilsson 's `` coconut . '' it 's interesting that the producers use his first name since he always went by just his last name on his own releases . however , that track with `` put the lime in the coconut & drink it all up , call me in the morning & i 'll tell you what to do '' is just the classic feel good track . joni mitchell 's `` a case of you '' from her classic `` blue '' album sounds at home in this set , `` i 'm a lonely painter ; i live in a box of paints ; i 'm frightened by the devil & i 'm drawn to those ones that ai n't afraid . i remember that time you told me love is touching souls , surely you touched mine . '' joni marries such a unique melody with poetic lyrics that any set rises from her inclusion . stevie nicks ' two songs are both great inclusions from this enigmatic singer . `` crystal '' builds nicely with her soothing vocals , `` i turned around & the water was closing all around like a glove , like the love i finally found me . '' the opener `` if ever you did believe '' has a lovely melody that draws you in with repeated listenings . faith hill 's `` this kiss '' had to be about the catchiest country song of the 90s & is classic in any setting . marvin gaye 's track `` got to give it up ( pt . 1 ) '' has an infectious driving beat superimposed over party sounds . lisa hall is not an artist i know , but this track has good energy and drive . nick drake was one of my favorites when he was alive . his moody folk driven melodies touched a chord as does this track `` black eyed dog . '' `` practical magic '' is an excellent collection of music . enjoy !
