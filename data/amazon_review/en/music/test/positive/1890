his overall best ! while i was kind of slow to get this because of his use of beats that i heard before on `` smooth operator '' and his second r & b release `` i get the job done , '' other singles like `` calling mr . welfare '' and `` another victory '' ( some of the illest flows ever in a rap record ! ! ! ) , i had no choice but to get it . while he was in the process or abandoning marley marl ( for a lack of gong platinum like he felt that he should have . he wanted to be the next ll and could have been ... ) , this album turns out to be better ( overall ) than his first one because he has more songs on it . the songs are good and the beats are hot although some songs use beats that we have heard beofore . in order to understand ( young people and those new to hip-hop ) why the big daddy kane and rakim are mentioned as the best while they are not seen or heard from , you have to get their first two albums . if you do n't understand then , you never will . if you think that tupac was a great mc or that tupac and/or biggie were the greatest of all time , then you would hate on this album because you listened during a time of simplistic lyrics and a persona ( and looks.tupac ) that sold in instead of real skills . if you hear this and you can not say that bdk and rakim are the best rappers ever , then you judge rappers by how much violence they bring and how much crap they talk . none of these rapper can even compare to one paragragh by bdk on this album . he alomst took ll 's spot after that kool moe dee battle almost did ll in ( they 'forgot ' to mention that on `` behind the music ... '' ) , but after ll came out with `` to the break of dawn '' and `` jingling baby , '' ll was back on top . bdk . a man who ruined his own career . i still ca n't get over it..
