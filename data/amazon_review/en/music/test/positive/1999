the james dean of jazz this , ladies and gentlemen , may be the best vocal jazz album i have ever heard ( i say have heard because i 've only listened to maybe fifteen albums in the genre ) . by just destroying any credentials i had in the previous statement , lets move on to the review . this is a west coast jazz classic , truly one of the most overlooked outputs of the cool school of jazz . while not as technically competant as `` kind of blue '' , i manage to listen to it just as much , if not more . every song included on this disc is a classic standard , and baker 's version of `` my funny valentine '' is the greatest version of the song , beating out sinatra 's rendition by a mile . the instrumentation itself is flawless , as mr. baker 's trumpet playing guides the band . he was as adept at the trumpet as he was at singing . the low-key and minimalist style of the band is perfect for the songs , and is one of the best bands in jazz history . influential and flawless , this is a must-have for any fan of post-war jazz
