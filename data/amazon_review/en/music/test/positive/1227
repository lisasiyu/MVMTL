1990 : 10 years into maidens career.. content start to crack . records 'iron maiden ' through '7th son ' were incredible to me ! then came npftd , same cool art , content tho started to drop-off . many of these tracks are simply sub-par & boring . 1- tailgunner- nice , upbeat , moving , enjoyable . 2- holy smoke- not exactly the excellent style of im but still not too bad . 3- no prayer for the dying- eh , slow but speeds up with classic maiden electric duets 4- public enema number one- nothing groundbreaking here but fast & true to old content 5- fates warning -boring ! long slow intro & should have not made it to release . poor ! 6- the assassin - slightly better than average . 7- running silent , running deep- filler although.. the solo 's are really nice 8- hooks in you- nice , could have fit well on their debut with d'anno 9- bring your daughter ... to the slaughter - not my type of material . never liked it . 10 . mother russia- dont really like it till the end where is really changes into a fast guitar fest . overall not that bad.. the follow-up fear of the dark was a clear step down & then after that they hit rock bottom & have not come back . x-factor to matter of life & death are just a near complete collapse of decent writing .
