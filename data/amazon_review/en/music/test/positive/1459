but it for 'frances the mute' like pete said , frances the mute is supposed to be the first song of the album by the same title . i wondered whether getting a cd single would be worth it just for the one song ( since i already had the widow from ftm the album ) , and after hearing it , i do n't think i could listen to the full album again without starting off with the ftm song . it seems that critical to the album . it starts off with about 4 and a half minutes of what sounds like metal clanging , like prison bars or something , then picks up with the main part of the song , simple but powerful . when that ends after a few minutes , you get a few minutes of very slow , quiet beautifully depressing and haunting section and then builds for the grand finale to the song and drifts into the opening ftm the album where `` the ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens '' picks up . trust me , for hardcore fans , this is essential . if anything , download . you need this
