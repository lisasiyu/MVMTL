5 stars is not enought ... i own every danzig-era misfits release and to me this is hands down the best one of them all . a solid album with 17 awesome tracks plus a bonus track of studio screw ups . every song on here is a great listen plus the sound quality isnt that bad compared to his other recordings . there are alot of reviews claiming walk among us is there defining masterpiece but i disagree ; its great but not as great as static age
