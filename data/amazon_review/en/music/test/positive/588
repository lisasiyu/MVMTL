eric manages to get through the hurricane eric 's third effort is six years in the making . i noticed that the only time a artist brings us some good music to the table is when their life 's in shambles . but , without pain there 's no way for us humans to channel that hurt without a medium . eric channels all that was tumultuous in his life into this wonderfully orchestrated album . many artists tend to use one musician to lay all tracks through synthesizers , moog programs , drum machines and consoles which in a way makes the consumer lose focus on the real content of the disc . majority of the disc is mostly based on self reflection . he 's made bad choices outside of his music career , but in this disc , he shows us that he finally got it together . be myself is a self reflective piece on finding his true soul and sticking with it . pretty baby is a personal fave due to the sensual background vocals . the song also is a anthem for women to get it together and stop giving out the goods without showing some self respect for themselves . hurricane is another reflective piece that says to come and take the pain away and let him live the life that he feels he so richly deserve . i wan na be loved is a cry that says he want to be loved by that special woman . the rest of the disc is good . the cabaret infused track the last time totally throws off the sexy vibe , but everyone has an off quirky moment . nevertheless , it 's a solid affair with just the right amount of angst , but enough self loving prose that clearly shines through and through . grade : a
