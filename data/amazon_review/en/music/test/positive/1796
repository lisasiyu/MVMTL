still standing when asked , nearly every oasis fan i know will say that morning glory , or definitely maybe are oasis ' best albums . while both are very good , i 'd have to say that this one is the album i 'd have to go with for my personal favorite . do n't believe the truth is tied with this one for me . there 's just something here that it seems like oasis have always been trying to block up with pure attitude and drug-fueled anthems . this is the sober , matured oasis who are left in the aftermath of their dreams come true , to be rock'n'roll stars , standing on the shoulders of the lives they created , with nowhere to go but down . although the band was off drinking and drugs while making this album , ironically it is their most psychedelic and foggy effort . there are some of oasis 's weakest tracks on this one `` put yer money where yer mouth is '' , and `` i can see a liar '' , but there are also some of oasis 's best like `` roll it over '' . though this is by no means their strongest album , it is by far their most honest , and instrospective work to date . it 's the sound of the gallaghers turning away from rough attitude , and facing life head-on
