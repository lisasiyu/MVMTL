a defining moment in '90 's punk the brilliance of the work on the early bad religion albums ( suffer , no control and against the grain ) is that it manages to be simultaneously delicate yet undeniably coarse . in terms of the lyrics , they ca n't get much more intricate , and yet they retain a hardened edge laced with a characteristically punk sense of discontent , which makes for a perfect balance . vocally and musically the bad religion of against the grain are far more raw than they are they are currently , but there is still a sharpness which ensures that their raw edge does not make them come across as simply sloppy . highlights include anesthesia - with brett doing what he does best and delving fearlessly into realm of the deeply troubled individual , and greg furiously spitting social criticisms via his seamless polysyllabic approach in get off and quality and quantity . god song is another gem which sits comfortably in the company of other bad religion tracks questioning the nature of religion , such as chimaera and generator , which are arguably some of their most effective songs . it 's inconceivable that the boys will once again achieve the kind of punk perfection they did with this album , ( and with generator and stranger than fiction ) so no self-respecting punk should hesitate buying a copy of against the grain . it is a classic which effectively helped to define the genre of 90 's punk rock
