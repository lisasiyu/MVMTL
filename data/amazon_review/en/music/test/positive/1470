rediscovering rick if you are looking to relive some favorite tunes from the past , `` the day after yesterday '' by rick springfield is a good one ! ! ! however , if you are looking for `` jessie 's girl '' and `` do n't talk to strangers , '' this one is not for you . although this offering differs greatly from much of springfield 's most popular tunes , i like it ! ! ! as a fan rediscovering rick , i appreciate what his mature voice lends to each cut . this album helps to confirm my belief that musicians ( just like everyone else ) should change and grow , take divergent paths , explore , rediscovery , etc . and not stay the same - play the same tunes in the same old way . rick 's last album , `` shock/denial/anger/acceptance , '' contains many raw and hard-hitting tracks . this one does not . take it for what it is - he is not selling it as anything but songs that he wished he had written . i appreciate the various offerings by an artist over his/her career span ( buy this one and `` anthology -written in rock '' released in 2005 and `` karma '' in 1999 to see what i mean ) .
