one of his best ever there and back was a change of pace for jeff beck . his sound became more electronic . this is a departure of his previous albums , blow by blow and wired . personally this along with blow by blow and jeff beck 's guitar shop are my three favorte jeff beck albums ever . the two songs on this cd that will open your ears and get your attention are , star cycle . the entire album is worth the price of the cd . star cycle is not only great guitar but great keyboard as well . the combination of the two is outstanding . the pump is also on this album . the pump is probably in my top 5 for the best jeff beck songs ever . jeff beck uses distortion in much the same way jimi hendrix used it to augment his guitar style . no jeff beck collection is complete without this album . this is my mind is one of the outstanding albums in rock history . jeff beck is a master guitarist and this cd will show you why
