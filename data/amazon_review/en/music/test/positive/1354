all day and all night you can listen to this set when the wailers were signed to island records in 1972 , this marked the beginning of reggae to an international audience . the wailers were already famous throughout the carribbean , but worldwide they were nobody 's . catch a fire changed all that . this was packaged as a rock album and the original album sleeve was actually a zippo lighter and when you opened the lighter the record would come out . this artwork is not original . the sound tapes were actually overdubbed with rock giutars and other instruments to make this album appeal to an american and english audience . the first disc is all the original jamaican takes which are better then the overdubbed ones released originally to the world in 1972 . the original mixes have such a feel to them , and you can really appreciate why this band was so big in the carribbean . the wailers first album has a feel unlike any other bob marley , peter tosh , or bunny wailer solo album . the three of them together were simply amazing and no vocal trio will ever equal how good this band was . with the barrett brothers on drums and bass and a young tyrone downie on the keyobards , this band was well on the path to stardom , and catch a fire was the start . if you have a music collection , you need this deluxe edition in your collection
