best album ever this is the best album ever . rainbow gets heavier and faster on this album and just improve overall . dio 's vocals are out of this world and blackmore 's guitar playing is incredible . every song on the album is a masterpeice . tarot woman is a fast power metal fantasy song , run with the wolf is a slower fantasy song , starstruck is a fast neo classical song , do you close your eyes is a radio friendly rock song with a catchy riff and catchy chorus , stargazer is an epic , power metal , neo classical metal masterpeice and the best song i 've ever heard , a light in tbe black is another epic power metal song which continues the stargazer story execpt much faster this time , there are 2 long solos one is a keyboard solo and one is a guitar solo . stargazer is the best song i 've ever heard and the rest are classics aswell . every musician on this album contributes there best performances ever on this album . this is by far the best album i 've ever heard . fans of rainbow , deep purple , iron maiden , black sabbath , led zeppelin , elf , dio , stratovarius , yngwie malmsteen , hammerfall and metal and rock in general will love this as you can see from the other reviews
