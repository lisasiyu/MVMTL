country singer vince uses orchestra for christmas album vince , with is high tenor voice , is one of the finest singers that country music has ever poroduced - however , this album is not a country album . it is a wonderful christmas album that should appeal to fans of easy-listening music by the likes of andy williams and others . this was vince 's second christmas album and ( like the first ) vince sticks mainly to famous songs , being careful to avoid those that he included on his earlier album ( let there be peace on earth ) . the only unusual songs here are the title track ( written by amy grant , who eventually married him and who has recorded three brilliant christmas albums of her own ) , it 's the most wonderful time of the year ( which does n't appear on christmas albums as often as it deserves ) and a cradle in bethlehem ( another excellent song that could do with greater exposure ) . vince is in superb voice throughout with the orchestra providing tasteful backing on every track . so , once you get over any initial surprise at hearing vince supported by an orchestra instead of nashville musicians , this album is exactly what you 'd expect - brilliant
