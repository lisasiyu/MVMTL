excellent soundtrack this is an excellent soundtrack . pmg show another side of their musical journey with a more atmoshperic and emotionnal journey . if only every soundtrack were this good . one big surprise that i encountered while listenign to this album is the lack of solos , but this lack works really well , the atmosphere is what sings to you on this album unlike previous metheny albums . reccomended to fans of atmospheric and laid-back music . if you 're debating on this purchase , buy it right away , you will not regret
