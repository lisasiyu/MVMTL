cool does n't necessarily mean tepid for those of you who ( unfairly ) criticize this latest effort by the vastly underappreciated teenage fanclub as being lackluster , i wish to offer a different interpretation . yes it is a subdued and carefully-produced effort , in keeping with their later work rather than the bandwagonesque-era looseness and feedback-drenched big star rock . but it is not without soul or passion . it is simply a more relaxed record , more sculpted , more careful . the music still flows nicely , the lyrics are stronger than usual , and hooks abound . just about every song has worthwhile aspects anda high level of attention to detail . it is obvious to me that the band put a lot into this one , from picking a new producer to writing a collection of grade-a material . why only 4 stars then ? well , bandwagonesque is classic , and a high , high bar was set way back when . if this came from anyone else , maybe 5 stars would be more in line . for those of you who are new to fanclub and have stumbled onto this page by accident , let me tell you , you have to buy either the best-of collection or bandwagonesque , or both . really . then you will want all the rest . i cheered when nirvana kicked michael jackson off the charts in 1991 or whenever that was , but i would have cheered far more if fanclub had subsequently booted nirvana from those charts . it could have happened- for all the cobain-tragedy publicity , fanclub writes better songs . this band has been quietly and unpretetiously chugging along since 1990 at least , while nobody seems to really notice . give them your support , they are a treasure
