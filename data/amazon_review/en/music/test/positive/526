wowwowwowwow this is the first cd that i have bought this year and been completely blown away . everything on this album is awesome . i have n't taken it out of my cd player since i picked it up on tuesday . these guys are primed to blow up ! i ca n't wait to see them play live it 's going to be great . anyways the whole cd is great . i love the crunchy guitars and heavy drumming . i ca n't believe how amazing this band is . congrats are in order to metal blade for getting these guys . the band reminds me of an early killswitch engage right before their second album took off . i really expect similar things from ws . to think that this album is as good as it is is surprising . i remember hearing these guys on a compliation and not thinking all that highly of them , but after getting a sample mp3 on metal blade 's website i decided i had to get this cd and i have n't been disappointed . this album should be on everyone 's radar in the next couple of months , just watch . it took kse 's second album a little while to catch on but once it did , boom , it blew up . just rest assured knowing that you had this album way before anyone else if you 're smart enough to pick this up asap .
