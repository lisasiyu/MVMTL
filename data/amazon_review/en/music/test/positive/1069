when annie bares it all ... i 've been a fan of annie for quite a while , and this album sticks to me the most other than her previous releases ( do n't know if it 's because this is the first album of annie that i 've bought , or because i have personal recollection to this album -- maybe both.. ) anyway , i have to say that this album is a rare album to be found in nowadays highly commercialized music industry . in this album ( which sadly is annie 's most unknown/unheard album ) , annie lennox sheds her deepest soul and her truths , unabashedly . i can understand why a lot of people dislike/hate this album while they are fans of `` diva '' ... this album ai n't no `` diva '' ... annie 's life has changed throughout the 11 years span between the relase of `` diva '' and `` bare '' , so it 's kind of funny to me people hating this record because annie is considered to be `` a whining 50-years-old woman '' ( how cruel , is n't it ? ) what 's more personal is that lennox wrote all the tracks herself , making this a highly original , innovative , fresh yet revealing and honest record..gone are the 80's/90 's synthesizer sounds , replaced by keyboards-oriented sounds . all the tracks are about being hurt/sad yet also surrendering like the melodic `` a thousand beautiful things '' , `` the saddest song i 've got '' ( indeed , her saddest song ) , the wonderfully layered `` honestly '' and the dance influenced `` bitter pill '' her anger and pain can be seen on songs like `` pavement cracks '' , `` erased '' and `` twisted '' where on `` the hurting time '' annie gets wise with the lyrics : `` so tell me what they day brings/ has it lost its thrill ? / are you still searching , hoping for that empty space to fill ? / and everything you turn to / is like a mirror on the shelf/ and the one that you 're blaming is yourself.. '' wrapped in jazzy sounds , creating a highly spiritual listening . `` loneliness '' is the return to the 80 's rock sounds , with heart wrenching lyrics : `` i 've got a longing that 's hard to find/wo n't give me no peace of mind/something that i 've lived with all along/days and weeks and months and years/ filling in the time my dear/ but somehow i still keep on going strong '' , where we can see her sadness but also willing to be strong , facing the truth . the last track , `` oh god ( prayer ) '' , is a short sad song , filled with questions to god , soaring her pain : `` if you can see me/ if you can hear me/ i know that i ca n't be that strong/ 'cause everything i ever did went wrong '' ... all that being said , this is the album that you will listen to over and over again while going through a rough time ... it 's about releasing your pain , sadness and anger , and also willing to be strong again ... listening to this album is not just listening , it 's an experience which we can relate to and learn from
