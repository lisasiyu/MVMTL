the beginning of the end i have been an ac/dc fan for more than 20 years now . i have all the albums . and looking back , it seems like this was the last solid one they made . this one is not nearly as good as back in black , or even highway to hell . no , at this point the band was not working as hard to crank out good material . i 'm thinking that is why producer mutt lange bowed out after this record . he did the previous 2 records , and every song on those was great . here , `` snowballed , '' `` inject the venom , '' and others are clearly filler material . that is too bad , too , because brian johnson still had a voice on this record . if you have heard him sing anytime since 1986 he sounds hoarse . if you want to hear the young brothers at their best , get powerage , highway to hell , and back in black . every ac/dc record since then falls short of those .
