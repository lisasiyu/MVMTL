way ahead of it 's time if you need a quick introduction to amon duul ii this is the album for you .the album showcases amon duul at their best and with the best line up and with a great set of songs.other amon duul ii albums have long tracks and improvisations that take a while to get into .this is one of my favorite albums of all time .the live version of archangels thunderbird is just awesom
