i like it my parents loved john so i am familiar to a degree with his music and the special sound of his voice . i think this cd sounds good and i like the selection of songs . what else can one say ? you like it or you do n't for one reason or another . i like it and listen to it and that 's just me . enjoy what we are given and what remains
