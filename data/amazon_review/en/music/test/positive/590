a whole lotta soul okay , first i need to respond to a previous reviewer who gave this cd one star and stated ... `` she loves you~ twilight singers is the kind of music that i detest . it is wordy and pretentious and sounds like the lyrics are written to annoy rather then for the audience to enjoy . '' `` she loves you '' , as clearly stated by most of the reviews here and amazon 's description of this cd , is an album of cover tunes . meaning , all songs writen by other people . so your complaining about the verbosity of greg dulli in a review for this cd is ... well ... dumb . upon investigation into your previous reviews i noticed you gave 5 stars to a nick cave cd which is surprising because nick can be pretty verbose and often times pretentious . bottom line , if you are here to talk trash about somebody at least listen to the cd first and be honest about it . that being said ... greg dulli shows some pretty serious ambition with his choice of covers on `` she loves you '' including the oddball `` hyperballad '' , the billie holiday classic `` strange fruit '' , and fleetwood mac 's `` what makes you think you 're the one '' . onlike most cover albums , dulli does n't just pay lip service to the originals , he applies his unique soulfull paintbrush to each and makes them his own . most cover cds are bad ... this one is n't . it 's really , really good . buy it .
