great turntablism this is the best effort put together by these boys.the album has a steady pace that never gets odd like alot of turntable albums out there.i have alot of these types of albums and this one is one of the best.great emcees grace the album here and there and the beats stay raw and the scratching sounds unrehearsed to give it a basement sound.i would not put my name on here recommending junk.this is hip hop.in its purest form.all of my recommendations will satisfy the hardcore.50 cent fans dont even check.my list will not apply to you
