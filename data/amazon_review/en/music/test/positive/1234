ella and louis sing of life as we know it -- and wow , how i appreciate the ride ! ! ! on this cd ella and louis armstrong join forces to make an album that is pure magic . they 've been lovingly teased as satin ( ella ) and sandpaper ( louis , because of his gravelly voice ) ; but no duo compares to them when they sing together . louis and ella obviously enjoyed making this recording ; their voices are in excellent form and impart a certain sense of genuine happiness that is hard to find . ella and louis have voices that are rich , vibrant and full of electricity ! this cd proves it . the cd starts off with the charming and playful `` let 's call the whole thing off . '' the album then switches gears and goes into the more soulful love ballad entitled `` our love is here to stay . '' sublime ! other great songs on this cd include `` stars fell on alabama ; '' `` the nearness of you ; '' `` stompin ' at the savoy ; '' and `` tenderly . '' louis performs great trumpet solos on songs including `` tenderly '' and `` summertime '' that make your heart melt . in fact , every song is special on this cd ; i also admire their rendition of `` under a blanket of blue . '' the musical arrangements are very well done . these tracks feature several great opportunities for us to enjoy armstrong 's trumpet solos . the liner notes impress me , too . there is an adaptation of an essay by william ruhlmann who wrote the liner notes for the complete ella and louis on verve . there are beautiful photos of ella and louis ; and you get the song credits , too . a nice plus ! overall , the chemistry between ella fitzgerald and louis armstrong makes for an experience that is truly in its own league . they enjoy their work and it shows . you will appreciate their energy and powerful renditions of these wonderful songs . i highly recommend this cd for fans of classic pop vocals and fans of both ella and louis . this is also a great budget priced cd for people who want to know if they will like this style of music . moreover , if you do like this cd i suggest you listen to the cd box set entitled the complete ella fitzgerald & louis armstrong and another cd entitled ella and louis again . you can also try solo cds by both ella fitzgerald and louis armstrong ; they produced great music individually as well . you truly ca n't go wrong with this classic cd ; and i hope this cd brings you the same joy and thrills that ella and louis communicate when they perform these magnificent songs . enjoy ! ! !
