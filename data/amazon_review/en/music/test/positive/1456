containing the monster on r.e.m . 's previous two albums , out of time & automatic for the people , the band created quiet classics by employing a wide array of beautiful instruments including mandolins , harpsichords , strings and the like . they did a complete 180 on monster , which is anything but quiet . the album is steeped in the glam-rock of the 70 's and the grunge music of its day . peter buck threw away the acoustic stuff , plugged in and turned the volume up to 11 . the band shows off their musical aptitude as this album sounds like nothing they 've done before or since . `` what 's the frequency , kenneth ? '' opens the album awash in buzzing guitars and undesciprable michael stipe vocals . `` crush with eyeliner '' is a glam-rock classic and sounds like it could be out of the david bowie songbook . `` i do n't sleep , i dream '' is a pulsating track while `` star 69 '' is straight ahead , tongue-in-cheek rocker . `` tongue '' is probably the band 's sexiest song done in a bump and grind style . `` let me in '' is their tribute to the late kurt cobain . `` bang and blame '' is the best song on the album , with its synthesized sound and popping guitars . monster was the band 's first album to debut at number one and with it , they continued to push the envelope and shake up their identity . this album really benefits from the 5.1 audio as the original album is full of buzzing guitars & distortion and the mix makes for a richer sound
