incredible . buy it now ! i agree with other reviewers who wonder how anybody could give this less than 5 stars . this album sticks with you over time as few can . it is like listening to a psyche explode into madness , from the tight grip of `` schizophrenia '' to the noise that builds with `` kotton krown '' and continues through the chaos of `` white dick . '' i recommend this as somewhat of a sy apostate . i admit that i listen to goo more than evol , and have defended goo even in heated exchanges with random strangers in bars . it seems that daydream nation is the watershed moment ( read `` sell out '' ) for most `` true '' sy fans and i was surprised to see sister and dn linked in so many of these amazon reviews . they are completely different , and if you though dn was experimental , maybe you should not go back any further in the sy catalogue . avoid sister . i also agree with reviewers who tout this as far superior to most `` indie '' or non-indie music for that matter . there is an authenticity here , as with all sy , that one does n't find anymore , an attitude about making music as art without regard for sales or singles or airplay ( even on the `` classic alternative '' stations popping up in socal and soon to be exported to your suburb ) . you listen to sister and you understand how pervasive sy is in their influence , from the pixies to nirvana to the white stripes , it do n't exist without early sy . not to say that bands copy sy , it 's just that their music , exemplified by this record , is infectious and so deeply layered in sound and attitude that , like vu before them , it would be hard not to show some influence . if you are new to sy and want a great starter album , sister is where to go , then buy evol and daydream nation , move toward the fine work from the early 90s ( goo , dirty , experimental jet set ... ) and on to murray street
