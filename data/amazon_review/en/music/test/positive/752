one of my favorite kid 's albums so far ... what a fun album ! my 18 month old boogies like crazy to these tunes -- and they are varied enough and laced with some grown up humor that i do n't want to run from the room hearing it over and over . it does n't have thay syrupy sweet sound found in so many kids ' albums . try it - you wo n't regret it
