on the way to graceland ... i took my wife and parents to the grand ole opry in october 2003 , just after this album was released . rlh sang two songs , a funny one about breaking up with a boyfried and `` forgive '' . when she belted out that ballad , i turned to my wife and said , `` she 's gon na be a huge star one day . '' after the show , of course , we stopped in the gift shop and grabbed the cd . good stuff .
