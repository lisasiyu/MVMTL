the vintner 's reserve blues fron the heart of montana . the music on this album is the vintner 's reserve . phil making music for phil , and then sharing it with the rest of us at just the right time . this album is all phil , all piano , and very , very good . phil say 's in the liner notes , `` the blues is simple soul music with room to get your name up '' . simple for him , but this vintner 's reserve is delightfully complex in flavors for the listener and subtle in style and performance from tune to tune . soul music it is , from the heart to nourish the soul . does he get his name up ? you bet ! i think this is phil 's best album yet . but then again , who can make that claim when thinking of `` cinema '' or `` upright '' or `` a wild christmas '' or `` live ! from montana '' or `` high plains '' or - all of his other timeless tunes produced over the years and on record labels past and present ? if you have n't heard philip aaberg 's music ; from his hideout ( sweetgrass music label ) near the sweetgrass hills in north central montana , or if you have n't listened to him lately , then it 's time to take `` that train '' and `` fourteen dollars '' and head west , blue west !
