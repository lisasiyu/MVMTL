exciting , moving , beautiful , energetic , heart-felt , fantastic ... what more can i add ? cecilia bartoli just `` does it '' for me almost every time . she is just fantastic in my books . i love her dearly . she can give one an adrenalin rush with her bravura singing and then break one 's heart with her pathos . this is a superb collection of baroque arias from `` almost '' operas ! ; - ) ) i also liked the cheeky and none-too-subtle references to la dolce vita on cover and the images inside the disc . nice to see an opera singer with a playful sense of humour ! i am listening to this disc as i write this review and all i can say is that i love this disc and it is clearly one of the best signorina bartoli has released , although i like all of her recordings . listen to track 12 and you will buy this disc . more , please ! ps : how about decca getting cecilia bartoli and andreas scholl together for a musical project ? i 'd love to see two of my favourite singers together on the one disc . psps : if you like opera proibita , buy andreas scholl 's arcadia and arias for senesino , too !
