scott 's review [ jassiel2001 @ hotmail.com ] commissioned . one of the greatest groups of all time . really gives it to you with this album . with lush flowing ballads such as , & quot ; do you still love me & quot ; and , & quot ; crucified with christ. & quot ; this album also gives you bangin ' joints such as , & quot ; irreplaceable love & quot ; and , & quot ; i can love agin. & quot ; this cd gives you all that you need , and will really help you with your walk with christ . this is the year 2001 , and i still rate this album ( done in 1996 ) number one out of all my music i have at home . in church or out of church , i encurage you to buy this album . you wont be disapointed
