nearly the ultimate edition of classic album & quot ; the kinks are the village green preservation society & quot ; appeared and disappeared with nary a trace when it was first released in 1968 . overshadowed by & quot ; the white album & quot ; ( the beatles ) , beggar 's banquet ( the stones ) and other major releases , it seemed horribly out of step with its time when it was first released . that 's because , as was often the case with the kinks , it was . & quot ; village green & quot ; preceded the move back to the pastoral sounds and eagerness to recapture the innocence of the past by about twenty years . it sounds surprisingly fresh and vital now even if some the production occasionally sounds dated . that only adds to its charm . now expanded to fill three cds ( as it should have been when castle/essential remastered and re-released the album a couple of years ago ) , & quot ; village green & quot ; has never sounded so great and so complete . while it has a few glaring omissions ( most notably & quot ; she 's got everything & quot ; which davies did n't really want on this album along with a couple of other tracks that were originally slated for but withdrawn from the finished line up ) , this is about as complete a representation as were going to get of the material recorded during the 1966-1968 time frame when & quot ; village green & quot ; was recorded . lovingly restored and remastered under the supervision of andrew sandoval ( how does andy get all these great jobs ? ) with remastering done by the magical bill inglot and dan hirsch at digiprep , & quot ; village green & quot ; sparkles and sounds the best it ever has on cd . disc one focuses on the original stereo version of the album . a better sounding version of this edition has never appeared before ( although the japanese k2 remaster sounded pretty darn close ) . we also get bonus tracks featuring a single a side from the time & quot ; days & quot ; and the stereo alternate mixes that appeared on the withdrawn 12 track edition of & quot ; village green & quot ; . we & quot ; mr. songbird & quot ; ( stereo version ) as well . disc two features the mono version of the album . since the mixes differ slightly , hardcore kinks fans will want both versions . on the mono version we also get bonus tracks as well including the mono version of & quot ; mr. songbird & quot ; , & quot ; polly & quot ; , & quot ; wonderboy & quot ; , & quot ; berkeley mews & quot ; and a no strings version ( the earliest from 1966 ) of & quot ; village green & quot ; to close out the cd . disc three is the one that will have fans salivating . the & quot ; rarities & quot ; disc as it 's subtitled features a number of tracks previously unavailable ( offically and unoffically ) on cd plus tracks that have never been released . we get the following stereo & quot ; rarities & quot ; ; & quot ; misty water & quot ; ( and also the mono version which has n't been released before ) , & quot ; berkeley mews & quot ; , & quot ; easy come ( previously unreleased on cd ) , there you went & quot ; , & quot ; polly & quot ; , & quot ; animal farm & quot ; ( alternate stereo mix previously unreleased ) , & quot ; johnny thunder & quot ; ( an alternate stereo remix ) , & quot ; did you see his name & quot ; , & quot ; mick avory 's underpants & quot ; ( an instrumental previously unreleased ) , & quot ; lavender hill & quot ; , & quot ; rosemary rose & quot ; , & quot ; wonderboy & quot ; , & quot ; spotty grotty anna & quot ; , & quot ; where did my spring go ? & quot ; , & quot ; groovy movies & quot ; , & quot ; creeping jean & quot ; ( and unreleased longer , stereo mix ) , & quot ; king kong & quot ; . we also get the following mono tracks including & quot ; misty water & quot ; , & quot ; do you remember walter & quot ; ( a bbc session remix ) , & quot ; animal farm ( a bbc sesion remix ) , & quot ; days & quot ; ( a bbc session remix ) and & quot ; phenomenal cat & quot ; ( a mono instrumental mix ) . a note on the & quot ; rarities & quot ; -- many of these were previously available on & quot ; the great lost kinks album & quot ; and on bootlegs but never with sound this good . also , the bbc sessions are , like many from the time , the instrumental backing with some new vocals dubbed on . they do n't sound significantly different from the original versions but collectors will want them . the deluxe packaging features a booklet with new comments from ray , dave , pete and mick on the making of the album and various tracks . we also get a discussion on the genesis and difficulties that the album faced . sandoval also co-authors a brief synposis with info drawn from doug hinman 's excellent book on the kinks that discusses when the various recordings were made , differences between them and the process of putting together the album . & quot ; village green & quot ; is presented in a deluxe digipak accordian fold out sleeve . sure , it 's missing a few key album tracks but , really , this is as good as it gets when dealing with the corporate world and the compromises of reissuing classic albums .
