great album , but not my favorite i 'm a huge fan of edwin mccain , i 've had all his albums at least twice ( i end up losing them since i take them everywhere ) . this album is certainly not a disappointment . many of the songs will strike an emotional chord in the deepest of us , others are just good fun to listen to . there is more rock and roll style songs on this than many fans will be used to , but they 're all a blast to listen to . `` write me a song '' and `` i 've seen love '' are my favorites from this one . there are also a couple satirical songs - much like `` beautiful life '' from 'messenger . though 'messenger ' is still my favorite mccain album , i would never pass this one up . there is no reason why any edwin mccain fan would not like this one
