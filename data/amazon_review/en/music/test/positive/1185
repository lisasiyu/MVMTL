this is a really good cd ! ! ! ! i love this cd ! since i am reading the book and have watched several movies , this musical means a lot to me . when i finally relized who was singing this and who was singing that and why they were singing it etc , etc , i enjoyed it even more ! at once , i put it on my ipod and listen to it constantly . jean valjean is my favourite singer on this cd . but then , of course , he is my favorite character of all times in the book . i espeicialy like the songs `` bring him home '' and `` what have i done ? '' the one song i do n't care for is the final song . i know this sounds silly , but i cry almost every time i hear it . eponine is my second favorite . well , she ties with enjrolas that is . if i were to be in this musical i would like to play her part . her voice is strong but soft at the same time . of all the songs she sings , i like `` a little fall of rain '' the best . enjrolas is really good too . this would bring me to more of my favorite songs . `` red and black '' and `` do you hear the people sing ? '' my final conclusion must be this : i love this cd . please , if buy this cd , cherish it . it had greatly impacted my life . this cd is great ! you can see just what i 'm talking about ! perhaps this feeling that this is the best musical only belongs to me . but then again ... ... ... ... .
