so good man , this is a great record it moves and grooves and just suits you like a long motorcycle drive or a nice fitting glove . just kidding i do n't ride motorcycles , but this music just makes me dance crazy with a pocketful full of soul . it ca n't be helped how it revs the motor of your mind to jump on a motorcycle but the music is your engine , moving along the road and laughing the whole way cause the ride 's fast and nothing stops it till you crash or run out of gas
