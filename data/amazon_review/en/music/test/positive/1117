beautiful , heavenly , blissful music ten stars ! ! everyone who has a baby should have this music ! it is especially wonderful for babies with health problems . my son was an absolutely miserable baby due to undiagnosed reflux . 24/7 , if he was n't nursing , he was screaming . i first played this music for him when he was six weeks old . he immediately stopped screaming and the most blissful , peaceful look came over his face as he listened to the heartbeat sound he remembered from his time before birth . when i was pregnant , i had always worried that he was lonely in there , but now i know that unborn children still have one foot in heaven , because i could see that peace and bliss on his face as he remembered . it was wonderful to finally have a way to soothe him and i was so thankful for the music . i used the music very often . when he had to have surgery at 4 months of age , we took this music to the hospital and after his operation we played it in his room all night long to keep him settled down . the nurse taking care of him normally worked in the nicu , and he said they played this same music for the very sick and premature babies and the in the nicu because it helps to keep them calm and happy .
