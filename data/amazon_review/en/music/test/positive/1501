a classic ! faith no more , classic melodies , eternal tunes , quirky lyrics angel dust for sure ! songs i never get tired of hearing , even after years and years . mike patton is a complicated one-man orchestra not out ther for to make the easily digestible . subtle musical intricacies and weaving insrtuments , i hear something new every time . composition wise , i 'd rank him up there with mozart . a few songs fall a little short , but where they 're on , they 're very on
