third in a five star series the rushing , lush & quot ; love song & quot ; by ronan hardiman opens this set with gorgeous vocals and celtic influences over pop beats . & quot ; rushing & quot ; by moby is a laid-back groove with simple piano melodies on top . a sensuous female vocal is the centerpiece of balligomingo 's & quot ; lost & quot ; , and the multi-layered instrumentation over a dance beat make this a prime cut off this cd . thomas newman 's & quot ; lunch with the king & quot ; is taken from the & quot ; american beauty & quot ; soundtrack , and fits the scene it was taken from perfectly . it 's a differently-themed piece . pilgramage 's & quot ; through the seas of life & quot ; has some beautiful religious-themed vocals running through this up-tempo groove . electronically cut together vocals detract from the pure danceability of govinda 's & quot ; aspetta & quot ; , especially with a lively fiddle melody that weaves in and out . & quot ; the garden & quot ; by faithless is a musical soundscape that combines new age , electronica and pop to create a danceable groove yet retain the new age feel . the jazzy & quot ; blue skies & quot ; by soma sonic is very trip-hop like , and includes high ethereal female vocals occasionally layered on top . ikarus ' & quot ; bassment & quot ; almost sounds like a fatboy slim record with male chanting on top . this track is n't one of the better ones . & quot ; peaceful village & quot ; brings japanese influences to new-age pop by way of yasue , and does it well . a deep groove with vocals that weave in and out in a jazzy way is the trademark of phobos ' & quot ; soul of desire & quot ; , a simply beautiful relaxing track . the sprit of eden and davy spillane team up on & quot ; the sun and the moon and the stars & quot ; , another track with an electronic beat and heavy celtic influences . lovely to listen to on a windy day . dagda is electronic trance music with celtic melodies on top , and while similar things have been done before , they do it very well . their track , & quot ; shades of the otherworld & quot ; stands out here and dagda should be a group to watch . clair marlo 's & quot ; celtic groove & quot ; is exactly what it says it is , and it is also done very well . another artist to watch . alkaemy 's & quot ; enchantment & quot ; ends this disc , and does so in a laid-back fashion . a very subdued beat with celtic mystic influences make this a beautiful closer for the cd . yet another winner for elevation
