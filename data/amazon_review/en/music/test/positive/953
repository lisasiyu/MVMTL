and this is the message from the ruler rick crew this cd is a classic . to this day ( as was the case at a cousin 's wedding reception recently in charlotte , nc ) , the likes of `` children 's story '' and `` the moment i feared '' can still pack dance floors nearly 20 years later . overall , this is one of the best rap cds of all time . ricky `` slick rick '' walters was/is the uncrowned king ( well , since he was also known as `` rick the ruler '' , maybe he was crowned ) of rap storytelling . this is one of the few rap cds that are as much fun to listen to as well as dance from . he was a brilliant , creative , and imaginative lyricist and rhymester with his unique style , and no two songs on this cd are lyrically or musically alike . he was one of the few who took full advantage of the format of rap to tell some really interesting stories that took listeners to another level . the one downnote is that rick sends some really mixed messages here . while `` children 's story '' and the lovely `` hey young world '' as well as `` teenage love '' has our hero laying down some pretty positive stuff for his younger fans , there 's also the negativity and misogyny of `` treat her like a prostitute '' , '' indian girl , '' and `` lick the ( you get the idea ) '' that foreshadowed the lows that nwa and future rappers would take along this dark line . in another ugly sign of things to come , rick 's publicized imprisonment ( from a case eerily similar to `` children 's story '' ) stifled his future output and stalled a great career ( as would be the case with many future , albeit less talented , rappers ) it would be nice if he were to record with his onetime partner and fellow storyteller dana dane of the unrecorded kangol krew of the early 80s . now that would be an amazing record ( they appeared together only once in recent years to my knowledge in a film perfroming with rick 's later partner doug e. fresh ) . but we can be thankful for what 's here and enjoy it for what it is . the title fits . good night
