the only current pop band i like ! most music i listen to would n't sound anything like this . my idea of a good time is listening to mogwai at full volume or bumping hip hop with a lot of bass . of montreal are incredible . the bass lines are ridiculously funky . i did n't think i liked this cd as much as their other work , but after listening to it 10 times i ca n't get it out of my head . i usually prefer lyrics that are n't as literal as this , but it works really well . there 's so many good songs 'but which one do i , do i cho-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oose ' . really , i do n't know what the best song is , because all of the songs are either a 9-10 . 'gronladic edit ' is nothing short of brilliant . the transistion from tracks 2 and 3 is one of my favorite moments . handclaps cheesy ? i think not ! this music puts me in a really good mood . and it 's psychedelic in the best way possible . it 's like listening to i do n't know , the cars/beach boys/zappa/beatles/dust brothers at the same time .
