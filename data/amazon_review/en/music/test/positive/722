tres belle i do n't speak a word of french beyond tourist phrase-book niceties . i discovered this album when i was an undergraduate , in the undergrad listening library at the university of washington ( seattle ) . i love the sound . still do . my music tastes range from metallica to vivaldi to the carter family , and this album has its own special niche in my heart .
