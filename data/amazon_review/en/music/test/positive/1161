building a better guitar in the end of the 90s , some bands and guitar players decided to explore new grounds of music . some of these attempts was successful , some were not . good examples of artists that tried to sound modern was the german rock band scorpions ( eyeiieye ) , steve vai ( sex & religion ) , jeff beck ( who else ! , you had it coming , jeff ) and of course , joe satriani . in a particular boarding , mr. satch saw the rising experiments from genius guitar player and inspiration jeff beck and decided to make an attempt into a more electronic kind of music . now , the difference between beck and satch is that satch was creative , bold and concise in his boarding , and jeff , well , lost himself in the path . do n't get me wrong , i love jeff beck from his yardbirds/tridents days to beckology , he was truly a great genius , egomaniac , but genius , comparable only with jimi hendrix . but jeff 's techno sound is boring , noisy and truly out of place . he affirmed himself that his techno albums is among the worst ones ever produced by him . joe satriani , in a kind of inspired mood and brilliance knew very well how to create his chops without sacrifice the music . he created a balance between him , his human band and the pro-tools . he sounds fantastic in this release . challenging , groundbreaking , powerful , beautiful and pleasant . rumor has that the title of the album was inspired in the molecular nanotechnology book `` engines of creation '' , written by k. eric drexler in 1986 . the book also have an interesting line that says that `` what we can do depends on what we can built '' . i do n't think that 's a mere coincidence , considering the illustrations on the album 's sleeves . judging by that we can presume that we have a conceptual record in hands . of course , as an experiemnt , somethings goes very nice and somethings nor in such a way . `` devil 's slide '' is a good example of a very cool , dynamic and inspired piece . `` borg sex '' is like imagining robots having sexual relations , and the song has a very nice mood . `` champagne ? '' is some kind of tribute to jeff beck , it 's very similar to the sound that jeff has been developing in his comeback album `` who else ! `` , by far , his best effort with techno rock . there 's also beautiful electronic moments like `` clouds race across the sky '' , witch is a nice soundscape song , and also human moments , like the wonderful ballad `` until we say goodbye '' and the awesome closing title track . but the breathtaking moment of the album is the two-track song `` the power cosmic 2000 '' , witch is a nice improvement compared with it 's version released as a single . with this release , joe got his foot into a modern and nice sound and continues to sound relevant . of course , this is the `` we do n't need another one '' kind of album . joe knew it very well , since techno music sounds dated nowadays , and returned to his human sound in his next release . but as far as it went , it was a wonderful experiment and a very consistent work that still deliver us in a nice mood
