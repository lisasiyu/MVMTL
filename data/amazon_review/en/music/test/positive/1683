great for the true fan this cd has some favorite tracks you 've heard before , and some tracks that only appeared on singles . the versions of songs from do or die are n't as good as the originals from do or die , but some of the new songs ( front seat , guns of brixton ) are great additions to any fan 's catalog . also , the live songs are pretty decent . pick this album up only if you have their other cds
