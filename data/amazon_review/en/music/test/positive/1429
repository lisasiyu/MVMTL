milestone for an exceptional but too-often overlooked artist chely wright is that rare artist whose voice conveys more than just melody , there 's raw emotion behind the words , and a range of emotion that runs the entire gamut from ecstasy to mournful sorrow . that she earned her first number one single with the title track from this album was both blessing and curse . `` single white female '' was pure country pop , upbeat and quirky , a unique initial offering on an album that grows progressively more complex and introspective with each subsequent song . that mca followed `` single white female '' by releasing the lyrically strong but folksy , down-tempo `` she went out for cigarettes '' is almost inexplicable ; the two songs are such polar-opposites that their back-to-back pairing on the album is somewhat jarring . there are so many solid songs on this album that it 's hard to say what could have happened had the follow-up been one of her more high-energy tracks or one of her more soul-searching ballads . thematically , single white female is an album about every facet of love , from the awkward beginning stages to the tearful end . the album 's true center comes not from the title track , but from the third single released , `` it was '' . for those attracted to the album by the title track , `` the fire '' comes closest to matching its energy and tone , followed by the radio-friendly `` some kind of somethin ' '' . together with `` single white female '' , this trio of peppy songs anchor and invigorate an overall somber ten-track album . perhaps the strongest track on the album is the fourth , `` unknown '' , a slow ballad with a wailing steel guitar accompaniment whose lyrics touch the great fears so many of us share of ending our days alone ; chely 's smoky voice has never conveyed more collective pathos . there 's also an updated version of her 1996 single , `` the love that we lost '' -- which , vocally , is so much stronger than the radio release from her second album that the two songs sound vastly different despite nearly identical musical arrangements . then there 's `` picket fences '' , a song laced with tangible irony , regret , and even denial -- a trifecta that paint a vivid but sad story of a career-driven persona . the album ends with the cute but bittersweet `` rubbin ' it in '' , a song about all those little haunting reminders that come after a relationship ends , and the desperate pining of `` why do i still want you '' . both lyrically and vocally , this is an album that strives to make a connection with the listener . for those so attuned , single white female is a too-often overlooked emotional journey that 's solid and rewarding , a milestone record in a career that deserves so much more attention from an artist who has never gotten the attention she truly deserves . closing in on a decade since the album 's release , the sound and the soul are still as fresh today as they were when single white female first hit store shelves , longevity that 's rare in an age of throw-away music from a seemingly endless parade of different but identical pre-fab singers
