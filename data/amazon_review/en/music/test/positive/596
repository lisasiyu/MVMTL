once again - do n't rent , buy ! in 2005 , chris columbus ( mrs. doubtfire , harry potter , home alone , etc . ) adapted jonathan larson 's beloved rock opera from stage to film and did a grand job in it . this soundtrack is a product of the music heard in the movie , and it as just as better as ever . with the usuals returning in 6 of the 8 main parts - rapp , pascal , menzel , diggs , martin , and heredia - there were still 2 parts left open as daphne rubin-vega ( mimi ) and fredi walker ( joanne ) declined . fortunatley , this soundtrack features two amazingly beautiful voices from their replacements who many consider are as good , and in my personal opinion are better , than the first two gals . tracie thoms plays joanne with dignity and a range that could knock someone over as she brings the house down with the famous high note in `` seasons of love . '' rosario dawson ( sin city , alexander ) has the best performance of her career as mimi , where she can sexily serenade any listener in `` out tonight '' and reduce some to tears in `` goodbye love . '' with most of the highlights sung in this film , some songs are better in this version ; while songs here are in its broadway 's parallel 's shadow . then there are some songs on here that do justice to their counterpart and they are both equally good . some improvments on this track are `` seasons of love , '' `` rent , '' `` without you , '' `` santa fe , '' `` tango maureen , '' and `` will i ? '' overall , just go get it . it 's amazing . your ears will thank you
