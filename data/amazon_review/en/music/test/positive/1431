smooth and smoking buddy guy is the definiition of the blues . this album is a collection of the chess recording years and is one of those albums i can put on and let run straight through . the first song on the album & quot ; worried mind & quot ; is a great lesson in & quot ; less is more & quot ; guitar soloing . & quot ; i found a true love is buttery smooth and & quot ; leave my little girl alone & quot ; is a blues classic . if your not convinced that this is a great album just remember that stevie ray vaughn and eric clapton considered buddy one of their biggest influences
