music for the morning after the day i forgot putting in pete 's own words ... it 's music for the morning after the day i forgot . i 'd say that sums it up . a great follow up . i perused a friend 's copy of `day i forgot ' on the way to pete 's house of blues show in cleveland in july . this is signature pete yorn . the disk is filled with obscure lyrics , wandering melodic twists , bizarre arrangements , unorthodox but brilliant production , and lots of guitar . i.e ... everything that should be expected in a pete yorn release . i was really glad i went to the show unfamiliar with this one . i really got turned onto some great new songs at the show . `all at once ' is the sleeping giant on this disc . an insightful and dark song about his father 's failure to relate to those around him ( i think ) . this album 's `closet ' has got to be `burrito ' ( coincidently also track 10 ) . if you like pete yorn , you 'll love this one . buy it . my copy 's on the way . i might also urge you avoid saving a buck on a used one and to get a new copy ( cast a vote ) . i do n't mind buying used garth brooks discs , but pete 's still trying to claw his way up . we do want to see a third album .
