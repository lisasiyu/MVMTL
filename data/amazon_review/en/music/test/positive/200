`` hits '' the spot `` hits '' is a collection of 16 songs from phil collins solo career , from 1981-1998 . i 'm a big fan of genesis ( both phil collins ' and peter gabriel 's ) , and phil 's `` groovy kind of love '' was playing on the way home on my first day of school , so i 'll always have a soft spot for this collection , and though it 's missing and has room for a couple of the hits i would have liked ( like `` do n't lose my number '' ) i have gone through a couple of copies of this one . phil really has a warmth and honesty to his love songs that 's pretty unique . his earthy voice , matched with the particular production he prefers , captures and evokes the 1980s pretty well too . that 's not to say he 's just 1980s ballads . he also sings of contemporary issues like in `` another day in paradise '' and `` both sides of the story '' , and does interesting descriptions of character in songs like `` in the air tonight '' and `` take me home '' . there 's a good mix of all that here . phil 's voice can get pretty powerful , on `` i wish it could rain down '' for intance . he 'd come a long way from quietly singing `` for absent friends '' ( one of his first recorded songs , featured on the 1971 genesis album `` nursery cryme '' ) . he 's a great drummer too , always had been , and even then he 's not afraid to play around with a drum machine , which were seen to some as a bit threatening in the 1980s , from what i 've read . the bonus track on `` hits '' is a version of cyndi lauper 's `` true colours '' , with some backing vocals by babyface . it 's pretty laid back , fits in with the hits , and i 'm glad to have it . the booklet folds out into a mini-poster with the vague impressions of his solo album covers ( as painted on this cd art ) on it . on the other side , there are credits for all the songs , which were interesting . i had no idea both sting and phil 's old friend peter gabriel do backup vocals of `` take me home '' , and i would n't have known unless i read it here . there 's a 2 cd phil collins compilation out there called `` love songs '' , and while there 's some good tracks , and some interesting bonus and live stuff on it , it 's all slower and sentimental , and does n't really show off phil 's versatility as well as `` hits '' . plus , with this compilation , there are songs from soundtracks and non-phil collins albums ( like `` buster '' , `` chinese wall '' , etc ) that you wo n't have to go hunting round for , as they 're all here in one place . genesis ' `` turn it on again : the hits '' would go well with this one , as it has phil 's other hits like `` invisble touch '' , `` i ca n't dance '' and `` follow you , follow me '' . recommended . four and a half stars
