extreme delight wow ! as a new admirer of michael 's , ( within the last 7 years or so ) i must admit that i 've been missing out on a lot . abandon garden just happens to be my favorite album of his , as well as one of my & quot ; all time 10 best albums & quot ; . i remember hearing some of his works when i was younger and thinking he was the voice behind & quot ; kermit the frog & quot ; . i had a chance to see him in concert once ( capital jazz fest , coulmbia , md july'98 ) and was absolutely enthralled . i have the complete collection of his works and i often play it for friends and co-workers . easily , abandoned garden is the favorite amongst them . even my non-jazz enthusiast friends seem to love the album . my favorite song is & quot ; a fools errand & quot ; . now have n't we all played that role before
