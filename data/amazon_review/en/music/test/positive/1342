a bit heavy on the band side of & quot ; pipes & amp ; drums & amp ; band & quot ; i bought this cd hoping to get the definitive recording of mass pipes and band playing amazing grace . i was not totally disappointed , but i already had a version that i think i like better which is on a cd entitled & quot ; the music of scotland : the scottish national pipe & amp ; drum corps and military band & quot ; . the sound quality is better and the transition from the first stanza of solo piper to massed pipes in the second stanza is smoother in terms of the introduction of the drones . the arrangement is basically the same except that it does n't have the extra flourish at the end of the third stanza before returning to the solo piper . the & quot ; national pipe and drum & quot ; cd also has more emphasis on pipes & amp ; drums and less on military band than does the & quot ; dragoon guards & quot ; cd . unfortunately i can not find the former cd listed on amazon . there is , however , nothing more stirring than & quot ; amazing grace & quot ; played with massed pipes -- no matter which one you get
