a few great songs ! and justice for all is one of metallicas best albums ... i dont really like the lyrics in blackened that much , i mean i like the song blackened . one of my favorite tracks is eye of the beholder ! ! title is great , but too long ! ! get this with 5 of their other albums like black , master of puppets , ride the lightning , reload , and load
