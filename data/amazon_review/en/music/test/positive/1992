20/20 ... the forgotten gem the only reason i gave this four stars is because it 's combined with friends , which with the exception of meant for you & the title song is just ok , in my opinion . 20/20 , however is loaded with phenomenal songs . do it again , i can hear music , be with me , time to get alone , our prayer ( a capella at it 's best ) , etc . for some reason , critics never even gave this album a chance and i do n't know why . maybe it did n't fit the late 60 's groove that was going on , but still the lyrics are strong and the harmonies are fantastic . yes , there is that one song , `` never learn not to love '' , whose lyrics were written by charles manson , but the way the song is done by the beach boys is just too good to pass off just because of who wrote it . this 2 cd set also includes break away and we 're together again , which are also excellent songs that never received any airplay . the only 2 songs that did were do it again and i can hear music . my advice is to buy this while you can . you wo n't be disappointed !
