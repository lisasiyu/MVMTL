bouncin ' tribute ! `` oh , my nola '' is a tribute to the crescent city by native harry connick jr . he grew up playing with jazz greats in the small clubs on burbon street , and this album feels like it came from there . every song sings and dances almost on its own , and jazz-lovers from long ago will remember hits like `` jambalaya ( on the bayou ) , '' `` careless love , '' `` wo n't you come home , bill bailey ? '' and `` lazy bones '' ( with spectacular trombone playing by lucien barbarin . ) my kids love this one , and we stop everything to sing together on `` the sheik of araby . '' the title song , a connick composition , says it all . this album is a tribute to the heritage of new orleans , and to the musical tradition that is kept alive by recordings like these . also check out `` chanson du vieux carre , '' a jazz recording released at the same time
