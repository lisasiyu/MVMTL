this cd is awesome ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i love scandal ! ! ! ! i have previously purchased the cd scandalous which at the time was the only way to find most of the material from their ep . that cd contains 4out of 5 songs . so it was a good collection . then i purchased patty smyth 's greatest hits featuring scandal because i was trying to get the rest of the group 's material . while it is also a great cd and contains alot of their material , it still left you wanted more . now we have it ! this cd is awesome . not only do you get all 5 songs from the ep but 4 never released tracks . i have to agree with the other reviewer , why did n't columbia just release all 9 songs and make a full lp ? , and yes it would have been wonderful if they would have just put the rest of the warrior material on this release and completed the scandal collection they are all great . this is a real treasure . i also own the warrior cd . now all i need to complete my collection of scandal/patty smyth is to purchase her 1987 self-titled solo album , which currently at amazon runs at about $ 25 . i guess that is n't bad considering what a rarity that album is . highly recommend this to anyone who is a scandal fan ! ! ! even if you own other scandal or patty smyth cds you will not have these 4 unreleased tracks . it is a must have ! !
