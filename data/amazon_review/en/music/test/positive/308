the good stuff by far , this is afi 's greatest release , period , if you do n't like it , go kiss raf . `` no dave party '' is an effing great instrumental track , if ya do n't know where it is , ya better start looking for it . every single song on this album is perfect , this is my favorite album of all time . this is the last album with the classic line-up and how fitting that it 's their best , no ? geoff went on to play in tiger army , he left them and is now in horrorpops . geoff 's bass playing is superb on this , the good stuff to say the least . mark 's guitar playing is pretty good , and adam 's drumming is the fast stuff . now , good old davey , the dxh . people will complain and say `` he sounds like he 's on elium '' and that `` his voice is too high '' . well , the man was 20 when he recorded this , what d'ya expect ? the lyrics are really good too , if you look closely , it 's got some pretty good straight edge stuff on it . then it 's got the typical outcast , teen fury stuff . if you 're a pissed off teenager and dig the real hardcore stuff-7 seconds , minor threat , black flag , etc.-not that fraudcore atreyu , from first to last crap you should get this . so yeah , best album ever , buy it . jx
