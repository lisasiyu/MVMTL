awesome ! jesus & amp ; mary chain have 2 sets of fans , those who like the feedback drenched & quot ; psychocandy & quot ; . and the rest of us , who like everything after . & quot ; automatic & quot ; is full of 50 's - 60 's guitar style rockers played in the jmc way . perhaps , one little flaw is the drum machine . but you ca n't deny the sheer power of & quot ; her way of praying & quot ; , & quot ; coast to coast & quot ; , & quot ; blues from a gun & quot ; and the classic & quot ; head on & quot ; . without all the feedback , the songs really come out ! they made it a point to stray away from & quot ; psychocandy & quot ; 's sound alltogether and sort of reinvented themselves , pissing off their early fans . ( like the reviewer before me ) . the band made that very clear with the title of their next great album & quot ; honey 's dead & quot ; in 1992 . get it
