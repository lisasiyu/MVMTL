is there a law that says you ca n't like both versions ? apparently , there 's an unwritten law that says you ca n't possibly like both versions of primal scream ? well , i beg to differ ! i happen to dig both the groundbreaking psychedelic/electronica sounds of the `` screamadelica '' and `` vanishing point '' discs as well as this far from innovative but still hugely enjoyable slice of retro-rock . fans of 70s-style hard rock with generous doses of funk , soul and blues will like this cd alot . when it comes to music , variety is the spice of life and diversity is more than welcome . expand your horizons ... just because it 's different from the rest of their catalog does n't automatically make it a failure .
