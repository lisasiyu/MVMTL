continued brilliance whenever anyone lists joe 's best albums , this one always appears at the top of any list . it really is amazing , with some of joe 's signature work , not the least of which is summer song , which has sort of become his anthem . this is a powerful song that rocks nonstop . the title track gets down in it , and the song friends carries such an optimistic feel to it . joe is the master at delivering a message without saying a single word . his guitar does the speaking for him , and it speaks beautifully . war and motorcycle driver are another couple of hard rockers . cryin ' is easy and more contemplative , and rubina 's blue sky happiness sounds like a courtship song , something to be played on a warm spring day with your sweetie . i 'm not sure what the name the extremist means , but if it involves joe 's mastery of the electric guitar , then the title sure fits him .
