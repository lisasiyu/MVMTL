great 1st album , too bad about him though ... the d.o.c . could have rivaled the greatest mcs alive like rakim , chuck d , and ice cube . but his vocal chords were tragically destroyed in a car accident after he released this cd . this cd is very good . it is one of the few albums you can listen to from track 1 to the end . of course these days it 's basically impossible to find one . the beats are great , and the lyrics are clever , although sometimes i feel they could have been better . his harsh sounding voice has a nice feel , and although he did release more albums after this one that were lyrically better than this , his ( lack of a ) voice kind of killed them . dre 's production is sick . overall this one 's a 4.5/5 . 1 . it 's funky enough -beat : 5 -lyrics : 4 -overall : 4.5 sick beat on a classic first track . 2 . mind blowin ' -beat : 4.5 -lyrics : 4 -overall : 4.5 3 . lend me an ear -beat : 5 -lyrics : 4.5 -overall : 4.5 a very hot fast rap by d.o.c . 4 . comm . blues a break 5 . let the bass go -beats : 5 -lyrics:4.5 -overall : 5 great song with a nice bass . 6 . beautiful but deadly -beats/guitar : 5 -lyrics : 5 -overall : 5 my second favorite joint on the cd . some great guitar solos . rapping on top of a guitar is a very nice touch . love it . 7 . the d.o.c . & the doctor -beats : 5 -lyrics : 5 -overall : 5 one of the ( many ) classics on the cd . 8 . no one can do it better -beats : 5 -lyrics : 5 -overall : 5 the title says it all ... 9 . whirlwind pyramid , 9.5/10 -beats : 5 -lyrics : 5 -overall : 5 great great great ... 10 . comm . 2 another break 11 . the formula -beats : 5 -lyrics : 5 -overall : 5 amazing song . 12 . portrait of a master piece -beats : 4.5 -lyrics : 4 -overall : 4 very good faster rapping by the doc . 13 . the grande finale -beats : 5 -lyrics : 5 -overall : 5 my favorite track . it features nwa , with raps by ice cube , ren , and eazy . i loved the nwa stuff more than the individual joints by all of them , so throwing the doc into it is like heaven for me . overall i say this album is a must have for anyone who 's into the birth of hardcore/gangsta rap from the golden age
