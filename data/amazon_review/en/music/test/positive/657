the greatest prince album the album `` sign `o ' the times '' by prince is one of my all-time favorites . not many people i encounter know anything about this cd and that is beyond shameful because they are missing out on one of the trippiest and most joyful musical experiences known to mankind . how 's that for hyperbole ? let 's break it down ... . 01 ) sign `o ' the times : this is a fantastic slow and spooky funk tune that waxes philosophical about such society ills as aids , gang violence , drugs , hurricanes , murders , poverty , war and even space shuttle explosions . much like john lennon 's song `` imagine '' , this tune is just as relevant in 2006 as it was when originally released . 02 ) play in the sunshine : this is one of my fave prince tunes ever . musically , it sounds like a psychedelic gospel rave up and lyrically , it is all about trippin ' on a natural high . fantastic track ! 03 ) housequake : prince brings the fun big time with this tune . a mixture of james brown , hip-hop and euro-dance-pop ; housequake is like nothing you 've ever heard ... and who else but prince in his prime would toss out a `` green eggs and ham '' reference in the middle of a mad-funky throw down ? 04 ) the ballad of dorothy parker : this is a mellow funk groove that plays like a collaboration between sly stone and joni mitchell . i kid you not ! 05 ) it : after four fantastic tunes in a row , you 'll be thinking `` man , this album is pure genius '' but then comes this song . the only bleak spot on an otherwise exceptional album . `` it '' is a meandering bit of danceable filler . prince released a single b-side from this same period called `` shockadelica '' that would have been much better in this position on the album . 06 ) starfish and coffee : this song begins with the sound of an alarm bell and proceeds to take us on a journey into the bizarre magic of childhood . another one of my faves for it 's sheer uniqueness . 07 ) slow love : this is a sensual jazzy love ballad that features some magnificent trumpet solos . 08 ) hot thing : what would a 1980 's prince album be without some blatant sexual innuendo ? well here it is furious and funky . the best part of this song is the saxophone work of eric leeds . 09 ) forever in my life : this is a slow romantic marriage proposal sung acapella with only the driving beat of a drum machine for accompaniment . yet another one-of-a-kind song . 10 ) u got the look : a funk-rock masterpiece with some latin percussion driving the mix . this song is the `` lucy in the sky with diamonds '' of dance music . 11 ) if i was your girlfriend : on this song , prince writes in a conversational style as if telling his girlfriend that he wants a closeness with her that she usually reserves for her best girlfriend . one of the most interesting and daring lyrics you 're likely to ever come across . 12 ) strange relationship : another out-of-the-ordinary lyric about a couple with a love / hate relationship that neither one can put an end to . features the great chorus ... '' baby , i just ca n't stand to see you happy / more than that , i hate to see you sad / honey if you left me i just might do something rash / what 's this strange relationship ? '' 13 ) i could never take the place of your man : this is guitar pop at it 's best with a great lyric about actually turning down a woman 's sexual advances . features a terrific guitar solo / break down midway through the song . 14 ) the cross : this is a song about overcoming the adversity in life through spiritual faith in but even if you 're an atheist , you wo n't be able to deny the rhythmic and melodic power of this tune . it starts off slow , quiet and acoustic then builds to an all out rockin ' climax . 15 ) it 's gon na be a beautiful night : this is a 9 minute jam-out track that was recorded live with prince 's unbelievable 80 's band the revolution ... featuring shelia e. on the drums . a truly remarkable funk experience that showcases shelia e. rapping edward lear 's classic poem `` the table and the chair '' in the middle of all the musical mayhem . another one of my faver most faves ! 16 ) adore : this amazing album comes to a end with this gorgeous classic-style r & b ballad . what a trip ! if you 've never heard this album , i strongly suggest that you check it out immediately and give your ears a sonic treat . just skip song number 5
