absolutely lovely songs although i am an admirer of the fact that maria mckee has the ability to consistently shift genres ( seemingly ) effortlessly from album to album , i was very pleased to discover that this album has more than a little common - in feeling - with my favorite of her recordings , life is sweet . alas , the bowie flavored guitar is gone but the tone set by the quieter tracks on that 96 album is very much accounted for . `` my one true love '' , `` people in the way '' , and `` everyone 's got a story '' are my favorites among the acoustic based gems on this strongly song oriented work . i love the fact that all of these songs have such memorable hooks , but some do n't reveal themselves until a second or third listen . and do n't let the title fool you , but `` sullen soul '' is the most soaringly majestic track on the record , one that just begs to be heard from a car radio on a cool summer night . so if you 're on this page already take the plunge and buy the album . i know you 're curious
