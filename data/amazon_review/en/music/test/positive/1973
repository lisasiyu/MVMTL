out of this world this album would have the 5 stars it deserves if it were n't for mr. feng nit-picking about technical stuff . if you do n't want all the extra versions of tunji you can go out to any music store and get the original version for $ 12 . `` out of this world '' is the most profoundly beautiful musical statement i have ever heard , from any artist , in any genre . that track alone makes it worth the price of admission .
