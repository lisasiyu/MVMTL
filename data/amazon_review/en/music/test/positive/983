this is why melodic death is good whatever happened to the good old days where swedish music truly ruled . now , melodic death seems to be dying out in that country , with classic bands such as soilwork , in flames , and arch enemy all having changed their sounds completely . i 'm talking about the good old experimental days where everything might 've seemed risky but the price of success even greater . albums like `` slaughter of the soul '' are true masterpieces . they only come once for a band . every known melodic death band has that classic album , and for at the gates , although they are no dead , this is it . and to tell you the truth , this is actually where melodic death started , which is in no means bad . it is fresh and brutal , probably what many people resort to rather than the melodic side of the music that bands tend to release now
