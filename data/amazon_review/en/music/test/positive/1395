more than solid sophomore album one of the most ecxiting new bands to come out of cincinnati in recent years is the heartless [ ... ] ( urrgh , what a terrible band name ) , a power trio led by singer-songwriter-guitarist erila wennerstrom . 18 months after the release of their very promising debut album `` stairs and elevators '' now comes the second album . `` all this time '' ( 10 tracks , 40 min . ) finds a more polished , but still very hard rocking , sound . the album 's first track `` into the open '' starts off with a piano even . wennerstrom continues to provide layers of guitar riffs , and the rest of the band contributes to the `` wall of sound '' . guitar solos are far and few between ( only on the title track and on the closer `` comes a long way '' ) . the album really takes flight on the second half , with highlight after highlight : `` blue day '' and `` no pointing arrows '' are the proof that this band has `` it '' . in all , a very satisfying album that zooms by in no time , and you 'll want to play it again . i 've seen the band live a couple of times in the last 10 days , giving shows around town in preparation for a long nation-wide tour to support `` all this time '' . frankly , the band is even better live than in the studio , and they are not to be missed if you have chance to see them . highly recommended
