a supergroup that did n't need any hype at all jd souther , chris hillman and richie furay had a history in the musicbusiness before they joined the shf-band and it did n't do any harm i have to tell you . the album was hyped at the time , maybe the reason the group did n't reach to its full potential . the album still hit # 11 in the bb album charts in 1974 with furays '' fallin ' in love ' being their only hitsingle . there 's more here than just that one 'heavenly fire ' 'deep , dark and dreamless ' being beautiful richly harmony filled country ballads 'border town ' and 'safe at home ' hard rocking popsongs which might as well have been recorded by poco or the eagles . maybe that was the main problem : although all 10 songs where written by groupmembers , the sound was not unique . never the less this group deserves recognition for providing at an excellent collection of 10 beautiful songs on one album . a huge accomplishment in a period in which fans of the more succesful groups had to do with one or two gems on one lp . they could saved their money and just bought this one
