their finest hour most people think that the heavily overrated black album is metallicas best cd . i completely disagree . this would be their best cd . although this band was never as good as megadeth or slayer , this cd is still an epic in metal . this cd is their most technical release . the guitars are very complex , and while they can not compete with the brutality of slayer or the technicality of megadeth , they are still complex , with lots of crushing riffs and wailing solos , as well as many melodic parts . you ca n't hear the bass very well , but the guitars more than make up for it . the drums are great . too bad metallica would follow up their best cd with their sellout album , then sink into the mainstream . this cd is awesome enough , but rust in peace is even better
