must have ! this amazingly beautiful album to me is the soundtrack of anatolia , of an era gone by when turks , greeks , armenians and other ethnic groups shared their lives peacefully and harmoniously . its sadness inevitably reminds me of millions who unnecessarily died on this soil in many wars fought in early twentieth century , of people forced to leave the only land the knew for unknown destinations and destinies , of the unimaginable hardships endured by its people . and more personally it takes me fom new york and puts me right next to my father 's grave in a forgotten anatolian village , 6000 miles away
