perfect in every way eazy-e is my favorite rapper and i find him highly underrated . he was easily the best member in nwa and the hype surrounding his death should have been much bigger . he is a one-of-a kind rap genius with a sound unlike anybody else . this album is a masterpiece and is perfect in every way . the opening song still talkin ' is hilarious and eazy drops freestyles that sound like he isnt even trying . to hear some of his best verses of all time check out no more ? s which is my absolute favorite song done by him ever . the album flows together beautifully and even the bonus songs at the end are funny including merry muthaf***in ' xmas which is classic . other classics include ruthless villian , 2 hard mutha 's , boyz-n-the hood remix , eazy-duz-it and we want eazy . there is no doubt in my mind that he should be a legend along with pac and biggie ... he just left way before he could establish himself as big as them . also the feud with dre and death row hurt his reputation greatly right before he died . nonetheless he is amazing and dre & mc ren also add to this great cd . do not hold out.. buy this asap
