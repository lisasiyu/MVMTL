a little more about the sound not being an `` audiophilic '' sophisticate i can hardly delve into details of this recording 's sound reproduction , but it is not nearly as bad as to make this great performance un-listenable . quite the opposite , the peculiarities of the sound have deeper reasons behind them . bach wrote wtk for the keyboard , but in his mind he must have heard them played on a particular instrument . if gould ( whose wtk , imho , is his weakest bach recording ) plays it like a harpsichord , or schiff ( another dud ) - like fortepiano , every note of richter 's performance echoes with the sound of an organ . i am certain it was deliberate on richter 's part , and the fact that the selected venue of the recording was a church , only confirms that notion . of course , the church 's acoustics did affect the sound , but in a way that was consistent with the artist 's conception . as far as the playing itself , there is not much i can add to what has been written by the previous reviewers . book ii , which is somewhat more `` abstract '' portion of the wtk-48 , receives great treatment here , but it is richter 's performance of book i that stands like a solitary granite peak , high above the clouds , projecting mysterious and purifying force .
