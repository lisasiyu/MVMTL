my intro to the elements of the universe ! though i know they made 3 albums before this one with an early line up of some of the best jazz players of the time and future jazz players even ( hubert & ronnie laws ) ... 1973 's `` head to the sky '' was my first introduction to the elements of the universe aka earth , wind & fire ! they are my all-time favorite band and this is the album that started that love affair between them and myself ! in 1973 , i was a 9 yr old kid who was developing my own burgeoning musical gifts , and boy , was there so many great musical mentors from that time to follow ... stevie was in the middle of his incredible creative run with `` innervisions '' taking the world by storm ! donny hathaway was at his brilliant peak with the now iconic `` extensions of a man '' .. ( i miss donny ! ) war was groovin ' with `` deliver the word '' , sly stone was bumpin ' the airwaves with his last good effort `` fresh '' , a pre-mothership funkadelic was ripping it up and slightly freaking my little 9 yr old brain out with their 1973 effort `` cosmic slop '' , the isley brothers had revamped and were begining their incredible 70 's multi-platinum streak with `` 3+3 '' ... . man , it was truly a time of artistic giants and the bar was set high then ! ( unlike today ! ) of course i was exposed to all this and more by my mother and older cousins who were doing their thing at that time with the weed , wine and parties ! but even then , my musical aesthetic was way keen and i was absorbing everything i heard at warp speed ! one day my momz brought home an album with this group of smiling faces on it , adorned in the flower / peace regalia of the time and it read `` head to the sky '' .. i listened intently as she put it on and the tribal thunderstorm that is the intro to `` evil '' swept me up ! that was the first time i 'd ever heard the instrument that was to become an e , w & f staple in years to come.. the kalimba , and man could maurice wail on that thing ! i loved the atmosphericness of this album ! all music was like that then , it created it 's own atmosphere and took you to a heightened place . after the tribal funk of `` evil '' , my young ears were treated to what sounded like angels ascending from heaven as the sitar/fender rhodes intro of `` keep your head to the sky '' began with verdine purculating underneath on bass and al mackay and johnny graham doing their thing subtlely . then a 21 yr old phillip bailey , one of the greatest falsetto voices ever , at the height of his gifts , began to sing and i was transfixed ! when that angelic sounding chorus kicked in , i felt like i had left my body ! and just when i thought i could n't go any higher.. philip and jessica cleaves , who would leave the group soon after this album was released , chimed together like songbirds from nirvana ! that did it ! ... i was disciple from then on ! `` build your nest '' was as funky as an old batch of cabbage ! it had a good message and a young larry dunn was wearing that clavinet out big time ! then a piercing sonic interlude led to the gospel-inflected and deeply introspective song `` the world 's a masquerade '' , one of my faves to this day ! maurice was holding church ! ..laying down his story of how humanity is hypocritical & phony at times , and phillip and the choir was testifying in the background ! it was pure rapture to my ears then and still gives me chills now , some 33 yrs later ! side two opened with the breezy jazzy-funk of `` clover '' , which was great too , followed by the latin-jazz fusion of `` zanzibar '' which is like an iliad through afro-carribean music utopia ! to say that this album and group left an indelible impression on my pysche is an understatement ! of course , after this one was a string of majestic and innovative material which grooved the world and made them the icons that they are ! but this album was my introduction to them , and like any first love , it lingers in your memory forever ! -- enjoy --
