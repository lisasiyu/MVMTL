a flawless cd patty loveless 's work in the 80s and 90s was exceptional ( it is a shame that she shifted to bluegrass ( maybe because she ca n't get any airplay on country stations ? which favors stuff like faith hill , who ca n't even carry patty 's microphone . ) .as for this cd , it is exceptional , you can not get much better on a single disk than this ( maybe toby keith 's greatest hits 2 ? ) . songs like `` i think about elvis '' , `` lonely too long '' , `` blame it on your heart '' . `` here i am '' , and `` how can i help you say goodbye ? '' ( a real heartwrenching song , and this is from an alpha male ) , are country classics . and the rest of the cd does not have a weak song either . patty loveless blows away just about any other female country singer since patsy cline with the exception of sherrie austin ( another singer who can not get airplay ) . there is beauty , humor , sadness , and most of all intelligence in her music . patty is country for people who love intelligent , well thought out , and original lyrics . i would highly recommend getting this cd , then go out an get her `` greatest hits '' cd for material such as `` timber '' and `` chains '' ( that cd also gets 5 stars , but is a little weaker ) . simply put this is a flawless cd
