classic soundtrack this soundtrack is a mix . my favorite songs are some of the prototype 80 's tracks : danger zone , mighty wings , & through the fire . but it also has some great oldies like dock of the bay & great balls of fire . if you have n't seen this movie yet then go out and rent it . then pick up a copy of the soundtrack
