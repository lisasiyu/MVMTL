chaotic metal : definitely an acquired taste i got a good laugh out of the sticker on the corner of `` everything is alive ... '' that read something like `` for fans of opeth , unearth , and ashlee simpson '' . a band on solid state records that sounds like a mediocre pop `` star '' ? yeah right ; this band definitely has sense of humor . when i first played the cd , i listened to the first track all the way through . i absolutely hated it . i then skipped through all the other tracks and listened to about 30 seconds of each . more of the same . i could n't believe that i had wasted my money on this pile of slow-paced loud noisy garbage . the guitar feedback grated on my eardrums , and i ended up with a massive headache . needless to say , i took a break from the chariot for a while . a few weeks later , however , the song `` die interviwer '' popped up on my mp3 player 's random shuffle , so i listened to the whole song . i could actually tolerate it . soon , i started listening to more and more songs from the album , and i was amazed by the realness of the sound , and the incredible brutality of it all : the ripping guitars , the pounding drums , and the lead singer , who roars like a man possessed . i listened to the album all the way through , and i was hooked . the chariot is a truly incredible band , and is nothing like i 've ever heard before . they draw a listener in more than norma jean ever will . they are just as amazingly brutal in concert , also . however , a word of warning : you can not just start listening to this band . a love of metal is required , and you have to be open to new styles . i would recommend listening to bands such as becoming the archetype before picking this album up . but it is well worth it ; listening to the chariot is a breathtaking experience
