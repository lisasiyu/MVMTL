a revelation ! i thought i was taking a bit of chance buying this cd , as i was only familiar with the classics `` for your love '' and `` heart full of soul '' , but i was on a british invasion kick . wow ! this cd like , blew me away , man . for only one surprise , i was delighted to discover `` shapes of things '' - a great tune i certainly remembered , but never knew its name or its yb origin . the only other piece i sort of recall was `` the train kept a-rollin '' which was featured in re-worked form in the antonioni film `` blow up '' . this , and the rest that was completely new to me , i just love : `` evil hearted you '' and `` mr. you 're a better man than i '' are two others i find buzzing through my head throughout the day . even if i 'm a tad less patient with live stuff , which can veer into show-offy , formless indulgence , these guys can pull it off , as i find myself digging that fuzz-guitar/feedback rave-up ( plus they know enough not to go on forever ) . i 'll most definitely look into this band further - their music and their story . enthusiastically recommended to anyone with any curiousity about this band
