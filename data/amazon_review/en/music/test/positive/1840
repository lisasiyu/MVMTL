voted the greatest instrumental album of all-time ! i will be doing a review on the legendary masterpiece cd album entitled `` are you experienced ? '' by the late great guitar legend , the one and only jimi hendrix . this cd album was originally released on vinyl in 1967 on jimi 's old reprise records label affiliated with warner brothers and once owned by the late great frank sinatra . i own three ( 3 ) different versions of this album on cd and the matrix or id numbers are as follows : 825 416-2 , 6261-2 and mcad-10893 . two of the three cd 's i own are definitely collector 's items which i will never sell . if i hear or read any new information concerning this legendary album , i will edit this review so that you the consumer will get the best and most accurate review possible . in my opinion , this album has to rank in the top 10 as one of the greatest albums ever recorded . mojo magazine recently held a poll as to what album is the greatest instrumental album of all time . guess what , jimi hendrix 's `` are you experienced ? '' from 1967 won the poll as the greatest instrumental album of all-time ! this album truly deserves it ! all the songs listed in this album are g-r-e-a-t ! i also noticed that on all three versions i own of this album contain different song tracks or omitted main songs such as `` purple haze , '' `` the wind cries mary '' and `` foxey lady . '' these rockers and ballad along with `` manic depression , '' `` fire , '' `` can you see me , '' `` i do n't live today '' and the main centerpiece of the album entitled `` are you experienced ? '' are all great songs that compliment this album . in my opinion , my favorite songs on this album are `` may this be love '' and `` remember . '' these two songs are so beautifully crafted and so well written by hendrix that his emotions flow through his guitar and music resulting in some of the greatest masterpieces on this album and in rock n ' roll history . `` may this be love '' sounds so beautiful , romantic and poetic that you can not help but be absorbed and feel hypnotized by this slow mellow song but powerful ! i can talk about all of these songs but it will extend this review into a long review like my previous hendrix reviews in the past . i highly reccommend this album and is a must and necessity for everyone to own in their music collection . in closing , jimi hendrix is the first true guitar god that has left his mark in rock n ' roll history and will never be forgotten . his accomplishments in rock n ' roll as well as the blues are revolutionary and legendary , there is only one jimi hendrix that comes along in a lifetime . there will never be another jimi hendrix . what a tragic loss for rock n ' roll . i hope you enjoyed reading my review as much as i enjoyed writing it for all of you . i also hope that you will read all of my other reviews in the near future when time permits . jimi lives ! long live rock n ' roll ! rock out always and take care . j.l .
