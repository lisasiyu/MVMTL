one of their most underrated efforts time and a word ( 1970 . ) the second yes album . introduction : yes first came onto the musical scene in 1969 , with the release of their self-titled debut album . the collaboration between singer jon anderson and bass player chris squire showed serious potential with the release of that first album . sadly though , it was overlooked by the music-loving public of the day . the band would make it big , but that would take a few more years . the band 's 1970 sophomore album , time and a word , was equally overlooked , sadly enough . so , just how does the second album from the classic progressive rockers fare ? keep reading , and you shall see . overview : -time and a word was released november of 1970 . -the album was produced by tony colton . -the album 's tracklist consists of no opportunity necessary no experience needed , then , everydays , sweet dreams , the prophet , clear days , astral traveller , and time and a word . -the band on this album consisted of vocalist jon anderson , drummer bill bruford , bassist chris squire , keyboardist tony kaye , and guitarist peter banks . the band here was unchanged from the debut album . this was peter banks ' last album with yes ; he 'd be replaced by steve howe for the band 's next album . review : the two albums yes did before steve howe joined the band are , without question , the most underrated works they ever did . it 's a shame these albums get so overlooked , because they are nothing short of excellent . all eight tracks this album serves up are among the band 's finest , and certainly among their most unique . i was n't sure what to think of this album due to its somewhat mixed reputation , but one listen to it showed me that this was one of the finest progressive rock albums of its time . the songs on here sound nothing like anything the band had done prior or sense , meaning this is arguably the band 's most unique-sounding album . these tunes are tough to describe and to put into words , but i 'll do my best . the band kicks things off with one of my all-time favorite songs they ever did - no opportunity necessary , no experience needed . the songs combines classical-style orchestration with the classic organ-heavy prog rock this version of yes is noted for . a solid opener , indeed . and then we move on to the second track on the album , then . the underrated bill bruford is the star of the show here - his rapid drumming in the verses simply must be heard to be appreciated . and tony kaye 's keyboarding is excellent , too ( it 's a shame he gets overlooked in favor of the more popular rick wakeman most of the time . ) next up is everydays , a cover of a buffalo springfield tune . like most of the band 's covers , the song itself stays true to the original , but it gets a total revamp with plenty of organ playing and extended instrumental portions . and believe it or not , i just might like this version of the song more than the original ! and then we have sweet dreams . i 've always like this tune , because it 's somewhat of the happy medium between the band 's early pre-howe material and the more popular stuff that would come later . another underrated yes tune . track five is the prophet , one of the best songs on the album . the first half is instrumental , and peter banks and tony kaye beautifully demonstrate their musical abilities on their respective instruments ( it 's a shame these guys got so overlooked in favor of their successors . ) once again , the song implements elements of a classical-style , orchestral piece , and as a whole this makes the song better . following that tune , we get to clear days , the sixth song on the album . this is a slow and melodic piece with a low-pitched violin backing anderson 's vocals . it 's probably the most baroque-sounding thing yes ever did . it 's a shame they did n't make this song longer and a little more developed , because it could have been a masterpiece . still , it 's very good the way it is . seventh on this album is astral traveler . the song 's sound is absolutely brilliant , featuring a sort of `` space rock '' sound that sounds like the band 's later material , but at the same time it sounds totally different . hard to describe this song , but it 's a good one ! closing things out is the title track . this is a slow , melodic track with excellent backing instrumentation . it definitely brings the late beatles sound to mind . overall , this track makes for a damn good finisher . and in the end , time and a word stands as one of the band 's underrated masterpieces . edition notes : in the early twenty-first century , the yes catalogue got a much-needed reissuing . the new versions of the albums feature remastered sound , expanded liner notes , and bonus tracks . these new versions of the albums on cd kill older cd issues dead . if you do n't have the albums yet , be sure you get the remastered ones ! overall : in the end , yes proves that they had the ability to make excellent music from the very beginning . who cares if it does n't sound like the band that most people know and love ? the music itself flat-out rules . it also goes to establish just how talented the underrated tony kaye and peter banks are - it 's a shame their successors in yes get all the credit from most fans . oh , well . final verdict ? if you 're new to yes , you might want to start with the yes album or fragile . this is a great album , no questions asked , although there are better starting points . that said , though , this is a solid album through and through , and it belongs in the collection of every yes fan .
