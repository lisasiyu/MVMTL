if not for us eccentric music fans it would be totally forgotten what a shame . such a good debut album yet no one even knows who they are . jay ferguson is one of the luckiest or most talented artists . he achieved success in 3 forms ( spirit , jo jo and thunder island solo ) . this is a great , gritty , greasy , soulful southern rock album . i would like to see a modern band do a cover so as to resurrect this quality band . how about metalica doing run , run run ?
