chris 's second best i 've attempted to give five stars to 'shamrock diaries ' so i ca n't really give the same to 'on the beach ' despite it being stylistically similar to its predecessor , and nearly as good . really , a very , very good album with only a few clunkers . great melodies , great atmosphere
