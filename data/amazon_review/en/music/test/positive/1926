hidden gem background : his first five warner bros. records with the original group are 5 stars to me . then came `` welcome to my nightmare '' ( another 5 star in my opinion ) . `` goes to hell '' slips to four stars , `` lace and whiskey '' slips to two stars , and then he just falls off the radar screen . `` from the inside '' is more of a vince furnier record , `` flush the fashion '' opens strong with a cover of `` talk , talk '' and then `` clones '' before the album falls to pieces . `` special forces '' seems totally phony . then , out of nowhere with the worst ( or best ) album cover i 've ever seen , he delivers `` zipper catches skin . '' this album features the familiar guitar sound of dick wagner . the music sounds like vintage alice ( with an 80s edge ) . but , there 's something else here . his vocals have confidence again ! ! his lyrics are silly , but clever again . the guitar has bite ... the album has genuine attitude . that 's hard to fake . that 's the old alice ! sadly , this album is the last of the classic alice cooper magic . sure , i witnessed his comeback ( s ) . `` trash '' had a moment or two , but not the classic cooper sound . not everything on zipper works , but most of it rocks .
