lovely lila ! ! ! lila downs is by far the most amazing vocalist of our time . i have all her cd 's and ca n't wait until the next . her music and live shows are inspiring and moving . she 's a latina who keeps it real and is proud of who she is , where she comes from and where she 's been . i had the honor of meeting her and her inner beauty surely compliments her outer beauty . her talent is moving , and her humility inspiring . i recommend this cd 100 % as well as all her others . hear it for yourself ... and catch her live performances when she 's in your town
