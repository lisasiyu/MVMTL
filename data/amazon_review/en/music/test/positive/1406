ub40 at their best i first bought this album in the early 80s and i played it to death . i 've been very dissappointed with later ub40 albums . to my mind this album is how ub40 should sound . i still experience a thrill every time i hear the beginning to `` present arms '' . `` sardonicus '' just cooks , great intro and just it bubbles alongs . at a matter of fact , all the songs ( with the exception of love is all is alright & do n't slow down , which is are bit limp ) on this album are very good . if you like trippy sounding ska with a slight dub flavour , i 'm confident that you will like this album
