get down with da goblin profondo rosso is probably goblin 's finest hour in the soundtrack department , though i think many would debate that suspiria and zombi might be a little better . i wo n't go into the music , coz i ca n't imagine someone buying this cd who 's unfamiliar with the film and the music from the film . you do get your money 's worth , this sucker is 72 minutes long . my only complaint with this , and all the other goblin soundtracks is that there are about eight billion different versions of the same song . i know people like this , but to me it gets a little irritating . the alternate versions are n't really all that different from one another ( with a few exceptions ) -at least not different enough to want to hear the song again when you just heard it one or two tracks ago . i mean , do we really need that many versions of the lullaby song ? but on the other hand , i do respect the fact that cinevox went out of their way to make this as complete as possible . and considering you have to take out a loan to pay for these soundtracks , it does n't seem so bad in the end . what it really comes down to is-if you like the music when you watch the film , then you 'll like this cd
