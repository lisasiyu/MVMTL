another remarkable album ignore the previous reviewer because it is full of clarical errors . first off , houdini was released in 1993 , not 1995 . i do n't understand this rambling about the melvins going downhill in 1995 starting with houdini . kurt cobain was the one who helped the melvins get on a major label ( atlantic ) and it lasted for three albums before they were decided as being too nontradtional and not mainstream accessible . houdini , stoner witch and stag comprise this era , and all are fine albums worth owning with perhaps stag being the most unconventional of the three . i do n't get how anyone could be critical of the melvins , because as a whole , they have an impressive body of work that is always expanding and does n't get pigeon holed in any preconceived notions of genre or labels . also to dismiss `` what ever they have done in the last ten years '' without even bothering to listen to it is just plain ignorant . to recap : all melvins albums are worth owning if you give them a chance the post 1995 work includes honky ( 1997 ) the magggot ( 1999 ) the bootlicker ( 1999 ) the crybaby ( 2000 ) electroretard ( 2001 ) the collusus of destiny ( 2001 ) hostile ambient takeover ( 2002 ) the pigs of the roman empire ( 2004 ) and yes even the most recent album with jello biafra is worth picking up . enjoy
