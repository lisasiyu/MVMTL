awesome soundtrack ! the national treasure soundtrack is one of my favorites . it 's up-beat , and fast-paced , and very energetic . it has an interesting mix of orchestral , techno , and rock music - put together in a very creative way . it does n't have many of those moments of miscillaneous chords wandering around everywhere like alot of soundtracks i 've heard do . the only thing is that there are only a few themes and they are repeated a lot . so , listening to it to much may get you tired of those themes pretty quickly . other than that , i 've really enjoyed listening to it - and i highly reccommend it
