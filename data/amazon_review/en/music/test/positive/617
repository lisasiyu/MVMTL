a dark ride rosanne cash 's meditation of the loss of life and love ( her father , johnny ; her stepmother , june carter cash ; and her mother , vivian cash distin ) is her darkest album since the divorce chronicle of `` interiors . '' she calls into question both god and herself on such songs as `` house on the lake '' and the title track . like some of emmylou harris ' best work ( like the recent `` red dirt girl '' ) , rosanne has moved to the far fringe of country and given her music an both a dose of intelligence atmospheric edge . you wo n't find any lighthearted 'redneck girl ' stompers here . in fact , `` radio operator '' is probably the closest thing to a generic country song on `` black cadillac . '' this is a good thing . cash refuses to bend to anyone 's rules ( much like she has on some of her other great records and `` rules of travel ) . she delivers both her grief and her resolve simply and elegantly on `` dreams are not my home '' and gives a reality check face slap to bickering lawyers on `` like fugitives '' and a reaffirmation of life/faith on `` god is in the roses . '' to say that `` black cadillac '' is merely a tribute to her lost family members is selling the cd short . rosanne is , like the dixie chicks , slaid cleaves , emmylou harris or even her father 's `` american music '' series , making country music for thoughtful adults
