they do n't come like this anymore sometimes you just want to be transported to a different musical universe , to a time when everything was possible.from the outrageous clothes of alphonse on the cover ( why are we so boring these days ? ) to the fantastic tight energetic playing of everyone involved , this is a cd that holds up remarkably well.the sound quality on my cd is amazing , and if you think jazz fusion means unstructured noodling then you could n't be further from the truth with this disc.the songs are focused and precise with accessible melodies and inspired solos.there is a real sort of joy that emanates from this music thats very refreshing in our crazy 21st century world
