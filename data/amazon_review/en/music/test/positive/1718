best rancid album of all time ! to me , this is rancid 's best work . i do n't understand why people say it 's `` rough around the edges '' , and crap like that ! this is punk people ! anyways , every song is fast , and catchy - which to me makes it a classic . this album kicks off with `` adina '' , ( one of the best songs on this cd ) which is a fast short song , with awesome guitar riffs . and after you hear that song ... you definetely will wan na listen to the next - trust me . and the next song `` hyena '' , is another one of the best songs , and an awesome chorus that 's all yelling ... every song has it 's own thing that makes it good . one of the slower songs , has got to be `` outta my mind '' . tim 's singing is what makes this song a classic ( to me ) . tim 's guitar work , bret 's drumming , and matt 's bass playing are at their best on this album . so if you 're new to rancid , i would highly recommend this . if not this , `` let 's go '' is another good one .
