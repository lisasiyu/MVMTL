leave the light on i could n't think of a better title for my review , listen to the the song and i think you will agree . chris smither gets better with every cd that he makes . he has a sound of his own and sees and hears life through a very unique perspective . there is not a cut on this cd that i do n't like . try it you want be disapointed
