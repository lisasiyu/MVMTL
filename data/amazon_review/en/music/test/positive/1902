listen to the dramatics at their best ! i recently purchased this cd , what can i tell you it was like tasteing vintage champagne . i wanted more , the only negative was they left out my favorite dramatics song life of the party . otherwise a great cd just shopping not buying , if your not a fan this song will seal the deal . the intro alone is worth the price of the cd and ron bank 's falsetto ( unbelieve able ) . my recommendation buy it now
