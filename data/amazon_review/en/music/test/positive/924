my favorite boxset first off , to all the people who wrote in and said the dvd is not good what did you expect ? the holy grail in the form of a dvd ? this is one of the best performances i 've seen & heard . granted jonas does not look terribly happy to be there , but he sounded great . while i , too , got all the studio albums the day they came out i had to get this collection ( mainly for the dvd ... which does not dissapoint ) but also for the unreleased songs ... nothing about this set let me down ( although i would like to have seen an interview or video on the dvd ) . for any fan of katatonia-do n't miss out . a lot of it is redundant , but the rest is fantastic
