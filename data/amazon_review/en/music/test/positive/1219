a change of direction for the great jt like most of jt 's work , this album contains easy listening soft rock . it marked a change of direction for jt in that it lacks the introspective , personal quality of his earlier albums . still , it contains some very good music , backed up by some of the greatest musicians around , including graham nash , david crosby , carly simon , randy newman , and saxophone master david sanbourn . like always , it has jt 's beautifully sweet voice and laid back six string accoustic guitar . several classic hits came out of the album including the `` mexico '' and `` how sweet it is to be loved by you . '' like much of jts work , it reminds me of the easy comfort of waking up to diffuse sunlight on a sunday morning
