only the lord knows probably only the lord knows why i love this album so much . like another reviewer , my wife and son wo n't let me play it while their around , so i play and sing along with it while i am alone in the car . yes , leon 's voice is terrible to some , a little whiney to some but that is what gives the album its charm . you can hardly sing worse ! the song selections are classic . the band is great . i love the steel guitars of pete drake , curly chalker , weldon myrick , and hal rugg . then you have the classic dobro of tut taylor on uncle pen ! what more is there to love
