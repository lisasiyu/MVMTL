typically bacharach ... ... loved this record all my life . i 'm in my mid-30 's now but fondly remember this from the early seventies , when my mum used to play it at my grandparents house . it evokes some very warm memories ... vaguely remember watching the film on tv too but it must have been a very long time ago . bacharach 's trademark orchestration runs throughout the album , the sudden burst of trumpet on the opening track followed by a crescendo as the strings come in made me fill up with tears ... i had n't heard this album since i was about ten and it seemed as fresh as yesterday ! the instrumental break in 'share the joy ' as the strings rise to a real high point never fail to make the hairs stand up on my arms , what a lovely lovely piece of music . the vocal performances too ... flawed as they are , are perfect for the songs ... they seem more natural and 'human ' than some perfect operatic performance . sally kellerman 's vocal is a great example of this . i 'd always assumed that peter finch , liv ullmann , olivia hussey et al had actually performed the songs but now thanks to the superb sleeve notes i now know better ... it shattered my illusions a little but hey ... it still sounds as if it 's a stage actor trying his best to sing on 'it might frighten her away ' and i love it ! ! ! i was slightly worried that listening to this soundtrack again after so long might be a let down ... i need n't have worried ... a superb bit of 'bacharach & david ' for old romantics everywhere . here 's to us all finding our own shangri-la out there somewhere .
