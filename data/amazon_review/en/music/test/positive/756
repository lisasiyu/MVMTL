powerful and passionate ... . a lot of people really freaked out when dylan became a born again christian . i remember reading that he appeared on saturday night live in 1979 right around the time this album got released , and that the cast and staff were terrified of his christianity . i find their paranoia silly . much of dylan 's work dealt with god and religious & spiritual issues anyway , here it was just made more explicit . this is one of dylan 's best albums . his voice is filled with passion , and these songs are excellent . all of these songs still hold true today . slow train , got ta serve somebody , precious angel , and when you gon na wake up ? are my favorites here . there is n't one wasted song on the whole album . even if you 're not religious , you can listen to this . this is a great spiritual record . it is n't overly preachy , and it is n't sanctimonious . it 's just really sincere , like all great art . dylan rules ...
