a spanish lily the lovely shot of gloria you 're looking at is not misleading . the music inside is just as beautiful as the artist . gloria has long used spanish music to let her artistic soul flourish and this is her masterpiece . this album is filled with beauty . if you love music and you want to hear the best of what it has to offer from around the world , then this is a perfect place to start . once the beautiful `` with the years that i have left '' starts we are transported to an elegant and exotic club somewhere in south america . the sun has faded and a tropical moon has taken its place . the glossy hardwood counters are polished to perfection and the cherry finish complements a scattering of sego palms and spanish lilies as wine glasses are filled with only the finest vintage . gloria 's rich and emotional vocals surround the room and are backed by a lush orchestra and breezy spanish guitars . so rich is the atmosphere we can almost feel her moving around the room and smiling as she passes by our small table . the songs move from love of one 's homeland to romantic love lost or waiting , and everything in-between . gloria fills this room with her magical phrasing of a beautiful language . we hear so many wonderful songs we dare not leave and miss a moment . there are songs of forgiveness and hope , and songs of true love and hanging on 'till the one lost to you returns . one song , the light and playful `` si senor ! '' conjurs up images of the andrew sisters and another time . one of the prettier songs we hear before our time in this moonlit paradise is over is `` volveras '' ( you 'll be back ) . gloria knows the man leaving her for another and taking her heart with him will be back , because he ca n't erase her memory . but we know it 's only a song . no one could be foolish enough to leave this cuban flower . and all at once , it is over , and like all vacations , it has ended much too quickly . but what we 've seen and heard has enriched and expanded our world . we want to come back once in awhile to feel like this again . lucky for us we own this little keepsake of our time with gloria in tropical paradise .
