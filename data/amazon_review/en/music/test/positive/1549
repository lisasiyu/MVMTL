a woodstocker wan na be when i saw this movie , i just knew i had to get this soundtrack . music is from two genres of the time : the clean- housewifey-music , and the hippie-woodstock music , to reflect pearl 's and walker 's backgrounds , respectively . i have to say , though , that whoever thought to keep richie havens ' & quot ; freedom & quot ; off the soundtrack made a poor decision . i made another copy of the cd and added the song myself by downloading it from the web . i now feel it is complete and i have it on continuous play on my surround sound , staring at my lava lamp and wishing for the first time in my life that i were older so that i could have been a part of this great era of music
