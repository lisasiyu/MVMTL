i have a crush on sufjan . it borders on obsession . i think he 's incredibly talented and i love him and all his music . this christmas album really put me in the spirit . it actually reminded me of when i was a little kid and christmas still seemed like a religious holiday . i am now an athiest , but somehow listening to sufjan sing about jesus just makes me happy . my favorite songs are `` put the lights on the tree '' and `` come thou fount of every blessing .
