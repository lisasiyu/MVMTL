yes , you do need the 2-disc edition . i received the 1-disc 'best of bowie ' for christmas , back when i was just a bowie novice . with the 18 or 19 song track list , it was a short listen , but covered all of the basics . the problem was ; i wanted more . i searched every record shop , every ebay auction , until i got everything other than the tin machine albums and 'black tie white noise ' . i am working on getting those now . i finally came across the best of bowie 2-disc edition , and boy am i glad i purchased it ! the first extra essential this disc has to offer is the classic 'the man who sold the world ' . it was so good , it was covered by nirvana ! i consider it to be one of bowie 's finest ; right up there with my all time favorite bowie song , 'ziggy stardust ' . it also covers another bowie essential , 'life on mars ? ' . it 's more of a nostalgical piece , the beginning taking place in a girl 's dreamworld . he actually performed this with the indie band arcade fire . and , of course , it also covers 'oh ! you pretty things ' , which is another classic bowie song off of 'hunky dory ' . other songs that have been put on this album and not on the 1-disc include 'sorrow ' , 'drive-in saturday ' and the slightly controversial 'john , i 'm only dancing ' . the second disc is more of the 'present ' bowie . the first track is off of 'low ' , which many people title 'technologically ahead of its time ' . 'sound and vision ' is one of the most famous songs bowie has ever done , because it was featured on bbc ( i think ... ) the title track off of 'scary monsters ' is also here , thank goodness ! it is such a good song and it showcases bowie 's 'chameleon ' technique . i 'm also satisfied because 'loving the alien ' is also on this ; it 's my all-time favorite bowie song ! it also includes more recent bowie , like 'little wonder ' and 'slow burn ' . the 1-disc bowie is good for beginners , but if you want a real good taste of the most inventive artist in the world , get the 2-disc edition . it covers more ground than perhaps any other greatest hits compilation ( with the exception of van halen , maybe ... ) . you would n't be dissappointed with this purchase . it 's a lot better than getting bowie 's albums as a starter , and then not liking them ... although i 'm sure you would . it 's just that good !
