better then trouble i liked trouble but i think this cd is a little better . i like the musical arrangements better this time around . the addition of john medeski and chris wood give the music a deeper more full sound . trouble sounded mostly like ray playing an acoustic guitar . where till the sun turns black really has some excelent backing musicians . lyrically i like both about the same . i say to get both discs they have alot to offer .
