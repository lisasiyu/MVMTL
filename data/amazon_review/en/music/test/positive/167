a very good collection..more than just the 4 singles boyz ii men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic motown groups ( temps and tops ) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings . this album broke them into superstardom as their followup to `` cooleyhighharmony '' , placing 4 songs into the charts for the philadelphia group . highlights : this album pretty much divides into 2 'sides ' : the uptempo side ( before `` khalil '' ) and the ballads afterwards . most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half . part 1 has `` thank you '' ( the only up-tempo chart hit ) , an infectious number riding a doug e. fresh sample . `` vibin ' '' is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric 's pretty lightweight ( we 're just vibin'/dancin ' the night away/groovin'/vibin'/non-stop until the break of day ) . `` i sit away '' is a tony rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin . ( this and `` nobody knows '' ..is rich clinically depressed or what ? ) in the `` slow side '' , babyface 's `` i 'll make love to you '' set a record for the length of time at # 1 . `` on bended knee '' ( from jimmy jam and terry lewis ) and `` water runs dry '' ( another babyface composition ) also made some chart action . the group shows off their sterling harmonies on the beatles classic `` yesterday '' and they pull off the true feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic . it 's a wonderful rendition . lows : `` all around the world '' is boyz ii men 's rewrite of ricky nelson 's `` travelin ' man '' more or less , but not nearly as memorable . considering how pivotal it is to the album , `` khalil '' is a pretty blah track . `` jezzebel '' is a dull overlong affair . `` 50 candles '' includes the lyric `` holding your body like a plastic molding '' ... .'nuff said . bottom line : there are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself , but the extras like `` i sit by '' and `` yesterday '' make this one worth owning . recommended for r & b fans
