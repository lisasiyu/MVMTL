iceland strikes again ! what a unique and scary cd ! ! : ) minus hails from iceland , the land of rocky tundra and quirky rock groups ( sugarcubes , bjork , sigur ros , mum , etc . ) none of which can hold a candle to meeting the intensity of minus . this is bar none the most unusual hardcore metal album i have ever heard and i 'm loving it ! yes it 's screamy ( well most of it ) , but it 's very melodic with tons of tempo changes to keep you on your feet . mainstream metal this ai n't and it is n't for the faint of heart . if you 're into slipknot and need a bit more attitude ( ! ! ) or more complexity and layers , this might be up your alley ! give it a try ! [ fave tracks : pulse , frat rock and misdo
