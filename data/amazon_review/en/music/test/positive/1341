vintage folk-rock tunes clearly rooted to the mid-70s diamond girl '' is a vintage collection of folk-rock tunes clearly rooted to the mid-70s and one of the finer albums to emerge from that cluttered genre . though seals and crofts were a duo , their fine-honed sound would not have caught the public 's ear without the able assistance of producer louie shelton , who really shaped and smoothed their sound , and multi-instrumentalist jim lichtig , who shares writing credits for several seals and crofts ' songs . a cast of fine session musicians contribute as well , and the set . i would say that nearly all of us who listened to the radio back when this cd was popular will always recognize the opening chords of diamond girl within a millisecond and drew comfort and permission from the philosophy in we may never pass this way ( again ) . this cd has other jewels as well , nine houses , jessica , and wisdom , and all in all contains more baha'i themes than some find comfortable . a pair of older tracks , such as dust on my saddle and standin ' on a mountain top , both penned before there was a seals and crofts , do not hold up as well . note that this cd is not actually a warner brothers release , which may bode well for those , like myself , hoping to see more of this duo 's catalog appear on cd . after their antiabortion stance on a later recording , `` unborn child , '' the band 's popularity began to wane and they found themselves being judged more on politics than music .
