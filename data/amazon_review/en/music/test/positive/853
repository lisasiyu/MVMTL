incredible there is no doubt in my mind that this is the finest recording of handel 's messiah available . as said before by other reviewers , the voices are very clean , unlike some renditions that sound like they are performing a wagnerian opera . these are definitely some of the most beautiful voices i have ever heard ( bravo especially to the tenor ) . diction is excellent . the sound quality is very good , and it is on period instruments . this is one of my favorite sets . very highly recommended . however , i had some trouble obtaining a copy of this recording , and there is a possibility that it has gone out of print , so hurry
