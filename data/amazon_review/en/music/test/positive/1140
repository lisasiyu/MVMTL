`` color tv '' finally at first this was kind of disappointing after hearing epics like `` english settlement '' and `` apple venus '' and `` skylarking '' , but this is actually quite good , sometimes even on par with the three wonders stated before . the cd clocks in at over an hour with the several bonus tracks from singles released from this album and two really different songs from a series of experiments andy did , these are `` frost cirus '' and `` procession towards learning land '' . these songs sound pretty cool , but are n't the better part of the album . the b-sides are pretty amazing with the three catchy songs that could have been a-sides `` jump '' , `` toys '' , and `` gold '' . `` desert island '' is also an excellent song about britain ... . '' do n't rescue me ... no ! no ! no-ohhoh '' ! the actual original mummer tracks shine as well after a couple listens , the singles `` love on a farmboy 's wages '' , `` great fire '' , and maybe even `` me and the wind '' ( it is too far out in the album though , you may want to quit listening before then ) will hook you on first listen . `` love on a farmboy 's wages '' was definitely the first friendly song in the batch on first listen with its catchiness and wit . `` great fire '' has a great drama to it that anyone will like , it is a wonderful tune . colin 's single `` wonderland '' has really cheesy production , so i had to skip it ( it was so strange ) . but it is actually a good song and is more than listenable after a few listens to mummer . the opening tune `` beating of hearts '' is a powerful song that is almost romantic and shows the power of humans that separates us from the animals ... .emotions and `` love '' ! it is no wonder terry wanted to leave xtc during this album , it is a dfferent direction for xtc ... just about a 180 turn . that does n't mean this is a bad album ... by all means it was xtc maturing . the only song that is really similar to old xtc is the `` funk pop a roll '' song , which is pretty awesome and funny . again it is slower and the songs completely different like colin 's `` deliver us from the elements '' is filled with backing vocals that sound like they are from a church choir . andy 's `` human alchemy '' is profound and sounds afircan or something and is really controvesial ... read other reviews here ... it s a really good song with a message . on first listen though production-wise it may be too much to stomach , but it is one of my favorites on here now . `` lady bird '' starts off with andy scat singing and turns out to be a most excellent pop tune . a grand album with some questionable production , but that is the fun of the 80s . recommended for xtc fans , unless you do n't like quiet stuff .
