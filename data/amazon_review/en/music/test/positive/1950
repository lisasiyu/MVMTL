the most overrated classical recording of all time . it 's still good though ... this ultra famous recording of the the beethoven fifth and seventh is absurdly overpraised . i 'm not going to be a mr. know-it-all and attack these performances just because people love them , i 'm just going to try to be fair and impartial and get at the core of why these recordings should n't be deemed so unsurpassable . kleiber is an exceptional conductor and he knows exactly what he is doing , his penchant for drama , attack and drive , work well with these two symphonies but they miss quite a bit too . the vpo for instance is a great orchestra but they do n't always rise to the challenge here . i want to pay particular attention to the sound of these recordings which is simply not that great . it 's servicable , actually typical deutsche grammophon sound from the mid-70s . it 's cold , at times harsh and stringy . the opening of the last movement of the 5th symphony is shrill , there is no resplendent majesty here like you get in karajan 's 1962 version or guilini 's version from the early 80 's with the lapo . kleiber 's first movement is fast , intense but lacks the ultimate power i heard in the karajan and giulini versions . the second movement is good , kleiber does n't rush things , the scherzo is terrific , the transition to the finale does n't have much mystery , certainly not the heaven storming insanity that furtwangler brings to it in his war-time recording from the 1940 's . kleiber is also very literal in his observation of repeats in these works . repeats everywhere you can find them is typically the norm in recent times . the repeat in the first movement is a must , obviously every conductor takes it but the finale repeat is a matter of choice . kleiber of course takes it and it 's to his credit that the movement does n't drag as it might under someone else . giulini 's last movement does drag because he takes a slower tempo along with the repeat . karajan on the other hand , never took the finale repeat in any of his versions , from 50s , 60s , 70s and 80s ! all the karajan versions fly to the finish with unbelievable , exhilarating force ! so with giulini or kleiber , you 're more exhausted by the end of the symphony , with karajan , you 're on cloud nine , ecstatic because of the power of the berlin philharmonic and because he skips the redundant repeat . of course kleiber 's version is terrific but i would not give it this high of a status among classical recordings . here are the best beethoven 5ths , any karajan version , especially the '62 and '77 , the later 80 's digital version is extremely powerful too but not as well played as the earlier versions . they all do pack quite a punch . giulini with the lapo is among the best , then carlos kleiber is up there in that great company as well , but not the definitive at all . if you want a furtwangler 5th , of course there is the war-time performance to go to . it has a slow first movement but the rest of the work is majestic beyond words . unfortunately you have to deal with the mono sound , even though it 's not that bad . the 7th symphony is a tricky one and i 've never been completely convinced by any version that i 've heard . kleiber once again takes all the damn repeats ! it 's ok in the first movement , but he takes one too many in the scherzo and he takes the repeat in the final movement which makes things way too repetitive , many conductors used to skip this repeat but kleiber is so bloody literal minded ! karajan 's versions of the 7th are just too driven for my taste , even though karajan 's finales have always been the best ! the fast speed works well in the finale . kleiber is less driven than karajan and carlos is also more humane in the allegreto . however , all these versions just do n't spark me too much . furtwangler on the other hand is outstanding but of course you have to deal with the old mono sound . you can find his version on the music and arts label . in addition , check out the very weighty , traditional approach of christian thielemann with the philharmonia orchestra on a recent beethoven record , with great sound that easily surpasses the sound of the kleiber and karajan recordings . what you ultimately have here in kleiber , is pretty intense , terrific performances but with some catches involved . the sound is not great , the vienna philharmonic lacks the unbelievable virtuosity of the berlin philharmonic and kleiber insists on all the repeats just like most recent conductors and that tends to make things drag in the 7th symphony . all reservations aside , they are still great performances but this is surely not the holy grail of classical recordings !
