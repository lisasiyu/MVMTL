real nice underground i like this tape alot ( or well the cd-version ) . i dont get how ppl can dig the new stuff from 3-6 at all , thats just lame club music . the old stuff has the good beats ... but oh well its always the same story : at first they make real good songs just to get rid of anamosity , then comes the deals the money the industry and they start to produce crap for the mass .
