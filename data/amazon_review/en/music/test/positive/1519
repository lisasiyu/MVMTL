this album is truly a musical gift this album fell into my life by accident and i am glad it did . this album is a wonderful combination of wit/humor , earthiness , and tender moments . the lyrics combined with his rough and deep voice are wonderful . not a word is wasted nor out of place . this album is a & quot ; keeper. & quot
