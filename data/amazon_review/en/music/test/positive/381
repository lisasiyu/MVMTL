this is wonderful ! gene harris is a true master of his craft . this quartet makes beautiful music ; this group is one of which i want all their recordings ( and i 'm in process of getting it ) . the mood of the music is very uplifting ! the audio signal is clear , as are all concord records i 've bought . this quartet consists of gene harris on piano ( and band leader ) , ron eschete on guitar , jeff hamilton on drums , and the late great ray brown on bass ! all ten tracks are beautiful , beautiful
