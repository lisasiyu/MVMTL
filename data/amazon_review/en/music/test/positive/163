a very good debut album sheryl crow has become one of my favorite artists . several of my favorite songs appear on this album . run , baby run opens the album in good form . leaving las vegas is next . strong enough is probably my favorite song by sheryl ever . i love the acoustic guitar . all i wan na do turned out to be a major hit for her and probably launched the career . i shall believe is another great song . this is a must for any fan of sheryl crows
