beethoven rediscovered ! ! ! ! ! i was curious to listen to david zinman and the zurich orchestra after all i had read in the cd guide books and magazines . this is my sixth full cycle ( karajan 1963 and 1977 , klemperer , bernstein/vpo and toscanini ) and these days is definetely my favourite . zinman brings new life to the symphonies- period . the barenreiter edition may play a role in the freshness of the music but the passion of maestro and orchestra makes you feel as if you are present in the music hall , being a spectator of a live performance . the first symphonies were the greatest surprise for me , and i can now see the maturation of beethoven , where as the older approaches interepreted these pieces as small `` eroicas '' . there is no doubt there are better interepretations of individual symphonies out there - ex . carlos kleiber on the 5th , klemperer on the `` eroica '' -old style or furtwangler on the 1952 recording of the `` choral '' - but this fact can not overshadow what i find as an excellent set at a great price
