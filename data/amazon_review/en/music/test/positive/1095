miles playing real jazz this 1961 club date was miles ' first ever authorized live recording and it features a quintet miles was to discard a couple of years later in favor of a newer , younger group . the music of the later group ( featuring wayne shorter , herbie hancock , ron carter and tony williams ) was an experimental group that played around with timbral innovations , unusual harmonies , atonality and rapid tempo changes , leading all five members of the group to later experiments in jazz-rock fusion . the music they produced was inaccessible to many and its status as true `` jazz '' has justifiably been questioned by those who believe jazz must be fundamentally rooted in swing and blues . the jazz status of this 1961 group , however , can not be questioned . it is arguably the last true mainstream jazz group that miles ever led and these recordings show the group at its best . for me , the highlights of this set include cole porter 's `` all of you '' in which the talented and underrated tenorman , hank mobley , delivers a magnificent , powerful blues-oriented solo that upstages the understated miles himself ! mobley 's characteristic tone is unmistakable . miles ' own `` so what '' is even more impressive here than the famous version on the kind of blue album . the modal song is taken at a brisk tempo and miles ' solo is incisive , hard-driving , and completely assured - a masterful performance . mobley 's solo is also a fine one , and pianist wynton kelly delivers a typically fleet-fingered , exciting solo of his own . miles ' mastery of melancholia shows on monk 's `` round midnight '' which miles performs brilliantly and movingly , though the other solos are not as noteworthy . miles again shows his lyrical mastery on the lovely romantic johnny mercer ballad , `` i thought about you '' . backing miles , mobley and kelly are miles ' longtime bassist paul chambers and drummer jimmy cobb , both of whom are consistently solid . if musical experimentation in the free jazz or fusion vein is what you like , then this album will probably seem unprogressive and unappealing to you . if , however , you prefer the mainstream jazz tradition as represented by the likes of armstrong , tatum , parker , monk , gillespie , and rollins , then you wo n't likely be disappointed by these performances . they represent one of miles ' best and last contributions to the mainstream jazz tradition .
