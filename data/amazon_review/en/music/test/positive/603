no slump here gary allan skipped the sophomore slump with his second album , something that usually plagues new artists , but he seems comfortable on his 1998 album it would be you . the album has the right balance between uptempo honky tonks and touching ballads . the album opens with the title track , one of his stronger singles . & quot ; no man in his right heart & quot ; recounts a night where a man turns down a woman 's offer , an offer no other man would refuse . & quot ; do n't leave her lonely too long & quot ; was co-written by marty stuart , its a fun honky tonk sure to please . & quot ; i 'll take today & quot ; was another single from the album , a nice ballad about cherishing the time we spend in the present instead of relenting on the past . other nice sentimental ballads include & quot ; i ai n't runnin ' yet & quot ; and & quot ; baby i will & quot ; , and he does honky tonk on & quot ; i 've got a quarter in my pocket & quot ; and & quot ; red lips , blue eyes , little white lies & quot ; . the album closes with & quot ; forgotten but not gone & quot ; , a beautiful ballad , one of the best on the cd . there 's also a hidden track called & quot ; judgement day & quot ; which is worth listening to . overall this is a nice album , i think better than his first , so give it a listen
