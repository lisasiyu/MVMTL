a satisfying musical journey over the years i 've gotten weary of people ragging on mingus because it does n't meet their expectations - it does n't sound like joni mitchell should , it does n't sound like mingus would have wanted it to , it does n't sound like jazz should , etc. , etc . listeners should get over all that and appreciate it for what it is - a challening , beautiful , eclectic , and even mystical musical journey . it 's holding up beautifully all these years later .
