lyrically and truthfully brutal ! ! ! alice ... you are a smart christian , you tell it how you see it and you see it correct , now all you have to do is stop hanging around with that bum rob zombie . anyways , onto the album ... its great , not so melodical and not as great as the last temptation but still awesome , its heavy , deep and the lyrics leave a lasting impression . also i would like to add how great his latest album dirty diamonds is , it varies in song styles with great production and catchy tunes geniously written . just remember , god is great and alice is cooler than cool
