derailers - soldiers of love this is my first derailers album . i had heard of them before , but never really wanted to buy an album . i think i 've been missing out on a great band ! derailers ' `` soldier of love '' is good - really good - i 'm tempted to give it 5 stars but that 'll be determined if i 'm still listening to this 5 years from now . for now though , this is great `` americana '' music . this is what real music is about . this is where country music started , where it has evolved to , and it 's nice to see how it can still sound good in the year 2006 . the songs are really good throughout - start to finish . the lyrics and choruses are very catchy without being cheesey - except for the `` get 'er done '' song - that phrase is so played out by now , you 'd think they 'd have known better . this album takes honky tonk , country , rockabilly , and mixes them all together to make a great album . it 's a record for good times and cold beer . it 's nice to hear real good , quality `` country '' music every once in awhile
