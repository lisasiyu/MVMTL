delectable me oh my , what an outrageously good record this is . i had never heard of the stone roses until my brother played me & quot ; i wan na be adored & quot ; a few years ago . i loved the song , but i thought they would be a band very much like the smiths or the cure ( which is n't a bad thing at all , i just was n't interested at the time ) , so i never followed up and bought any of their albums . thankfully , my father received this cd from my brother for his birthday a few months ago , and i 've had the pleasure of listening to it everyday since then . all of these songs exude an indomitable vitality that lends an extra cachet to the already stellar music . there is a distinctive 80s sounds to the roses , but after listening to all the material present on the very best of , it 's apparent that these songs transcend their era and will always remain as timelessly great pop confections . highlights of this recording include the ebullient & quot ; what the world is waiting for & quot ; , the dreadfully pleasing & quot ; i wan na be adored & quot ; , and the anthemic numbers & quot ; made of stone & quot ; and & quot ; i am the resurrection & quot ; . i highly recommend this to all
