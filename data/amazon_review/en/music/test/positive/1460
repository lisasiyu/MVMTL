the best .38 album ever ! ! ! i 've been a fan of .38 since their first album , and this ranks from first track to last as their best effort in my opinion . don barnes and donnie van zant each lend their distinctive voices to such rockers as 'chained lightning ' and 'back door stranger ' . the guitar work of barnes and jeff carlisi was never better . southern rock at it 's finest ! !
