pure pop rock i bought this the same day i bought nevermind by nirvana , and to this day this album ranks higher on my list of favorites . maybe it 's because i was just a kid when i first heard this , but it sounds so vibrant and original . yeah , the band utilized two bassists to form their sound , which sounds gimmicky until you hear it . basically , they had a guitarist and bassist playing the rhythm/backing parts and one bassist playing the crisp/trebly lead , which gave their sound this bright and aggressive feel . and john penney 's voice is perfect for the music ; it 's a little angry , a little strange , and a little hopeful . this band wo n't be remembered as an `` important '' band ( like nirvana , pearl jam or other bands coming up at the time ) , but i do n't think they would particularly care to be . this is music made for the moment , and sounds pretty pure because of that
