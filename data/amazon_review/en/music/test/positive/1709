`` we 'll sing 'em all and we 'll stay all night ! '' if there has ever been a better live album than judy at carnegie hall , i 'd like to know what it is . simply exhilarating in audio , one can only imagine what it was like to be in that audience in 1961 . how did they manage to not spontaneously combust ? there are so many spin-tingling moments that one is hard-pressed to choose a favorite . from the subdued and sublime ballad if love were all to the raucous tributes chicago and san franciso , judy covers all the bases and hits a home run every time . even when she forgets the lyrics , as she does in you go to my head , she does it brilliantly and with charm . i 've owned this album in one form or other since i was a kid in the 1970s and i never get tired of it . even if you think you do n't like this kind of music it is an amazing experence . buy this . buy it now
