the shepp to get ! as an earlier review states , shepp tended to have some dead spots on his earlier releases . this on cooks from start to finish ( which includes two great tracks from his & quot ; kwanza & quot ; lp ) . the addition of piano makes this set his most accessable impulse cd . the piano reinforces the feeling of the blues which as always been present with shepp , but here there is no denying it . highlights include & quot ; frnkenstein & quot ; and & quot ; bakai. & quot
