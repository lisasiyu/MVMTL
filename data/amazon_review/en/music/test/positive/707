very talented work hello there , i just want to say that the corrs dvd audio has very great sound , i had the opportunity to listen to normal cd audio but this is better , you could play it better on your own computer 's dvd player as well , corrs is the best band on planet , since i used to listen to them , february 2004 , i could n't stop hearing their tunes one to another , now they will be releasing their new album `` home '' at october 2005 , which it 's gon na be greatful ! , oh i forgot , g. parsons `` ugh . '' , it 's a pitty that you do n't like the corrs as i do , but please do n't try to humiliate them , i know you are a good human being as everybody , corrs have their own prestige and it 's not a subject of discutio
