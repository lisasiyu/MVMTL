an awesome cd this is one of the best albums i have ever heard . there 's no songs on here that i do n't like . all of them are great . especially i 'm just a kid , i 'd do anything , and perfect . i reccomend this to anyone who likes bands such as yellowcard , the all-american rejects , and blink-182 or anyone who is looking for some good music to listen too
