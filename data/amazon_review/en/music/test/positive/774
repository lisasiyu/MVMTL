wow ! this is my seventh evans recording and it is like i am getting to know him all over again . this album has energy , freshness and joy that just is n't there on later recordings . the recording quality is more than satisfactory . the group 's playing is smart and engaging with a skillful balance between technical skill and understated musicality . the playfulness brought to standards like witchcraft is a welcome contrast to many of his later more brooding works . lafaro and motian provide their legendary support and interplay with their typcial flair . this was definitely a high point for evans , before drugs , bad health and personal problems got in the way . no evans collection would be complete without this recording
