a timeless classic `` step in the arena '' did feel a lot like an debut album than a sophmore release , not taking anything away from `` no more mr. nice guy '' but that album was more like a demo record . whereas `` step in the arena '' was a peek into the future as to what was to come later for gangstarr . guru 's veteran type flow/hungry new coming mc intensity and premier 's bass heavy jazzed out beats made this album a timeless classic which could go toe-to-toe with the new material being release today . any true hiphop head needs to have this cd in their collection .
