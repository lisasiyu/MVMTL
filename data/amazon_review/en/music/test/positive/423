we need more rough cutt it 's bands like these that make the 80 's shine.too bad they did'nt make more releases.what 's really sad is that a lot of rock stations do n't even play this.paul 's voice is very distinctive , also got his solo stuff.so if you get the oppurtunity buy this and any of paul 's cd's.this is elite compared to the likes of kickaxe and black n blue.all in commin with great hard rock and songs that have hooks all over.and to mention they all did'nt make it big , what a shame !
