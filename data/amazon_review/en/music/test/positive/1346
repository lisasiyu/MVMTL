essentially it an amazon search of 'essential ' under music turns up over 1,700 hits . while they may not all be winners , if you 're looking for an affordable one-disc compilation of janis joplin recordings , you could n't do much better than this . the nice thing about '18 essential songs ' ( drawn from the 49 track 1993 box set titled 'janis ' ) is that a number of the selections are alternates or live versions of well-worn tracks , so you get a little different spin on the joplin legacy . in addition , you get nearly every truly classic recording janis ever made spanning over seventy minutes of cd space . at under five bucks for a used copy here at amazon , you may be able to end your search here . the offerings begin with one of janis ' earliest recorded tracks , a rendition of the blues classic 'trouble in mind ' . although it is historic , janis ' vocals seem to be struggling to emerge from a cave . hit the skip button after a cursory listen , and move on to the goodies . 'down on me ' , while not as deliciously raw and punchy as the live version recorded at the grande ballroom in detroit , certainly kicks janis ' locomotive vocal cords into high gear . familiar studio tracks such as 'piece of my heart ' , 'try ( just a little bit harder ) ' , 'kozmic blues ' , 'move over ' , 'get it while you can ' , and 'half moon ' mix with a previously unreleased version of 'ball and chain ' ( all eight minutes plus from the 1967 monterey pop festival ) , an alternate demo take of 'summertime ' from the musical 'porgy and bess ' , a live version of 'raise your hand ' from the ed sullivan show ' ( a portion of which made it onto the 'very best of the ed sullivan show ' video compilation ) , and a nearly six-minute live wailing blues version of 'tell mama ' . most refreshing is the closer , an alternate demo recording of 'me and bobby mcgee ' , featuring just janis and an acoustic guitar , melting this composition down to its essential elements . 'trust me ' is offered as one of the few non-blues or rock oriented tracks . it 's a nice romantic ballad , but comes too late in the set to be breaking up whatever monotony is induced by the dominance of the blues . a few lesser-known tracks such as 'i need a man to love ' and 'one good man ' might make things interesting , but are less than essential . the only 'essential song ' i could without is the mercilessly overplayed 'mercedes benz ' , which graciously clocks out at 1:46 as the shortest track on the disc . '18 essential songs ' is a compelling entry into the janis joplin compilation sweepstakes , which features two full box sets , and at least 10 single disc 'greatest hits ' style collections . if you 're not inclined to purchase one of the anthologies , however , this may well be the pick of the litter .
