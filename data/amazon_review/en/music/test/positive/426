more than a decent album i keep reading reviews of rainbow albums as decent or average , which is an understatement . while rainbow never reached the musical heights of deep purple , the band was , in it 's own right , influential in creating the gothic hard rock sound that so many derivative 80 's english metal bands embraced . i admit that i am biased in blackmore 's favor , but that 's because he is that good of a guitarist and quite underrated . listen to each song , but do n't waste your time on `` if you do n't love rock and roll , '' which elicits about as much emotion as watching lichens growing on rocks . however , `` man on the silver mountain '' and `` self portrait '' are 70 's metal classics
