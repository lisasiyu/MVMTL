a 'real good ' and 'intimate ' live album when the corrs deliver it 'live ' , they deliver it real good . whether it is 'covers ' or 'originals ' , it is as good a live album as i have heard . the intimacy with the audience is evident and all the songs stand-up well 'live ' . in my view , this is the best 'corrs ' album out there . bono pops up on two tracks as an added bonus
