for the piano lover oh , wow ! this is a cd that will be liked by all who enjoy david lanz , mehdi , george winston , yanni , or even secret garden . it is the very essence of good new age . so tranquil , yet so spirited ( and finally a picture of the kern on the coverart ! ) , this cd is a refreshing break from my well-worn collection , i just keep wanting to listen to it over and over again . i am amazed ! it reminds me somewhat of george winston , but still very unique . this is music to the soul . absolutely relaxing , as well . i also recommend : mehdi ~ instrumental heaven volume 7 ..truly a gem ... samples are at soothingmusic , com ... just listen .
