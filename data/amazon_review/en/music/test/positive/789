the absolute best primer for jazz initiates while my musical tastes span a wide range of genres , i 've long been intrigued by jazz and the blues - both are enigmatic and haunting , yet not exactly a part of popular music today . so it was with great expectations that i purchased this set , hoping for a strong foundation upon which i could explore the giants of jazz - and eventually work my way down to contemporary jazz artists . this collection fits that bill beyond compare . some favorites i already knew are here , such as glenn miller and benny goodman - along with sublime jazz geniuses such as coleman hawkins , count basie , and charlie parker . sure , as other reviewers have noted , the set is a bit heavy on louis armstrong and duke ellington , but i doubt you 'll be disappointed with any of the tracks included here . aside from the wonderful music , you also receive an informative and beautifully designed booklet . it includes not only an essay on the origins of jazz , but a song-by-song write up that 's unequaled by any other collection i 've purchased . i 'm more than up to date on jazz music , as well as gaining a profound appreciation for the genre . simply put , if you 're curious about jazz as i once was , this is the absolute perfect way to initiate yourself into the library of jazz . ( on a side note , if you want a great blues primer , i 'd suggest the martin scorsese set .
