unbelievable first off to avoid any conflict of interest claims i admit that i an a huge rod stewart fan . that being said , i just was n't interested in hearing him do the old american classics ( which i also love ) . i just did n't see how he could do them justice , that is , until i saw his dvd `` live from royal albert hall '' in which he did several of the songs from his first `` great american songbook '' . i was just blown away . these songs were now his . i went to the computer to order one of the cds but my wife talked me into getting all three and i am surely not sorry . i believe that there are very few cds available with no weak tracks ( there are some ) but here are three that just do n't have a weak track ( imho ) . he has made all of these great songs his . my all time favorite song is `` stardust '' by hoagy carmichael . i had never heard a version that i thought could top his , until now . if you love the old standards you should really give these 3 cds a listen . they 'll melt your heart ! ! !
