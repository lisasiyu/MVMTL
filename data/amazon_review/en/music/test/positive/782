it is never the end when you are a fan for life the doors continue to be a band i have new experiences with . it is a great tribute that presents the mystical sounds and strange songwriting that is only capped off by the voice and presence of jim morrison . this two cd package is an integral part of my music collection , but more importantly it is because it is a truly great collection of their music . even if you are a younger person who is new to the doors , this is a great place to start if you so choose ! i had the original set and later retired it to acquire the digitally remastered version shown here on amazon . all the classic door songs are here , which on the first cd include songs like `` break on through '' , `` love me two times '' , and the dark and dreamy `` spanish caravan '' . cd number 2 is no less important with songs that range from `` l.a. woman '' , `` riders on the storm '' to one of my favorites called `` the unknown soldier '' . overall it is an amazing collection of hits when you just take a step back and look at what you get if you purchase this
