jusst looking at the controversy ... generated in these reviews tells me there 's something important in this album . here 's what i think ... sometimes you hear a tune and you say , `` wow , what a great copy of the beatles . '' a clear example of this is the knickerbockers ' sixties tune `` lies . '' a great tune , upbeat pop all the way , with no pretensions to anything but turning a buck with a beat . god bless ya , my boys . to my knowledge , the knickerbockers are memorialized in the room at the rock and roll hall of fame devoted to one hit wonders . but the song is still a great copy of the sound that made the beatles the dominant force in a half century of pop music . anyone who wants to debate this point can meet me at the side of the podium after the lecture . but this album , `` bellybutton '' by jellyfish , is a subtle , loving , and cleverly complete tribute to the beatles . in its 10 songs , jellyfish captures virtually every era and accomplishment of the beatles , from thier earliest days of raw enthusiasm/talent/new harmonies , through the psychedelic growth years , to the era when the inexorable forces of the beatles ' unprecedented fame were driving them apart even while they made thier most innovative and insightful music . even this album 's artwork is a subtle evocation of the now-classic sergeant pepper cover . jellyfish members have clearly studied music of virtually all genres ( ok , i do n't think i hear any c & w in this recording ) , and the mix of influences in truly entertaining . the songs are each little magic showcases for the impressive talents of this now-gone band . every one tells a story based on conditions and emotions -- heartbreak , shame , addiction , loss , longing . the musicianship is outstanding . arrangements pay tribute to the kind of work that made george martin a vital element of the beatles ' success . i like the album a lot , even though it is more than 15 years old . i keep returning to its spot on my ipod . it never fails to snap me out of a bad mood and run me through a gamut of emotions in a short 45 minutes . it 's a great example of why music is so important to so many people
