burrell & trane burrell ( g ) coltrane ( ts ) tommy flanagan ( p ) paul chambers ( b ) jimmy cobb ( d ) 3/7/58 . trane was in his `` sheets of sound '' period at this time , and he and burrell make a good pair . freight train is an up-tempo blues that is excellent ; another blues on the cd is big paul , which at 14-minutes is just a tad too long . never knew and lyresto , both taken medium-up , are also very good . flanagan is his usual impeccable self . excellent early work by all the musicians involved
