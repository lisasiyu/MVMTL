when my mind is numb playing tricks on me and the world is crashing ... i 'll start off with the thing that will get me unhelpful votes , but it needs to be said . i 've heard very few songs by kmfdm so my introduction to lucia came in the form of revolver magazine . without ever truly hearing her voice i decided to get from the land of volcanos . that was nearly a month ago and this cd is still in heavy rotation . this has been one of those cds to escape with . for the 54 and some odd second running time , you 're in a completely different place . lucia 's voice and the lush melodies sweep over you and you lose all sense of time . few cds do that so to find one that does it , and so successfully at that , is quite the relief . whether the song is of the harder variety or just as relaxing as can be , at no point does this record stall , it moves swiftly , which is , ironically , my only gripe with it as well . from the very beginning of so clever i figured i was in for quite a ride . so clever is just a solid song , nothing more . breathy vocals through the verses turn into an ear catching chorus . i do n't care has some of the best lyrics on the disc , plus the chorus pretty much soars . fear is a lyrically driven song . it serves as a true highlight as well . feels like summer is probably my second favorite featured . 'instant classic ' comes to mind whenever i hear it . a pulsating beat with some pretty intense moments only serve the song more justice . what you become has a nin feel to it with a repetative chorus , not my favorite but good for a few listens . who asked you creeps along with a certain sensuality to it . i will goes down as my favorite song featured . the chorus is irresistable , that 's basically what it boils down to . monkey puzzle tree kind of grated my nerves at first but now i really like it . nice lyrics and excellent chorus . ordinary girl rounds out the true cd nicely . the chorus is kind of eery due completely to lucia 's vocals . i love the pace of this song . the kmfdm verson of monkey puzzle tree strikes me as more of a reprise than a remix . either way , it 's still a great song . my favorite songs are so clever , fear , feels like summer , i will , and ordinary girl . if you 're like me and have n't been properly introduced to lucia , well this is the perfect way . this cd is truly amazing and i can only hope that when i venture into kmfdm 's catalog that they 'll impress me as much as lucia has with from the land of volcanos
