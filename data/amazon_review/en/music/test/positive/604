the awesomest album ever ! dude , nobody rocks it like the hoff ! as hard as it may be to believem his musical talents actually equal-maybe even surpass-his skills as a thespian ! i was first exposed to the hoff 's amazing vocal talents when he guest starred on the classic series , kids , incororated . imagine how exciting it was for a young tyke to see knight rider singing on saturday morning tv ! y'know , knight rider was probably the greatest series ever about a talking car , but they really dropped the ball by not having the hoff sing more . maybe even a duet of the hoff and kitt of ebony and ivory . knight rider would 've been like 37 bajillion times awesomer if it was a musical like cop rock . cop rock rules ! but i 'm not reviewing cop rock , i 'm reviewing the hoff 's awesome retrospective album , which is a great overview of the hoff 's career , altho obviously , you 're going yourself a disservice to not buy the original albums ; a lot of great stuff there . but if you want an album that rocks the house , this is the one for you . dude , i hope when they do the movie of knight rider it 's a musical . that 'd be the awesomest movie eve
