johnnylongstreet it is true that this is a great collection of songs . with that said , here are two complaints : 1 ) the audio snippets from the movie are built into the tracks , so they 're tougher to skip through . 2 ) the audio transfer is terrible . somewhere in the process , either at the transfer or the mix , the audio thinned out . there 's a really weak bass end , and everything sounds thin and tinny . not that it ruins the experience , but for someone who 's actually into how music sounds , you might look elsewhere
