beautiful , lovely cd i saw jon randall play live with emmy-lou harris in nottingham earlier in the year and was amazed by his angelic voice and his lovely songs . this cd is just wonderful and with some highly talented background singers helping him with bone achingly beautiful harmonies , you ca n't go wrong
