stellar performance even if i were not the photographer who contributed the cover photos i would rate this album as a ten . for this release , sonia has cooked up a band of incredible talent and passion which drives her songs to a whole new level of glory . an added bonus is sister cindy 's vocals on the kerrville tracks which connect this recording to the past of disappear fear . this new incarnation of disappear fear rocks and its sound can only go up from here . it is as spontaneous and as fixed in time as sonia 's smile on the cover . got ta love this one
