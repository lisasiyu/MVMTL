ladies in lavender cd the film `` ladies in lavender '' is touching and a tear jerker , but , so well done . having the film on dvd was not enough , i needed to have the cd to play when i am driving . the violin virtuosity of joshua bell is magnificient and so pleasing to hear when relaxation is desired
