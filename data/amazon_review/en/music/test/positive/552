damn good . better than her others i always liked nelly furtado for her originality but this new cd is very different than just about anything else out there . it 's difficult to define a genre for it as it 's very diverse . i was n't sure if i would like it as i found her other cds good but a little weird but on the contrary , i enjoyed the entire album . this is really a great album
