perfect . i bought 'on land ' this afternoon and have been playing it constantly -- it 's been round about six or seven times already . the first time , it sounded utterly familiar , like music i 'd heard a long time ago and forgotten . every time since , it sounds different and new . i already had 'music for airports ' and 'plateaux of mirror ' ( with harold budd ) , but 'on land ' has convinced me that eno is , without exaggeration or qualification , a great artist . even his liner notes are intelligent without being pretentious , a rare achievement for a musician ! although very superficially similar , it does n't take long to realize that eno 's ambient works are a world away from the lazy , sonically unadventurous tinklings of countless 'new age ' pieces ( many of which were probably inspired by eno , unfortunately ) . in 'on land ' every sound is meticulously placed , every treatment thoughtful and , needless to say , beautifully produced . moving away from the idea of 'performable ' music towards pure studio recordings allows a degree of control -- crucially , control of tonal contour and spatial organisation -- that makes these tracks more like aural sculptures than music . that 's probably why they sound so different on different systems , in different rooms , at different angles from the sound source etc . if that makes it sound like an academic exercise , be aware that this is also a very emotional record -- although the emotions communicated are usually obscure , ineffable , almost impalpable . whereas some of eno 's other ambient works are explicitly not to be listened to directly , i ca n't help feeling that 'on land ' demands more focused attention . it will certainly repay ; after just a few hours , it already feels like one of my favourite records
