toothsome pop the box and you see an egon schiele drawing , an attenuated early modernist nude wearing her anxieties on her skin . it 's a fitting visual reference , for the willowz are a nervous band , also a raw , ambitious , self-challenging , brilliant and perplexing one . they have great hooks , a gift for casually tossing off little bits of humor and beauty , and this timeless unselfconscious quality that 's easier heard than described . in the bland stew of indie rock , the willowz are a toothsome morsel .
