faith in george ! after that wham ! broke up it was almost inevitable that george michael would become a solo star , he had already had a solo hit with `` careless whisper '' `` a diffrent corner '' and his duet with aretha franklin `` i know you were waiting '' was also a hit . `` faith '' was released in 1987 and it also sold around 10 millions copies , it was without a doubt george 's most comercially succesful album . `` faith '' shows maturity but it also continues with catchy uptempo songs that wham ! were famous for , it 's a great mix between effective soul-pop like the title track and slow personal ballads like `` father figure '' . it also had a great streak of 5 # 1 hits on the billboard charts . george also became the first white male artist to reach # 1 at the r & b charts . first single `` faith '' is a catchy uptempo that almost became a trademark for him . it starts with a face-up organ for most of the song but eventually a one-chord guitar is introduced too . it 's a hell of a song . `` father figure '' is a far more moody song , infact it 's a soulish ballad that feautures gospel choirs and a somewhat mysterious sound . both faith and father figure were # 1 hits . `` i want you sex l & ll '' is indeed 2 diffrent version of the song , it 's 9 minutes long . the first one is soul-pop but the second in more retro-soul with horns , something that phil collins would have been proud of . the song was considered very controvercial upon it 's release , both the title and the lyrics were offensive to many people and the song was banned from certain stations and would only be played at late night on mtv . the song was a # 1 hit in us nonetheless . `` one more try '' is a touching ballad about a man not willing to get into a new relationshiop cause he had been hurt so many times before . it was his 4th # 1 hit from `` faith '' . `` hard day '' was never released on single but would have become a hit too i think . it 's a uptempo song that reminds me of `` i want your sex '' . `` hand to mouth '' was also a non-single , it a great touching slow paced song about the american dream . it tells the story of 2 diffrent people that both want to experience the american dream , but none succeeds one shoots at people and the other one ends up becoming a prostitute . critizism to reagan 's america , simular to the recent single `` shoot the dog '' towards bush . `` look at your hands '' is a jazzy song that also brings up social issues , this time domestic violence . `` monkey '' is a catchy uptempo aswell , it was his 5th # 1 hit and it 's not hard to understand why . the ballad `` kissing a fool '' only reached # 5 and was the last single from this album . it sound alot like the upcoming material he was going to release later on . the upcoming song are remix of `` hard day '' and the last one being a third version of `` i want your sex '' this one is very slow paced though . overall , a great solo debut for george that not only sold incredibly well but also is flawless from song 1 to song 11 . all songs are worthwile , and he makes a good mix of catchy uptempo 's to touching ballads . a 80 's classic without a doubt
