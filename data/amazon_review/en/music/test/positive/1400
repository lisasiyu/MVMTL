the best live album ever made ... between 1971 and 1976 , roxy music were in their `` hip '' phase and they were one of the best live acts ever , and still are today ( ca n't wait for their new album ! ) i was not around for their 70s touring ( *or for that matter , their manifesto-avalon tours , i was born in 1991 ) . here is what i say about roxy music : move over pink floyd ! out of my way led zeppelin ! the who , this is n't a parking lot ! roxy music were the best band in all of the world and will always retain that position , with three frontmen : bryan ferry- the best singer in rock history and the best looking andy mackay- his saxophone playing will blow you away phil manzanera- his guitar playing is world-class and to top it all off , you have the great paul thompson , the most energetic drummer ever ! his drumming is not one little bit out-of-time . and of course , there 's the magnificent brian eno + eddie jobson who were the group 's synthesiser players from 1971-73 and 1973-76 respectively . jobson also played violin , which just added another coolness point . these guys are the only band that matters ! and they did n't sell out but still knew what top of the pops was ! only drawback to the album : not enough songs ! no three + nine ! no mother of pearl ! and no love is the drug ! otherwise , i give this 6 stars ps to everyone who says the clash were the only band that mattered , you guys suck
