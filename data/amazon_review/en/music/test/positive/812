best hiphop album of the year this band was on the great hiphop group for the late 1980s . they pretty much did everything that was innovative fifteen years ago . public enemy and nwa got more attention at the time . they paved the way for other innovators like beastie boys and de la soul . ten years later they would influence the prodigy 's the fat of the land . kool keith would continue and make great records later . but this was back in the day of the fade haircut . that was the hype thing to do . each song on this record is a hit . `` ego trippin '' is some of the hardest hitting slamming music of all time . `` traveling at the speed of thought '' is an example how advanced they were lyrically . public enemy was more political and nwa was more gangster . ultramagnetic mcs were like poetry in a way that tupac shakar is n't . `` give the drummer some '' is one of their best songs . like public enemy , they were influenced by the beats of james brown . critical beatdown is one of the great albums of all time . it needs to be recognized . this album also contains six extra tracks like `` a chorus line . '' this is where things started . the 1980s were a harder time for hiphop to get known . this record reminds me of mike daley . we used to listen to hiphop and play video games .
