roy 's favorite this was recorded during a tour of japan in the late 70s . roy stated that of all the albums he released this was his favorite-many of the others he refused to acknowledge . listening to this cd helps the listener understand why roy thought so highly of this album- roy was on that night and the band was tight . my only complaint is that the whole show is n't available . this is the editted show , some 46 minutes of the two hour event . still if your a fan of this amazing guitar player you owe it to youreself to pick this cd up along with american axe to hear this guy make that guitar cry
