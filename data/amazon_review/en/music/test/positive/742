beautiful ... makes me think of the film ! this is a wonderful album that is filled with color and life ( not unlike the movie ) . we have a great cross-section of sounds represented here . `` rose de castilla , '' a beautiful , all-vocal song , takes us back to michoacan , where the sanchez family gets their start , before the father , jose , walks across the border to los angeles ( `` a line in the dirt in those days '' ) . we also hear the energetic music of the 1950s ( `` angel baby '' by jeanette hurado and `` que rico el mambo '' by perez prado ) . this transports us to the lives of the first generation of sanchezes , born in the united states , raised by their mexican-born parents . we also have some lively merengue ( in the form of `` guavaberry '' by juan luis guerra y 4.40 ) . you all will love this cd ! ! !
