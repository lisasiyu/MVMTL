a surprise to me well , i get this cd only a few days ago in november 2004 . i was surprised about quality of his voice and of the entire cd . he had the ability to create music of a certain type without being repetitive . i especially appreciate `` til i get over you '' , `` the only one for me '' and the title track `` anytime '' . so dim the lights , hold tight your girl and let the music play ... .
