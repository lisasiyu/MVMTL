one of my favorite hip-hop albums.. i love this album.. every track fits perfectly.. this is good hip-hop the way that it 's supposed to be done . i do n't know which track i would consider my favorite since overall i like every one but i would say that the beat to t.r.o.y is just plain out awesome one of my favorites of all time . if you want some hip-hop look no further check this out . you will not be disapointed . justi
