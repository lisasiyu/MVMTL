new dimension for underrated singer-songwriter joseph arthur has been quietly gaining a deservedly fine reputation for his emotionally raw , yet very well crafted songs . breaking away from the realworld label , where he released the excellent 'come to where i 'm from ' and 'redemption 's son ' amongst others , he has added a richer more polished layer to his honest lyrics and affecting music . none of the tracks reached me as immediately as favourites , such as 'in the sun ' , 'september baby ' or the beautiful 'honey and the moon ' but soon enough a few gems appear . 'echo park ' and 'a smile that explodes ' are standout tracks in an album that rewards the listener throughout . his vocals focus on the higher register more than past outings , which is refreshing , but this is as characteristic and interesting as ever . some tracks may be more geared towards an american audience , such as 'leave us alone ' but there is plenty to keep the british listener entertained , too . appearing on lauded soundtracks such as the oc and shrek 2 , and supporting rem , his unique style and gravely voice have already won him quite a few fans but this new album should see that growth continue . recommended .
