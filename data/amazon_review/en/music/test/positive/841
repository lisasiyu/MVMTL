perfect for meditation and yoga i 'd have to disagree with the review that called this & quot ; new age kitchenette music & quot ; . i find it difficult to meditate to music that has a lot of polarity to it or forces me to listen to it instead of listening to my inner self . the songs flow together . it may seem repetitious at times , but the songs are subtly individualistic . this group is anything but 'americanized ' . they 're a great blend of indian , arab and african flavor with a dash of celtic . the music also is the ideal pace for yoga as well , yet soft enough even to sleep to
