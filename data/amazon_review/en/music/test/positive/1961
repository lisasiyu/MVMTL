brava sarah ! this is undoubtedly my favorite cd of the last decade and definitely sarah brightman 's best effort to date ! her duets with andrea bocelli and jose cura are outstanding ! i especially love 'o mio babbino caro ' , alleluja ' , and 'la wally ' . sarah 's uniquely sensual style is evident in the incredibly beautiful 'bilitis - generique ' , 'no one like you ' and 'just show me how to love you ' . close your eyes and drift away ... it is highly unusual for me to like every song on a cd , but on 'time to say goodbye ' , i do . it has a unique way of making me feel completely relaxed while encouraging me to sing along at the same time . it 's long past time for a sequel to this wonderful album
