a personal favorite by renaissance this 1975 release shows renaissance at a peak and the excellent music on this album certainly reflects this - it is a personal favorite in fact . i really appreciate the craft that the band put into their music ; not to mention the emotional sophistication and superb musicianship . this album is an especially fine example of these qualities . the music of renaissance is very disciplined ( i really appreciate this ) for a rock band and the instrumentation and playing style is more in keeping with a symphony orchestra than a rock band . keyboardist john tout uses the acoustic piano exclusively with some minor pipe organ and harpsichord work , along with a string synthesizer - it is used effectively throughout the album and marks a point where john started using synthesizers more . electric guitars are absent and michael dunford employs both strummed and picked parts on the acoustic guitar , which further emphasizes the classical approach . in fact , it is only john camps virtuosic bass playing on a trebly rickenbacker bass and to a much lesser extent , terence sullivan 's drumming that lend the rock aspect to the compositions . to emphasize the classical `` thing '' even further , an orchestra is featured on this album , and this may very well be their most classically influenced record . saving the best for last though , annie haslam has one of the most stunning altos i have heard - the delicate textures of her voice are both positive and uplifting . the pieces on scheherazade include a single short track ( the vultures fly high 3'04 '' ) , two pieces in the mid-length range ( 7'05 '' ocean gypsy and trip to the fair 10'51 ) , and finally the massive multi-movement scheherazade suite ( 24'37 '' ) . the suite is a very sophisticated piece of music and is extremely well-arranged ; with dense ensemble work and breathtaking dynamics . the scheherazade suite is incredible and my favorite composition by the band - i think it neatly sums up everything that i love about their music . in addition to the suite , there are some absolutely beautiful and haunting moments on this album including the track ocean gypsy , although all of the other pieces are very strong . this remastered effort by repertoire is not too bad at all and features great sound quality along with a brief band bio and a few photos . in summation , this is a wonderful recording made during the period of peak creativity for this band ( 1973-1977 ) and is very highly recommended to prog fans that also appreciate classical music . if you like this recording , also check out ashes are burning ( 1973 ) ; turn of the cards ( 1975 ) ; and novella ( 1977 )
