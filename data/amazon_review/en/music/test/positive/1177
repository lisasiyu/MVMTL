great album this was one of those impromptu buys . had n't ever heard of her before , just liked the clips and said , `` why not ? '' there is n't a single bad song on here , so how often does that happen ? she 's a screamer for sure , but it 's still melodic and not too downtrodden . her range of styles is impressive , too . not too many screamers can do the ballads so well : -
