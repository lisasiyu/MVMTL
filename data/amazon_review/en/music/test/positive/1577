i pledge allegiance to firewind allegiance is masterpiece of music and metal , seamlessly woven together in gigantic proportions . firewind has produced a classic album in the midst of a revival of metal . i 'm a child of the 80 's , when metal ruled the world . i have never been so excited as bands like dream evil , dragonforce , hammerfall and more bring back metal to the forefront . firewind breathes some fresh air into the once dying beast of heavy metal . crisp , clear and powerfully vibrant vocals , extremely intricate and heavy guitar work , bass guitars that wo n't stop all synchronized with awesome drumming ( complete with double bass drums ! ) at times the vocals sounds like a blend of anything jorn lande has done mixed with a touch of david coverdale of whitesnake fame . i just ca n't stop listening to the song called `` breaking the silence '' ! if you love metal , old or new , this is a must have for any true metalhead
