great guitar , grating vocals . granted , it is obvious that the guitar work here , is worthy of placement among the best blues records out there . but as always , winters vocals range from the grating , to the almost comical charactures , they devolved into later ( and not much later at that ) , in his career . the guitar work deserves 6 stars , minus 2 for the vocals = 4
