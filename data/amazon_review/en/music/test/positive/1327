bing was unquestionably the king of christmas music there are plenty of christmas cds by bing crosby that you could get , most of them are at least as good if not slightly better than this one . however , one very good thing about this cd is that it provides bing crosby in very good voice singing christmas standards at an excellent price . these recordings were from old radio shows , and , while that means that there is a mild radio hiss in the background . i personally think that this adds a little magic and character to the cd . if you agree and are on a somewhat limited budget , then you should definitely think about adding this crosby classic to your christmas collection
