great concert these four discs have some of the greatest music from back then . the 8 songs performed by the great jimi hendrix are worth it for any jimi fan . the recording and version of his popular & quot ; purple haze & quot ; is the best i 've heard . this cd is truly on of his greatest performances . the who 's performance was also awesome , for it was their first show in america . their explosive songs amazed the crowd , and shows some of townsend 's best . these two performances are the highlights , but theyre are also many other tremendous performances with some of the best recordings i 've heard
