why emo was good once i 've had this album forever and it , to me , is an expression of emo when it was : ( a ) as a term , a much more precise description ; and ( b ) as a body of work , good because it coupled actual musicianship and intelligent lyrical talent to garner such a true expression of raw emotion that to listen was to live that emotion , in a phenomenological sense . to this day , & quot ; the new hangout condition & quot ; ( from which comes the cd 's title ) and & quot ; today or tomorrow & quot ; are favorites of mine . while my predecessor reviewers are right that this album ( and , truly , karate ) will never be & quot ; amazing & quot ; , they can best be described as & quot ; honest and true & quot ; , which is also valuable
