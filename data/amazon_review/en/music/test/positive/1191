why does it have to be one or the other ? the concerns raised about phair 's last two album are hardly palatable . the general concensus seems to be that either : 1 ) she 's a total sell-out , angry rock was her only voice 2 ) she 's way better than she used to be , softer is good why does it have to be one or the other ? people say she 's losing her tough edge , some say she 's got a new bead on life . i do n't see this as being one type of music or the other . i see a great songwriter and passionate person going with what makes her happy - not resentful music for the reality-impared outsider or love music for the overly-sappy contemporary , but well produced , thoughtful works of art that refect something different with each release . i 'm not saying that this is `` the freewheelin ' bob dylan '' or anything , but it 's also miles from britney spears . phair 's music has always been just that - phair 's music . so if it 's not what you like , get over it . it 's not about you . it never has been . if you do n't believe me check out her itunes original album . and play on liz , play on
