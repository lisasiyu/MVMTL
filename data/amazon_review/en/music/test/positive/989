$ $ $ unless you 're a big fan some people want to collect anything that says final fantasy on it . if you 're one of them , like me , then get this . the lm box set has only the 2-disc soundtrack in the box . the box is there to hold the soundtrack , the gackt lm redemption cd/dvd and the ps2 game . it 's a very pretty box and the soundtrack has 53 songs on it , including the new singles ( longing & redemption ) from gackt . amazon.com 's importing price is outrageous though . find a local importer for this one , it 's only 3,900 yen
