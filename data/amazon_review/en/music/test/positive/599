a worthwhile purchase more than just a one hit album , `` i wish '' has enough pleasing and catchy tracks to merit a purchase . the production values are high , with some great backup vocals and instrumental work . in addition to `` i wish '' , `` this is how it sounds '' and `` crenshaw '' are solid . really , other than the last track , `` i wish ( street mix version ) '' , this is an entertaining album across the board with some interesting turns of phrase . skee lo 's lyrics move at a fast cadence but flow with the back tracks nicely and pause from time to time to permit room for the background singers to jump in smoothly .
