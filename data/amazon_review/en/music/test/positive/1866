dan 's still the man ! ! ! ! ! ! i remember seeing dan fogelberg in concert when i was about 15 or 16 years old . awesome ! after seeing him in concert , i became a fan ! the power of his music and song have deeply touched me ! everytime i hear & quot ; leader of the band & quot ; , i am moved . it 's such a heartfelt tribute to his father . every picture tells a story -- and dan tells a fine story behind each song . to sum this album in five words or less : beautiful and relaxing
