bad religion is my religion this is definently one of my favorite albums of all time . anyone who thinks punk rock can not be intellectual , should check out bad religion , especially this album . suffer is good from start to finish , even the songs that do n't stand out as much at first , grow on you and become some of your favorites . get this album or no control , they are both great . the rest of their albums are actually pretty mixed in my opinion . a few great songs and some not so great ones . against the grain is pretty good and fans of old school punk will like how could hell be any worse . the rest of their stuff , like i said is mixed , but none of it is bad . but suffer and no control , just about an hour of music , are enough in my opinion to name them great . suffer is though , probably their best . if you want thought-provoking , fast , melodic punk , or if you like pennywise you will love this album .
