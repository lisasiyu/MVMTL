it 's a roller-coaster ride that never stops whenever i listen to this album i think i 'm at an amusement park and i 'm going on these fun rides . the orchestrations for la cage aux folles are excellent and so is the sound quality . i will never stop listening to this musical until i am at old age . everybody who is anybody should have this musical because this musical has extreme spirit that never halts until perhaps the 2 ballads here in this show . i could be riding on a motorcycle when listening to all these upbeat numbers and i 'd stop at a red light during the ballads . man , this show is even better than hello , dolly and/or mame only because they do n't have as extreme an excitement as la cage aux folles . in my opinion , this musical is like no other jerry herman musical , a musical with music to be played at amusement parks ( especially the rollercoasters )
