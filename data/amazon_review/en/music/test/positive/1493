a revelation revisited i have been listening to this record for about 25 years , so when this newly engineered release came out i was eager to hear the new tracks . they are stunning . i once loved a boy is especially tender and tinged with that slightly bitter , ineffable joan baez melancholy that no other singer i know of in folk music has captured . there is and has been no other voice like this in popular music . listen to this cd and you will put down every other singer songwriter du jour for a long while . this is in another dimension
