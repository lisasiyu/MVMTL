another excellent release from moonspell moonspell 's 2003 release is another one of my favorites right next to `` wolfheart '' . this one is almost as good as their first but comes up short in some areas . it is their second best release , in my opinion , but doesnt have as much atmosphere as `` wolfheart '' did . it 's good all the way through which is important , because an album that weakens near the end is never good . my favorite tracks are probably `` from lowering skies '' , `` antidote '' , `` capricorn at her feet '' , and `` walk on the darkside '' . here are my track ratings ... 1 . in and above men - 10/10 2 . from lowering skies - 10/10 3 . everything invaded - 8.5/10 4 . southern deathstyle - 8/10 5 . antidote - 10/10 6 . capricorn at her feet - 10/10 7 . lunar still - 10/10 8 . walk on the darkside - 10/10 9 . crystal gazing - 9.5/10 10 . as we eternally sleep on it - 8.5/10 overall : 94 % a- it 's another solid release from moonspell . anyone into doom metal would enjoy this . it 's also just the way i like it , sprinkled with growling vocals and regular vocals , because i 'm not a fan of songs where the screaming/growling vocals take up the entire song . anyway it 's one of their best , in my opinion , so if you have not already checked it out , you probably should .
