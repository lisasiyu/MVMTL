i just do n't know what to do with myself either excellent , excellent , excellent ! i love this raw sound of the white stripes that does n't sacrifice the melody . jack shows he is one of the best rockers out there ( and meg , well , you got ta love meg ! ) . standout tracks are seven nation army ( which sounds like salvation army ) , ball and biscuit ( i love to crank up the solos ! ) , i just do n't know what to do with myself , you 've got her in your pocket , and even in the cold , cold heart ( you go meg ! ) . yes , the drums are choppy in places , but it works well with the white stripes and you got ta admit - there is no one else like them . they are original and are here to stay
