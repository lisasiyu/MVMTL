no masterpiece but still a good album released in 1997 . `` be here now '' was oasis third album and their last near great . at the time of it 's release oasis was among the most popular rock bands and whatever they made was turned into gold . there was no exception with `` be here now '' that proves the bands craftmanship and lives up to the hype surroundig them . at first listen i thought that the album was a little overproduced with too much commercial appeal but the album is aging well and looking back at it now , i believe that `` be here now '' is an very strong album . afterall it was their last that sold really well all over the world and gave them several big single hits . the music is far from surprising , if you liked their first 2 albums and noel 's songwriting you will enjoy this one aswell . i think some songs were a little too commercial , but on the other hand it got loads of energic rockers too and it shows the bands diversity and craftmanship . `` do you know what i mean '' is super long with it 's 7.42 . it was also a pretty big hit in europe but at the same time it also suffers from being too long and overproduced . oasis had always done simple songs but for the first time on `` be here now '' their success had gone to their heads , it feels forced with it 's lenght , sound effects and solo 's . having said that , it 's not a bad song but not what we wer used to . `` my big mouth '' is a classic rocker , that would have been great for their debut album . `` magic pie '' is also too lon with 7 minutes , it 's a midtempo that noel sings . `` stand by me '' was a hi single , and a quite typical oasis song , midtempo , good chorus and good sing-a-long . it 's defenitely one of the better songs on this album . `` i hope , i think , i know '' is yet another rocker . `` the girl in the dirty shirt '' is surprisingly good eventhough it was never a single release . a poppy midtempo . `` fade in out '' is half-acccoustic with little instruments used and a soewhat bluesy sound , although it does n't stand out at all . `` do n't go away '' is a ballad , and one of their best songs . the song is about losing someone that stand close to you , unfortunately it was only releases as a single in japan . `` be here now '' the title track is another trademark midtempo rocker . `` all around the world '' that also was a single-release suffers from the same thing as the opener . it 's too long with 9 minutes , it 's overproduced ( just look at the music video ) and it 's also too commercial . sure , neither this one is bad at all , it good a meliodic chorus and has got a wonderful beatleesque ending with sing-a-long and heavy guitars , but it was a little too much . `` it 's getting better '' a rocker and a reprise of `` all around the world '' closes the album . overall , oasis last near great album . even if it got it 's faults and is weaker then the first 2 albums , it got it 's moments with both rockers , midtempo pop/rock and one very good ballad . the main problem is that some songs are too long . the whole album clocks at 70 minutes and was 25 minutes longer then the average oasis album . at times it 's just becoming too much and it feels like oasis success has gone over their heads and were trying to be something they were n't at times , but needless to say , it is a good album with a fair share of good songs and looking back at it now it brings back memories when oasis were at their peak and rules the charts . 4/5 stars . good purchase
