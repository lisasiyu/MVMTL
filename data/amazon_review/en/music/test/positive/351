ludacris - chicken n beer decent album here by ludacris . i actually give this album about a 3.75 rating . i liked ludacris older tracks/albums better . but this one is decent , for southern music that is . i think the production on this album is pretty good , gots some good beats here n there , some tracks are garbage , most are pretty good . lyric wise , he does good on some tracks , some his lyrics are garbage . got ta watch out . if your a fan of ludacris , i dont find a reason why you wouldnt like this album . half of it is good , half of it aint that good . check it out before you cop it . but its good for southern tastes . my top 5 songs 1.hard times 2.screwed up 3.hip hop quotables 4.teamwork 5.we go
