leaves you motionless while your mind races out of control ! ! if you 've listened to enough trance mixes you may already be familiar with bt . for example : bt 's godspeed and dreaming are featured in some of dj micro 's mixes ( dj mixed & micro-tech mix 2.0 ) . if you can recall , these tracks have been more than entrancing . this cd contains the whole package including those two amazing tracks and the other featured tracks in this mix is incredible ! it is difficult to make a decision off the bat whether or not to get this cd since amazon does n't have a preview feature . but trust me , i took the plunge based on the reviews alone and i could n't have been more pleased . here is a breakdown of some tracks on the cd : 1 . ) movement in still life - this track is the intro to the cd and starts off with a skit phone call , with some guy ( who sounds like some beat junky ) talking , saying he wants to make some fresh hits . it 's funny because he says to call him back @ his mom 's house and if he 's at his grandmas , call his pager . as cheezy as this sounds track 1 quickly transitions into some hard hitting beats with a nice urban b-boy feel to it . 10/10 6 . ) dreaming - this is a nice track . it starts out a little slow and gradually brings you back up to speed . this track features vocals by kristy hawkshaw whos voice is very soothing . some insight to some of the lyrics included in the chorus are : `` no words no talk , we 'll go dreaming ; no pain no hurt , we 'll go dreaming . '' near the end of track the vocals reverb and fade into some motivating beats . 9/10 7 . ) giving up the ghost - this track follows the previous track almost by suit and carries the same trance beat with some new sounds and synthesizers . since this cd is a continous mix , i believe this track was included to support the next selection . whether or not that 's fact , the transition between these two tracks ( 7 & 8 ) are very tasteful . 8/10 8 . ) godspeed - here is where you want to turn up the volume , adjust your highs and lows , turn the bass down a few notches so the deep base on this track does n't drown out the inspirational feel . as this track spins above the lasers of your cd player , the ground beneath you feet seems to vanish and leave you in suspense . the enticing female vocal quivers elate your senses and unexpected booms and repercussions of the base send you freefalling , landing within the tides of machine beats sending you to a far away corner of your brain so you can trance out . i give this one an amazing 10/10 . 10 . ) running down the way up - this is one of my favorite selections . this track starts out with an acoustic guitar interlude for about 20-30 seconds , then some attractive female vocals come to the forefront . the vocals really set the scene and are heard throughout the the entire track . what makes these vocals all the more appealing , the begining vocals are whiped with exotic reverbs and channel mixing which make this track what some refer to as `` ear candy '' . then the excitement ends with impressive electric guitar rifts and licks . i classify this one a 10/10
