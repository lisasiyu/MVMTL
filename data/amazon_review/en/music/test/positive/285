this album is near perfect . this and dark side of the moon are the most balanced records pink floyd has ever produced . just the right amount of sax , synth , drums , guitar , and vocals . the album is a little different than their ealier stuff as it has mostly a possitive sound to it , in other words do n't come from the wall listening to this without giving it some time . the only thing in question really are the `` a new machine '' tracks , which are certainly different , not something you would just jump into . will you ever like them if you do n't like them inittially ? probably not . but other than that , everything else is utter perfection for the style of music they represent . listen to this album a few times and trust me , you 'll love it
