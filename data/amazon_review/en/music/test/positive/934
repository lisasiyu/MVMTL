would 've been 5 stars if it was n't for the outlaws look , it 's not that i do n't like the outlaws , in fact i have much respect for them for bein loyal and true to pac , but to be quite honest , lyricly , they might be the worst group of rappers iv'e ever heard in my life.the fact that this album went double platinum tells you everything you need to know about 2pac 's popularity more then anything else . okay hussein fatal ( who for some reason is n't even on the album ) was cool and kadafi ( r.i.p . ) was okay , but the rest of them , at best , were a little below average.i ca n't tell you how many pac songs they 've brought down because of their obvious lack of lyrical talent . with that being said , i really do think that this was a good album . the stand out tracks for me are `` mr.president '' , `` secrets of war '' ( pac comes off nice on this one.he also has an unreleased verse on this song ) , `` homeboys '' , `` the good die young '' , `` killuminati '' , `` hell for a hustler '' , '' baby do n't cry '' and `` tattoo tears '' . my favarite song on this album has to be `` hell for a hustler '' . pac 's rage and emotion on this song is unbelieveble . `` whatching over me threw every murder scene '' `` guess you can call me anti-social , n****z shaken like they caught the holy ghost when i approach you '' . bottom line , if your a fan of 2pac then you should probably snatch this album up because pac 's lyrics on this album alone is worth the price even though he 's only rapping on 1-2 verses per song .
