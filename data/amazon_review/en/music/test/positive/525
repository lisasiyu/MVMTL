good collection of songs eddie cochran rocks , this is a must have for any rockabilly fan or any fan of rock n roll ... ... ..the real stuff . it 's too bad he had to die at such a young age , it would 've been nice if he could 've been around to make more great music , with songs like `` jeanie jeanie jeanie '' , `` somethin ' else '' , `` come on everybody '' , `` guybo '' , `` summertime blues '' , `` twenty flight rock '' , and my personal favorite `` bolweevle '' ( do n't know if thats spelled right , but its a really cool song ) . this is an enjoyable album from start to finish , this is the way rock n roll is supposed to sound
