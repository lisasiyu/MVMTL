awesome instrumental ! ! ! i have been addicted to this cd for months . i heard one of the songs on the new age satellite channel and thought i 'd give the cd a chance . the entire cd is awesome . the music reminds me of enigma , deep forest , and medicine woman ( except no fruity bird sounds ) . sure enough , as i checked out some stuff about kevin wood , it said his influences were : enya , patrick o'hearn , deep forest , sacred spirit , enigma , and george winston . if you like the sounds of those musicians , you 'll love this cd . the piano pieces are exceptional and every song has a good rhythm/beat . if you take a chance , enjoy
