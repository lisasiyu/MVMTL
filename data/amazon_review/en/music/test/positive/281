enjoying it this is the kind of cd that you do n't skip over any tracks on . you ca n't help but to knod your head and tap your fingers to each beat and imagine being in a small intimate venue hearing the songs being played live . most of the songs are kind of fast . great driving cd . favorite tracks : 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 11 and you got ta love track 13 ( also on his previous cd ) .
