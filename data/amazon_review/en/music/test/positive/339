truly , a `` timeless '' album ! ! boy , when i first listened to this tribute to the famous hank williams sr. , i thought , `` wow , how different this is ! '' . i got ta tell ya , all the artist 's on there do a fatastic job ! tom petty 's version of `` you 're gon na change ( or i 'm gon na leave ) to my estimation is about the best cut on the album . emmylou harris ' version 's of `` lost on the river '' and `` alone and forsaken '' are just wonderfull and emmylou 's version of `` alone and forsaken '' is about the best version i have heard of that song by another artist . i do have to say that the worst of all takes on the album is johnny cash 's `` i dreamed about mama last night '' . thank goodness it 's the last song on the album . maybe it is because i never liked the song in the first place . i do like johnny though . the true hank sr. fan will love this ablum . especially if your a music fan
