just listen ! i read some of the other reviews and thought it was kind of silly for people to try and analyze which bg album is better ... .what does it really matter ? this is a great ( band ) and they create thoroughly terrific music . i happen to think that talk to la bomb is pretty fantastic , unlike anything else that is out there . let 's remember just how horrible and bad the music industry is right now and let 's just enjoy talented musicians like bg that go unnoticed for the most part , except by critics and nobody listens to them anymore either !
