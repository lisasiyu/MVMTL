`` ya ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight ? '' just to make things clear , i 've never owned any prince albums , and therefore ca n't consider myself a fan . most people seem to judge these songs by comparison to his other work , but i 'm speaking from a completely neutral point of view when i say : this album is great ! i remember i bought this back in the early 90s thinking it was danny elfman 's score to the film , and returned it when i realized it was actually a soundtrack by prince . so , over a decade later , when i read that jack nicholson himself supported the use of prince 's talent for some of the movie 's music , i figured why not give it a shot ? i figured right ! all nine tracks have their own style and place , but the best ones are full of dance-able funk and hook , like `` the future '' , `` electric chair '' , `` partyman '' , `` trust '' , and `` batdance '' ( you got ta dig that breakdown ) . it has that feel-good electronic goove that 's the epitome of 80 's pop music . and as a nice little touch , there are several songs that use audio clips from the film ( namely nicholson 's napier/joker character ) that really keep the bat-atmosphere alive . i 've long been a fan of gotham 's characters as well as jack nicholson , and now , through this , i think prince may hold a spot on my list . basically said , `` batman '' the soundtrack is a must for anyone who loved the movie
