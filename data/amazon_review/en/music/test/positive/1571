el corazon this recording will ground you to the earth , reconnect you with the soil you came from . there are many fine , beautiful compositions here . i listen to them while bathing , along with the music i use oils , incense and candles , it is a preparatory ritual . the beginning vocal track & quot ; omiya & quot ; is an uplifting spiritual piece from the heart . another fabulous composition is & quot ; red hibiscus on skin & quot ; a soft synth track with flute and other instrumentation . & quot ; biki is insulted & quot ; is a heavy drum laden warrior piece with accompanying vocals which sound similar to a tribal chorus . & quot ; a cry from the heart & quot ; is a somber and compelling layered male vocal piece complete with deep space atmosphere , it is the introspective 'dark night of the soul ' experience . i must add that it was quite some time until i actually appreciated the majority of kama sutra . you may have to let it sink in also . when you are sinking into your hot bath water allowing your heavy oils to penetrate your senses , it will happen . it is most proper to use oils that correlate well with this recording , such as sandalwood , patchouli or dr. singha 's mustard bath ( i use this product ) . enjoy this life-altering music
