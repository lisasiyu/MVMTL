the hits and more if you are looking for the hits of billy joel , this is the place . all of his major hits are here and in one place . there are no live cuts , no alternate takes , just song after song from one of the best musicians of the last 30 years . if you have some of his other cds , you may quibble about some of the choices on the set . for example , i have a soft spot for `` leave a tender moment alone '' and that is not here . but that is minor . the 4th cd in this set is a gem , from his talks on the `` business '' of music , how records actually do get made . you get a feel for joel as a person as he talks about growing up as he explains how and why he wrote songs such as scenes , vienna and piano man
