the road to future greatness in 1963 , the kelly/chambers/cobb rhythm section packed up and left , leaving miles davis without a band . despite being at an age when most musicians would rather sit on their laurels and play on some giants of jazz tour , he decided to assemble a new working band . this cd shows that assembly in progress . the three ballads were recorded in la with george coleman ( tenor sax ) , victor feldman ( piano ) , ron carter ( bass ) , and frank butler ( drums ) . & quot ; basin street blues & quot ; is very different from louis armstrong 's version -- davis 's trumpet playing is much sadder , merging abstraction and the blues . but the real treasures in the set are the three tunes recorded one month later with carter , coleman , and two younger musicians : pianist herbie hancock and drumming prodigy tony williams . williams , only 17 years old here , generates an incredible level of excitement on & quot ; joshua & quot ; and the title track . these may be the most exciting up-tempo tracks davis had recorded since & quot ; two bass hit & quot ; and & quot ; straight , no chaser & quot ; . the quintet with coleman , hancock , carter and williams would soon evolve into one of the trumpeter 's greatest groups , and this is where they got started
