excellent ! this cd is one of his greatest . i 'm glad he released this one because it sure got nice and worn out in my car . the first song , he comes out hard . i wish he would have sung more of these songs at his concert that i attended in the fall . he still wants to wear out his til shiloh cuts which indeed are classics but he is so talented that everything he comes out with is a classic . but this too bad cd is nothing to fall asleep on . get it if you do n't have it already
