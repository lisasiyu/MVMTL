it 's delirious . this is a very strange album . it features a lot of imaginative sonic `` experiments '' . such as instruments recorded at half speed or double speed , and then played back at normal speed . also vocals or instruments recorded backwards and then played forwards . it 's all way ahead of it 's time , and it should be of interest to anyone who likes unusual music
