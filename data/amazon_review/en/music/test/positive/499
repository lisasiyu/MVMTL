bebe & amp ; cece 's best nearly every song on the album is up to the same high standard set by the title track , & quot ; heaven. & quot ; the tunes are memorable , the instrumentals enhance the vocals rather than being barely-noticeable fillers , and the lyrics are a refreshing change from the hackneyed lyrics one often gets on christian radio stations . as one of the other reviewers has said , this drew criticism from some , but anyone who listens carefully will see that the christianity is there . it 's subtle rather than in-your-face , and thus does n't get tiresome . & quot ; heaven & quot ; is an album that can and should be listened to over and over
