a different kind of cold i have been a long time fan of cold . the newer more mellow cold is definately the best sound they have produced yet . the third album `` year of the spider '' is not too far behind and that is for sure , but the old cold was not as emotional and vocally talented as the the new cold . cold has lost some talent intramentally , yet i do n't see this as a bad thing . scooter ward is so talented vocally there is no need for instruments to attempt to drown him out . give ward the stage ! this fresh sound from cold is certainly implemented in the title track , as it is only ward and his beloved piano for the most part of the song . the intruments are there but there is certainly no need . the song writing ability of ward can not be matched by anyone in the rock genre . this is a kind of parent-friendly grunge-flavored soft rock that 1-ups every kind of alternative rock out there which seems to be all screams and f-bombs nowadays . if you like rock this is the album for you . if it does n't hit the spot the first time try round two and you will agree
