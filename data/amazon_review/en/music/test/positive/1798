sneaks up on you i scored this record from the buck bin yesterday . the owner of the shop looked at it like maybe it should n't have been in there but sold it to me anyhow . he said i should run home quick and listen to it because james booker is a revelation . right he was - when side one finished i did n't even flip over the record , i just plopped the needle right back at the beginning . it may just be solo piano and a little singing but the sound is big , beautiful , complex , soulful . one of those rare records that make me kick myself over all the years i spent not listening to it .
