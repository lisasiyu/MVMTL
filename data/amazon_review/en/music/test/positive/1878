catchy , heavy songs with a wide range of vocals at one time , i was pretty much a sucker for all nu metal that was kinda underground and was n't out for the money . now , i find myself listening to few bands , such as fear factory , type o negative , and machine head . i 've pretty much abandoned all the other guys . so why does switched fit in ? because they pull off emotion in great variety and it 's not simply sounds battering your ears . along with these guys i definitely recommend from zero , who can be compared to these guys except more on the melodic side
