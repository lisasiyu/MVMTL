beyond praise and time edith piaf died in 1963 . her chansons ( = french for 'songs ' ) live on . even stronger than that : the more time passes by , the more one realizes how breathtakingly good they are . though definitely set in the mid-20th century , piaf 's voice , style , timbre ( = french for 'rhytm ' ) and choice of repertoire effortlessly deal with any passage of time . setting does n't matter at all , and the same goes for the limited recording technics of her days . being widely recognized as the 'soul of france ' , piaf carries her chansons to the most extreme corners of planet earth . right up to this day . in europe her 'non , je ne regrette rien ' ( = no , i do n't regret anything ) makes the greatest impact : the 'life goes on'-undertone of this chanson still brings inspiration & courage to millions of her admirers . 'non , je ne regrette rien ' also reflects piaf 's own life : being of very modest origin , she surely had to put up a stiff fight to gain her immortality . she did so by finding her inspiration in a deep & uncompromising love for her native france . as only a limited part of humanity speaks french , piaf 's achievement is all the more impressive . one should realize americans & english always have an easy ride : 50 % of the world 's population speaks their language , while the other half adapts to it for reasons of efficiency . no , surely any number of stars is n't enough to reflect on edith piaf 's chansons . their quality takes this mid-20th century chansonniere beyond praise and time .
