kiss review i must give a nod on my site , here , to kiss . since this album is chock-full of the best of kiss , i will thus toss this one into my eclectic mix of a review site , here , of the books , music , and movies i so appreciate - and any song that i recall hearing that literally caused me to turn around and stare at the radio in wonder at what i was hearing definitely gets a top , all time favorite spot on my site . i think i was washing the dishes when i first heard one of kiss ' early , trend breaking records , `` love gun `` . the stucture of the song , the voice , the sound ; loved it . also , i recently heard the kiss classic , `` beth '' , playing quietly over the muzak system at the grocery store . that took me right back to the seventies ... and i realized that `` beth '' -as well as kiss -has quite well stood the test of time .
