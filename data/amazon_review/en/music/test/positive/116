favorite dcfc album when you listen to a cd , why do you listen to it ? simply because it sounds cool , or you enjoy how it relaxes you , or it fits a certain atmosphere ? if that 's how you listen to cd 's , do n't bother getting this album . i would n't want you to . this album is best enjoyed by those who listen to something because they get the feeling inside of it . i do n't know why so many people here call this album pop and lighthearted . i completely disagree . the lyrics are not particularly dark , as opposed to maybe , lyrics from alice in chains ' `` dirt '' , but they are n't exactly happy either . i absolutely love them . `` sleep spent '' is a great song . there is a lot more to this album than everyone seems to let on . the key to dcfc 's music is that it takes a lot of listening before you actually get it , and the emotional value begins to sink in . i have been listening for three years , and just in the last six months or so , has the meaning of their music , the emotion behind it , the depression , sadness , and confusion finally begin to show themselves through the tone of ben 's voice and the guitar riffs . i 'm not suggesting this is a depressing album , in fact it 's rather comforting . most of their albums are .
