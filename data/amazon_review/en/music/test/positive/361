an absolutely beautiful recording the cast in this recording is absolutely phenomenal , and the music of john bucchino showcases the depth and beauty of his talent . each song is a heartbreak , starting with creel 's stunning `` unexpressed '' to porter 's poignant `` grateful . '' the performances are stunning , and the lyrics so simple yet so enlightening and a perfect complement to bucchino 's sweeping music . the orchestrations are supposed to be simple with only the piano as accompaniment , but that is all this cd needs . these are cabaret songs , and thank goodness this cd has come to showcase the best of bucchino 's work and this talented cast . it would be a travesty not to have this recording . every song is a delight , with my favorites being : unexpressed sweet dreams playbill that smile love quiz a contact high [ ridiculous , but very clever ] it feels like home it 's only life this moment taking the wheel gratefu
