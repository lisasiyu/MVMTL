mediocre for slayer , but an excellent piece of metal nonetheless i think it 's quite obvious at this point that slayer is an unstoppable machine of headbanging bliss that has little chance of losing its massive fanbase . they 've come to be loved for their uncomprimisingly brutal take on thrash metal and the fact that they stick to their guns like no other band . even when a hint of change is detected in their work , it 's still slayer and it 's still satisfying . this strength is especially apparent with diabolus in musica . slayer has been going at it for over twenty years , and most of their songs have followed a strict code of conduct -- namely the speed . some people complain that dim leaves this aspect of slayer 's talent behind . not so . it only reduces the amount of it -- and what 's so bad about that ? the trademark thrashing style is still found here , only it 's accompanied by more of the slower , brooding riffs and drum work that , in earlier releases , did n't really dominate . does slower mean less heavy ? absolutely not . i think it actually helps the music and gives it a darker feel . not to mention makes the faster parts even more pronounced . for one thing , the myth of `` slower equals boring '' is clearly busted throughout the album . as far as the music and song structure goes , i did n't think it sounded like `` filler '' material at all . these are classics in their own right . you ca n't expect reign in blood or other definitive slayer albums to be surpassed , and i think the band is well aware of that . the riffs are still heavy , mean , and at times -- in a completely non-melodic way -- even catchy . the lyrics and vocal work are also a nice touch . with dim , araya is leaning more toward the shouting style that would later take on practically every line in god hates us all . a little more like a mix , though , between the old and new . the only low points in the singing were the breathy , moaning tones he used sometimes ( thank goodness this usage was rare ) . it reminded me of marilyn manson or even some of these numetal bands . but by all means , contrary to common criticism , dim is far beyond numetal . as mentioned before , it 's still obvious slayer material , just a bit evolved . luckily , the lyrics stay firmly planted in that moody , anti-religious , almost poetic atmosphere slayer has always had . and as for the whole `` get lombardo back on drums '' deal , i did n't find bostaphs 's playing to be a problem at all . he adds his own taste in there , with some pretty good double bass throughout the album . so for those thinking that the absence of lombardo might kill the mood , do n't worry . the whole band delivers the goods as usual . then again , how could they not ? diabolus in musica is a pleasant surprise . while it is easily overshadowed by the slayer `` classics '' , it stills lives up to the legendary band . it never falls off the line of hard'n'heavy mayhem that fans love , yet manages to give a little bit of an alternative approach at the same time . no matter the differences , it is a fine piece of metal and belongs in every slayer fan 's collection
