santana goes back on top moonflower put santana back into the charts , and back into the major music mainstream . this is the first platinum album since santana iii in 1971 . moonflower went on to sell ten million copies worlwide . the two preceding albums , amigos and festival , got santana out of the heavy jazz fusion genre , and back into more `` radio friendly '' afro-cuban rock , like the early days . a few hits came , e.g . dance sister dance , let it shine , let the children play , etc . but not until she 's not there did santana really crack the charts . the whole album is extremely good . all of the live tracks are superb . there is not a single weak spot on the album . the bonus tracks are extra . the album would be just as good , maybe even better if the bonus tracks were n't there . they are completely unnecessary , shortened versions of the original versions on the album . but you can just skip those . get the album
