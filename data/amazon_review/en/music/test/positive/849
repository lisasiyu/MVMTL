mark o'connor plays everything this is a terrific showcase for o'connor 's remarkable prowess on the fiddle as he moves flawlessly from one style to the next , cajun , bluegrass , old-time , he tackles it all while surrounding himself with some of the best country musicians i have ever heard such as steel guitar player paul franklin and piano player matt rollins . mostly these are up-tempo instrumental tracks but there are also a few vocal tracks included . if you want to hear musicians playing for musicians , this is a great cd
