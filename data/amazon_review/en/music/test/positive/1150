at long last i have been waiting for years , nay decades for this long-lost album to be released on cd . this , the first of karen dalton 's only two albums is , in my opion , the better of the two . karen dalton has a voice that demands to be heard for one of the most exotic aural experiences we have in the archives of pop music today . while i have been able to convince a few people that this is lady day singing , the arrangements just wo n't wash for such a deception the be successful for very long . this is a voice that sounds a lot like billy holiday , especially in her latter days , and the choice of material on this album and dalton 's rendition of it are an experience only the lucky few have had the pleasure of hearing . i doubt she ever will be well known enough to gain broad popular appeal , especially at this late date , but at least we do n't have to search for the lp of this on ebay anymore . this album is a musical treasure . if you have never heard of karen dalton before , buy this and find out what you have missed . if you have heard of her , you do n't need any advice from me
