keep on shining the ozarks remain one of country rocks best kept secrets . although the new musical express here in the uk described them as 'one of the finest bands of the '70 's in any field ' they are not well known - but they should be . hailing from springfield , missouri the band are amongst the most eclectic in rock , almost every band member wrote material , sang and played an array of instruments . their harmonies certainly equalled the eagles , and their sound incompassed 'down at home ' bluegrass , fm rock , melodic folk country , but also more experimental arrangements such as 'colorado song ' on their debut release . 'it 'll shine ' is the ozarks second offering and it 's great to get it on cd . there was a trend for bands in the early 70 's to get back to the country , well the ozarks never really left it recording the material at a pre civil war farmhouse with glynn johns producing . there is a real joy on this disc , of a band in tune with nature and each other playing to their strengths . everyone will know larry lee 's 'jackie blue ' which was a big hit for the band and is good straight pop rock , but not entirely representative of the rest of the material , although 'look away ' and 'tidal wave ' show the band can rock . for me it 's the lighter and rootsy material that make it . 'you made it right ' with its southern gospel feel , 'lowlands ' with its magnificant harmonies and the slightly zany 'ee lawson ' typical of steve cash 's work . the disc closes with the title track leaving on a sentimental , and uplifting note . this disc is waiting to be discovered by any serious music fan - give it a try
