truly great album i love this album . thats all . anyway i can not stop listening to this cd . i listened to this only cd for four straight hours on a roadtrip . i still am not tired of this cd . theres still little lyrics i have missed . if someone reading this does not buy the cd , there is seriously something wrong with you . because its the best cd ever .
