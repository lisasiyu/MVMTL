can we have a remaster ? of course this is a fine collection . of course dizzy 's big band in the forties made some fantastic music . of course this is an indispensible part of jazz history . but oh , the sound ... previous issues of this music on both cd and vinyl far surpass this one in terms of sound quality . the dreaded nineties-era noise reduction technology is all over this music , taking great hunks of sonic elements away from these vital performances . since bluebird corrected similar problems by issuing the blanton/webster sides by duke ellington , should they not do the same for these great records
