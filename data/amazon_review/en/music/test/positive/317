jlp 's last really good disc 1977 's `` enigmatic ocean '' was indeed a tough act to follow , given the improvisational and sonic brilliance of one allan holdsworth on guitar . so , instead of trying to replicate that disc , ponty wisely leaned more in a rockier/funky direction for `` cosmic messenger '' , knowing that nobody could match holdsworth 's unique contributions or even get close . what results is a collection of songs that retain a lot of the characteristics of ponty 's earlier efforts but a bit leaner and meaner sounding . of the 2 guitarists , peter maunu definitely comes up the most distinct sounding with his soaring melodic bluesy rock sound . what i really enjoyed though was the huge punchy sounding rhythm section of drummer casey schurrel and bassist ralphe armstrong ( i especially loved ralphe 's huge thick growling fretless tone here , deeeeeelicious ! ) . allan zavod provides all the appropriately spacey textures with a bank of synths . have to admit though i would 've loved to hear more acoustic instruments as well to balance it out , as it was a bit synth/electronics heavy . as for the highlights , `` ethereal mood '' is beautifully hypnotic with not much more than acoustic violin , chiming acoustic guitars , fretless bass and tablas , very beautiful haunting melody . on the funkier/rocky side , `` art of happiness '' , `` do n't let the world pass you by '' and `` fake paradise '' come out swinging . the one low point for me is the ending tune `` egocentric molecules '' ( corny title btw ! ) , which sounds more like a mathematical exercise more than it does music . not one of ponty 's better compositional moments in this owl 's opinion . overall , a solid album worth having , but not groundbreaking by any stretch . after this , jlp would seem to just keep making the same record over and over again
