daz 's best album eva ! ! to everyone that was n't feelin daz on `` tha dogg pound gangsta lp '' ( including me ) -- this album has a completely different sound . the title is kinda lame , but it duz spell out what this album is all about . when daz left cali for the south , it seemed as if he finally sold out ... this could not be further from the truth . `` gangsta crunk '' is 100 timez more gangsta and on-point than anything that has come out of the west for the last few years . daz crushes the game and snoop with this release , even outdoing his classic debut , `` retaliation , revenge , and get back . '' do n't let the title fool you -- '' gangsta crunk '' does n't feature any dumbazz lil-jon type hooks , only bombazz beats & hardcore lyrics . the best cutz are `` i 'm looking for dat gangsta bit*h , '' `` a license to kill , '' `` we mean bizniz , '' and `` tow up from tha flo ' up '' -- the latter two both being classics . props to daz for turning his career around ; ca n't wait for the dogg pound reunion album
