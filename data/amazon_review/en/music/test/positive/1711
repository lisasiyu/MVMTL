vince gill ? all the reviews i have read of the ppl cd 's have had to do with the two leaders of the band , and while they are both great singer/songwriters . i think the real fun in listening to these songs is trying to spot that high , sweet , soft background vocal , and some of that shimmering guitar sound . it is none other than vince gill , you know , the artist to have won a grammy for every year in the decade of the 90 's , the man to have quietly lived out one of the most succseful music career 's in a long time . i just find a lot of enjoyment in imagining a young 19 year old vince gill finding his way in his new music career . he 's married to amy grant you know , huh & quot ; amie & quot ; ... amy . if that 's not fate i dont know what is . good songwriting , check it out
