great collection of early poco the forgotten trail is a great collection of early poco . the only major item missing from it is `` skatin ' '' , but you can get that on one of the group 's studio cds . as a person who 's been told to use music as a form of anger management , i have to say that i prefer the early country-rock poco to later pop crap like `` crazy love '' and `` call it love .
