5 star music ... but this ca n't be rudy 's best remastering overall , this remaster is very good . but i have a 1983 japanese lp issue of a night at birdland that blows rudy 's away . check out the alternate of `` wee dot '' on this cd -- for the love of clifford , art blakey 's cymbal rips our ear drums , and ruins clifford 's solo , which is actually the better solo of the two takes . you know something ? i question wrether this really is the great rudy 's remastering , especially when you consider this : when asked , in a 1986 interview on npr , what his regrets are , without hesitation he replied , `` not having the technology back then to accurately reproduce clifford brown 's trumpet sound '' ( wow , as great as clifford sounds on record , we will never really hear him ) . anyone with such love for clifford could not have done such lousy remastering on the `` wee-dot '' alternate ( i think producer michael cuscuna just puts rudy 's name on many of these ) . i do want to note , the absolutely essential `` once in a while , '' clifford 's greatest ballad next to `` ghost of a chance , '' sounds much better than on previous domestic issues , and alone is worth many times the price of these volumes . i think these rvg issues are little more than another of michael cuscuna 's re-marketing strategies . geeze , how many times does he expect us to buy these same titles ? but we do ! we get suckered in , thinking these will be the best-sounding yet -- just because they were remastered by rudy van gelder himself . how many issues , how many years , does it take to get it right ? for the japanese , it takes just once . they had it right as far back as 1985 , when they issued the prestige jazz masterpieces series -- gorgeous sound ! ( compare those 1985 cds , if you 're lucky enough to own any , to the currently available harsh and brittle sounding domestic ojc cds of the same sessions . ) japanese blue notes always sound magnificent -- perfect . very simply put , they are the best documentation of the masters on earth . i know the jazz cd market is nothing like the trillion dollar pop cd market ; blue note and mosaic are probably barely keeping above water . thus repackaging the same music every few years is probably necessary to keep the blue note catalog in existence ( remember the days , just before cds , when blue note lps were simply no longer available ... except from japan ? ) . and from reading cuscuna 's liner notes , i do believe he has a passion for this music . but remastering the domestic blue notes to , by design , make them sound inferior to , or at least very different from , the pristine japanese blue notes is taking marketing strategy too far . i have this strong suspicion that rudy did not actually remaster all of these in the rvg series . if you ask me , many of these rvgs are nothing more than previously shelved , unscheduled reissues and/or repackaged connoisseur series issues -- compare sometime to connoisseus you may already own and you 'll hear what i mean . all in all , there is some sort of racket going on between cuscuna and the japanese . think about it : why , after all these years , after all those issues -- blue note , connoisseur , ultimate , gold , 16-bit , rvg -- why do the japanese cds still sound superior ? ( by the way , they 're not always priced at $ 35 -- you now can find japanese blue notes as low as $ 14.29 . ) and , while i 'm at it , how many times have you purchased `` the complete , '' only to discover a new issue with additional material ? the answer to both those questions is simple : michael cuscuna knows what he 's doing . i 've not yet heard a japanese rvg , but i 'd bet if you compared one to a domestic rvg of the same title , you 'd like the japanese audio better . if i 'm right , that would prove , this rvg marketing ploy is a crock . what , rudy would master it differently for the japanese ? important note : if you buy any of these rvgs , be sure to grab the two volumes of thelonious monk . these include the 1951 , pre-rvg blue notes recorded by doug hawkins at wor studios on lacquer discs , not tape . in remastering these sessions , rudy applied a process by which the disc surface noise is now just about eliminated , and he brought out much detail and nuance -- these monk rvgs are really so incredible that previous issues are now simply obsolete . by the way , as the notes indicate , the sessions are complete , and `` four in one '' and its alternate take are included even though the tray card track sequence is all out of whack and does not show the alternate of `` four in one . '' get these -- ca n't emphasize it enough . on the other hand , on perfect takes , the sample cut from hank mobley 's soul station is in mono -- why ever would rudy remaster his originally stereo recording in mono ! ?
