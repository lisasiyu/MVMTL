a great understanding of tolkien 's world what an amazing album ! and who saw it coming ? jon anderson 's work here is the best , but there certainly is other great talent , especially on the last song . most of the lyrics are in elvish , but there 's some in english , too . the only real downpoint is the cover of `` battle of evermore '' pales in comparison to the original song . all in all , this accompanies tolkien 's work fabulously . one little weak spot keeps it from getting a 5
