`` where do we go from here ? there must be something near . '' i 'm going to review the 12 judas priest cds from 1974-1990 except the two live cds first . i am a huge priest fan . i first got into judas priest 20 years ago and have stayed loyal to them ever since . this may limit my objectivity since these reviews will really be comparing the different cds to one another not to other bands . there is no bad judas priest cd , only less consistent ones . judas priest is a band that have repeatedly experimented stylistically . some of these experiments were more successful than others . there are cds that are much heavier than others . i will try and bring all these factors into my reviews as well as attempting to summarize the general consensus among hardcore priest fans about each individual release . judas priest are possibly the most important act in metal history and they are certainly metal 's most unwavering proponents . they helped invent heavy metal music , helped refine and perfect it , helped popularize it and have remained `` defenders of the faith '' during metal 's darkest hours , while other `` metal '' acts ran for the hills . they are a legendary band whose role in popular music can not be overstated . if a metal band was not heavily influenced by judas priest directly , then they were heavily influenced by another band that was . their reach is inescapable . judas priest are led by rob halford , one of metal 's most recognizable icons and possibly the greatest vocalist the genre has ever known . halford 's unearthly delivery and range are as responsible as anything else for judas priest 's signature sound . judas priest were not the first band to employ the services of two lead guitarists but they were certainly the first to fully implement them . glenn tipton and k.k . downing are both phenomenal lead soloists but it 's their riffs and songwriting that have made judas priest one of the greatest guitar bands of all time . both are criminally underrated in the guitar world but downing is even underrated among priest fans . bassist ian hill rounds out the band . a founding member along with downing , hill is responsible for keeping the rhythm section humming along through priest 's many drummer changes . hill is not a flashy player but is certainly competent and on the rare occasions the band 's songwriting allows him to shine , he never disappoints . if this is the worst cd judas priest ever recorded with the first halford/tipton/downing/hill ( and it may be ) then that 's quite a compliment because this is a stellar debut . clearly , judas priest were still experimenting with their sound and trying to find their direction with this release . that being said , you can already hear the genesis of a fantastic songwriting collaboration which would make magic for the next three decades and counting . tipton and downing were already experimenting with integrating two guitars and their accompanying parts into a song . `` rocka rolla '' is probably their least heavy cd . it is also like many other judas priest cds in that it has it 's own fairly unique sound in their catalogue . overall , you will often find yourself asking whether this is truly a metal cd at all . in my opinion , this is the only judas priest cd that is true of . some of the best tracks off their second cd , `` sad wings of destiny '' were reportedly left off this cd and that , combined with the mediocre production quality , makes you wonder how truly great this could have been . track listing - `` one for the road '' - this slower-paced blues rocker starts off the album on a poor note . it certainly is n't a bad song . it 's just a little uninspired and it probably is the worst song offered here . it almost certainly was a poor choice to lead off the album . `` rocka rolla '' - right off the bat , track 2 on their debut album , this is probably one of judas priest 's all-time great songs . this is a fine , early example of a judas priest trademark , where each guitar and the bass are all playing their own riff . the magical combination of the galloping rhythm section , the sinister guitar lines and halford 's vocals really crystallizes here . there is perfectly placed harmonica at the close of the bridge section at the end of the guitar solo . this is a fantastic song , perhaps only slightly hampered by lukewarm lyrics . `` winter - deep freeze - winter retreat '' - i consider these three songs to actually be one continuous song and i consider `` cheater '' to be seperate altogether . if nothing else , these songs are connected thematically while not being bound by musical motif . `` winter '' starts things off well , immediately suggesting the chill of autumn 's demise with a grinding guitar sound effect and echoing , ethereal vocals by halford . pretty good . fairly heavy . this part comprises the bulk of the trilogy , both being longest in duration and carrying the most emotional impact . `` deep freeze '' is downing ( not tipton as another reviewer suggested ) playing some tremolo lines through distorted sound effects . downing himself has said he does n't like this but i do . it does what it 's supposed to , suggesting a chill so cold that words ca n't describe . it effectively makes the transition from `` winter '' to `` winter retreat '' . even if you do n't like it , it does n't last too long . admittedly , a lot of people seem to dislike it . `` winter retreat '' is a very light , short song . halford 's voice is literally beautiful here and the lyrics suggest the time for optimism has arrived . which of course is why it makes no real sense ( possible irony ? ) to connect this with ... `` cheater '' - great blues-metal riff opens this song about revenge against a woman who has done our narrator wrong ( and the guy she did it with too ... ) . perhaps the dark lyrical tone of this song would suggest to the observant the heavy musical days to come . a fantastic song overall with more strangely perfect harmonica work by halford and highlighted by a fantastic guitar solo . i ca n't be sure but i believe the solo is downing . glenn would go on to play too many of the solos later in the band 's career and this solo would appear to be evidence of that . tipton seems to be a technically superior player and certainly tends to play faster solos , highlighted by a lot of pentatonics , hammer-ons , pull-offs , and finger tapping . downing often plays a more soulful solo and he tends to use way more tremolo than tipton . of course , they 're at their best when they trade off and play off of one another , highlighting each other 's strengths . `` never satisfied '' - pretty good song featuring more phenomenal vocals by halford , especially the final wail . unfortunately , it 's a weak spot , both because of the fairly lame lyrics and because the main riff , already used too repetitively , sounds too similar to the bridge . al atkins removal from the band seems to have benefitted judas priest in two ways . halford sings circles around him and his removal as a lyricist had to have helped that area as well . `` run of the mill '' - clocking in at 8:33 , one of judas priest 's longest songs . one of their least metal . also , definitely one of the most interesting lyrically of their entire career . the song deals with a person who has failed to reach their potential and has become a failure . this is a great song with some very soulful guitar work . superlatives escape me to describe halford 's devastatingly poignant vocals . listen closely to hear a great bass line hiding under all that guitar . `` dying to meet you '' - schizophrenic song that starts off with a rare bass intro from ian hill and a slower pace overall . the song tells the story of a soldier preparing for battle and then entering combat . halford 's vocal range is put to the test here as he sings the first part of the song about as low and deep as you 'll ever hear him . about midway through the songs picks up speed , the guitars take center stage and halford 's vocal delivery gets much higher pitched . lyrically , this is the part of the song where the fighting starts . the tone of the song seems a little derisive of the soldier himself , perhaps topically reflecting many people 's attitudes about the vietnam conflict , which of course was winding down at the time . personally , i disagree with this view but judas priest are almost entirely an apolitical band for better or for worse so i can forgive these very trivial differences of opinion . `` caviar and meths '' - a two minute instrumental closes the cd out . i think it 's fantastic . wordlessly sad . it 's a tragedy that this was originally an eight minute long song with lyrics . i 'd love to hear the full version but it 's probably lost forever . i do n't consider `` diamonds and rust '' , priest 's cover of the joan baez masterpiece a song from this cd . i consider it a part of `` sin after sin '' , their third cd and will talk about it there . i believe the two versions of the song to be the same version with each being produced differently . amazon users consider this 10th out of 12 of judas priest 's 1974-1990 cds . i consider it dead last . that being said , it 's still a great album . it 's just not a great introduction to the band as a whole and a lot of fans of the heavier side of priest may not like this album . curious listeners should get `` screaming for vengeance '' . it 's not priest 's best but it 's their best selling and possibly their most generally accessible and most indicative of what priest generally sound like
