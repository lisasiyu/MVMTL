wonderful spiritual music from colombia like many colombians , i 've known about carlos vives from his days of clasicos de la provincia in 1993 . vives takes provincial music from colombia ( vallenato and cumbia , among numerous others ) and infuses them with a spirituality and depth that makes the music all the more worthy . el amore de mi tierra is no different . vives pulls from various fountains of colombian music and turns them into flowing , rhythmic world music that is accessable to all peoples . the collection here is very good . while & quot ; fruta fresca & quot ; is the track that most people are familiar with , & quot ; la piragua & quot ; is definately the best track on the album . an update of a classic colombian cumbia song , vives 's take on & quot ; la piragua & quot ; turns the song into a lush fable full of earthy melodies and a spirit of the amazon without forskaing the song 's musical roots . for those who are new to carlos vives , this album is a great place to start
