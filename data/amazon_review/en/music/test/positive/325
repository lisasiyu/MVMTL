stevie 's double crowning achievement ! i 'm one of those reviewers that rarely rates music that has n't touched me in one way or another . so when i felt that i wanted to write a review for a stevie wonder album , i ended up struggling over which of his great releases i should review . i love all of his mid-seventies releases ... .most notably , `` innervisions '' , `` fullfillingness ... '' , and , of course , `` songs ... '' . i guess i finally decided to 'tackle ' this one based on its historical significance to the art of music . for one , stevie was `` coming into his own '' as far as musical expression and social commentary within his songs . other than the great bob marley and marvin gaye , stevie was at the forefront of writing about the joys , pains , positives and negatives of human exsistance on earth ... and he did it very well . songs such as `` village ghetto land '' , `` pastime paradise '' , `` saturn '' and `` have a talk with god '' among others , were as powerful 'messages ' one could experience through a set of speakers . secondly , he was able to finally gain total control of his musical vision from motown and berry gordy ... .even more so than marvin had done with `` whats going on '' ... and this total control shows most prevelant on `` songs '' than any previous release leading up to this one ( imo ) . there 's certainly a little bit of everything on `` songs '' -- -- the joy of life on `` is n't she lovely '' ; black man 's contributions to evolution in `` black man '' ; world love and peace in `` i am singing '' ; the joys and pains of childhood in `` i wish '' ; spiritual guidance in `` have a talk with god '' ; desperation in the world 's ghettos in `` village ghetto land '' , and even some `` props '' to mr. ellington in `` sir duke '' . one could literally go on like this for every song on this double album ... .yes , very moving , significant statements indeed ! as for the actual music and musicians , they are `` all over the board '' here ( and stevie certainly plays his share of the instruments , however , not as exstinsively as past albums ) . every musician involved in `` songs '' played exactly what each track called for , and , at the same time , still managed to put their 'mark ' on these great cuts . the listener will be happy to find mellow , introspective songs ... upbeat , funky rockers ... spanish-tinged music ... .and even stevie 's brand of fushion ( contusion ) ... overall , a wonderful assortment of musical styles and genres mixed into one of the most important double lps ever released . as a closing note , i am somewhat of a new-comer to this great artist , and yes , i am white . however , i feel this is one of a handful of artists that crosses/bridges all ethnic groups ... weather black , white , yellow , or red . please do n't let the color of your skin ( or stevie 's ) stop you from experiencing some of the most important 'art ' ever produced . strongly recommended , along with any other releases from this genius
