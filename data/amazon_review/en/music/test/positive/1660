like the record company says : this cd is raw & electric - and one of my all time favorites . i agree with one reviewer who said that he keeps trying to find another r.l . cd with this much energy , but ca n't . i doubt we ever will . if you like the `` quieter '' , more traditional style of `` too bad jim '' , you may not find this to your taste . but for raw power and emotion , you wo n't find anything else like it . i think that 's why i 've played it so much over the past 5 years - it 's just different . first you get lulled by `` over the hill '' and then crashed into with `` alice mae '' . also , check out the often overlooked gem on this collection - `` tribute to fred '' . the range on this cd is about as big as the style allows . you 'll reach for this whenever you do n't want to hear the same old sounds
