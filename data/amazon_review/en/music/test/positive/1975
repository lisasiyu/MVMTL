controversial and classic ! ! ! ! ! wow ! after reading the reviews on amazon for this cd , i can tell that above anything else , natalie cole stirs a lot of emotion in her audience . it 's a rare quality that inspires others to speak out the way everyone has on this controversial cd ! from that hot wailing vocal in the opening song `` criminal '' to the searing gospel version of `` if i ever lose my faith in you '' , this collection is a winner ! ! ! natalie has tackled various genres and made them her definitive version of each song . she is funky in `` old man '' , soulful in `` day dreaming '' , and haunting in `` the man with the child in his eyes '' . i ca n't help but feel that these song writers would not only give her a nod , but the grammy award as well ! you can count me in when natalie comes to town in concert . i ca n't wait to see her perform these songs and more ! thank you natalie ! i ca n't say that you 're `` back '' , because you simply never went away
