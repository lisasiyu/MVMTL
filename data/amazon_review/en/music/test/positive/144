pure form of art i 've been a fan of the cardigans ever since their first cd release in usa and when i 've heard that some band members were doing solo i was very anxious to hear them . i think that nina 's cd is art in its purest form . each song is carefully put together like a collage to form a trully unique piece . i found my self experiencing different moods as i listened to each of the songs . some other very good songs were actually not released on this cd . songs such as & quot ; charlie charle & quot ; , & quot ; my misery is my mystery & quot ; , and & quot ; what the hell are you crying for ? & quot ; but dont worry you can still hear these songs . for those of you who do n't know nina has a special website for her cd its : http : //www.acamp.cjb.net/ . there she has an option of listening the unreleased songs . i hope this review has helped you in some way
