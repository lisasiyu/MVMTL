all the sixties classics this compilation covers the period 1964 to 1971 - the stuff that really matters . the same label has released a double cd compilation tit1led ultimate collection , which covers their later music as well . if you want their later hits , including come dancing , that is the collection you should go for . this contains all the classic sixties songs including you really got me , all day and all of the night , tired of waiting for you , dedicated follower of fashion , well respected man , sunny afternoon , waterloo sunset , autumn almanac , days , lola and apeman . it also includes dave 's two solo uk hits - death of a clown and susannah 's still alive . the set is presented in chronological order beginning with their cover of long tall sally , a song that demonstrates their musical roots in r+b . they did n't stick to r+b for very long , becoming more of a mainstream pop group and continually changing their style thereafter . nevertheless , their songs were always distinctive because of ray 's talent for making ordinary situations into extraordinary songs . my favorite kinks song is waterloo sunset , a huge uk hit but not an american hit . it is about romance at a railway station that i am familiar with , though i can not possibly imagine what inspired ray to write that song , but he was a genius . the best tribute to the quality of their songs lies in the diversity of the covers that have been recorded by singers in several genres of music . kirsty maccoll ( days ) , the stranglers ( all day and all of the night ) , petula clark ( days - and a french version of well respected man ) , cathy dennis ( waterloo sunset , sunny afternoon ) , green day ( tired of waiting for you ) , jimmy buffett ( sunny afternoon ) , van halen ( you really got me ) and barb jungr ( waterloo sunset ) are among those who have covered kinks songs . despite the brilliance of some of the covers , here you get the chance to hear the original versions . if you just want a single cd of their sixties music , this one is as good as any you will find
