all you have to do is dream ... for all the fans of the original broadway musical soundtrack of `` dreamgirls , '' their dreams have come true with this 25th-year anniversary special edition cd . included are all the original tracks from the dreamgirls soundtrack and three previously unreleased recordings of `` driving down the strip '' `` it 's all over '' and a reprise of the title track `` dreamgirls '' for the finale . a second cd has instrumental versions of some of the stand out tracks including `` and i am telling you i 'm not going '' and `` one night only . '' the album has been remastered and it does sound louder with more bass than the original , but there are some instances where jennifer holliday 's voice begins to blare . that 's probably due to the fact that holliday is such a powerful singer and the decibel levels went into the red when they were recording the original master tapes , so it ca n't be helped . however , the added tracks sound very crisp and clear . also included in this special edition cd is a booklet containing an intro by henry krieger ( song writer for additional music in the motion picture dreamgirls ) , the original liner notes with photos from the stage production , and lyrics to all the songs . i would have given this set five stars but the song `` heavy '' is n't on here , neither is the disco version of `` one night only . '' from what i understand , we 're lucky to get the three previously unreleased tracks ! legend has it that geffen did not want to produce a double length album with three virtually unknown singers , which explains the omission of some songs and the remixing of two different versions of `` one night only '' down to one track . also , he wanted the best possible sound quality for the original album . the inlcusion of `` it 's all over '' is well worth the price of this cd . the climactic show-down between the three girls , the replacement , and the boss brings a new perspective to the show stopping song `` and i 'm telling you ... '' one more thing , there seems to be some confusion between this cd and the one coming out for the motion picture `` dreamgirls . '' this is the original broadway recording of the musical . beyonce and jenifer hudson are not on this cd . but jennifer holliday , sheryl lee ralph and loretta devine shine as the original dreams
