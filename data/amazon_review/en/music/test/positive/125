like wow man when i think of greg dulli , i think , why is n't this guy in more cigarette commercials ? also people have told me that i look like him , so i always want to check out with my doppelganger is up to . in the 1990s , greg dulli carried the weight called the afghan whigs and challenged everyone 's attention largely on the force of his personality . that is so me . outside of kurt cobain , dulli is the only real charmer from ten years ago . his music was honest and cool and had r & amp ; b and motown sophistication . dulli now peeps his head over the fence with blackberry belle . dulli pissed his territory with songs about love and suicide in a style of a smooth operator . his voice is more confident than ever . his new outfit seems more musical than the afghan whigs which were limited to their usual rock and rock paths . this is like when nick cave left the birthday party to do much more stylish music on a bigger scope . i think barry adamson and kid congo are available for employment . i look forward to more records and shows
