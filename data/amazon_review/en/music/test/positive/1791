music is great , recording is poor ... all the recording quality complaints from others are true . this cd plays ok with $ 30 boombox , but not on a serious hi-fi . but the music is really better than i thought . i was thinking french guys are good at love songs , which is absolutely true , but their marching music is even better than the german ones i just got ( from the same company called legacy international ) . how bad is the recording ? it seems like the music was played from lp , taped in a dark room , stored for 5 years , and then dumped on cd ... how good is the music ? i still rate it 4 star even for the 0 stat recording
