best metal band to come along in a while ... they 're sort of a throwback : speed metal combined with elements of 70 's metal , and combine to make a killer sound . i saw these guys live , they 're even better in person than on the album . they have a very tight , defined sound that chugs along until you head moves in unison , they have a lot of variety in their riffs ( although it 's still essentially speed metal , so they do n't go too crazy with variety ) with head pounding vocals . when you play this , turn up the volume , you wo n't be sorry . my best attempt at a comparison would be this : combine metallica 's `` ride the lightning '' with sabbath 's `` master of reality '' and throw in a little zeppelin , and that 's about what you 'll get with the sword . a great up and coming metal band . i ca n't stop playing this album .
