hellogoodbye scores with debut cd hellogoodbye has recently become one of my favorite new bands . they have a unique emo sound , with a touch of techno . the best tracks on their debut `` zombies ! aliens ! vampires ! dinosaurs ! `` , in my opinion are their first single `` here ( in your arms ) '' , `` baby , it 's fact '' , `` touchdown turnaround ( do n't give up on me ) `` , and `` all of your love '' . their lyrics are just plain catchy , and their songs vary throughout the album . some are loud , and some are soft love songs . out of all the songs on the album , i can totally see touchdown turnaround as their next single . it 's a great song , with really fun lyrics . if your a fan of bright eyes , you 'll like this band . for some reason , they remind me of them in some songs . it 's a fun cd that can be played over and over again .
