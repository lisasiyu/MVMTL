a must have for your jazz collection ... ... this one . the definitive first half of the basie & quot ; old testament band & quot ; studio catalogue . good-quality sound , for the era , as well as excellent remastering of the source material . these versions of these songs are what took basie from a mid-western regional band status to national prominence . better material than the 3 discs extant comprising most of the second half of the & quot ; old testament & quot ; studio catalogue ( & quot ; essential & quot ; series , v.1-3 from columbia records ) , as well ( if one must choose ) . i give this one 6 stars from a strictly swing-era only perspective
