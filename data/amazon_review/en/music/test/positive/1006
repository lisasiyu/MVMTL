loud glam-rock music of the seventies with a style that mixed lightweight , teenybopper music with heavy metal ( a strange mix , indeed ) , sweet ultimately ended up falling between the two , not pleasing anybody from either camp . before that , they scored a string of uk hits including a number one ( blockbuster ) and five number twos ( co-co , hell raiser , ballroom blitz , teenage rampage , fox on the run ) . note that fox on the run is an original song , not a cover of manfred mann 's song . little willy and wig-wam-bam both made number four in the uk . their last major hit , love is like oxygen , made the top ten in britain and america - it actually did slightly better in america than britain . all seventeen of the sweet 's uk hits ( including the minor hits ) are here together with three album tracks that illustrate what sweet wanted to do with their music . having had their career controlled others ( the production team of chinn and chapman ) , they cut loose on titles such as restless and set me free . this is the definitive sweet hits compilation . if you enjoy british glam-rock of the early seventies with a hard edge , you are likely to enjoy sweet 's music
