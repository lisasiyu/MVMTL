this band was so far ahead of it 's time . . . that you will discover them very soon - buy this disc ! seriously , i had vinyl of both of these releases in college and as cd 's took over replaced my vinyl with this . it 's pure psychedelic power pop done right , combining sing along hook happy elements of the beatles , ethereal layered guitar work with background electronics that really put it `` out there '' . front man mitch easter of course played a hand in putting rem at the forefront of college radio and it 's unfortunate that his excellent work with let 's active never really made it into the mainstream consciousness . those who have heard it know . buy this , love it , and then move on to big plans for everybody
