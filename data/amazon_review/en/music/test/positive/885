modern day blues classic this is one of the finest blues albums to be produced in the past 25 years . right off the bat from the blistering 'testify ' to the classic 'mary had a little lamb ' to the closing jazz influenced 'lenny ' you know this album is going to be something special . srv & td are found here as a trio and you would be hard pressed to find a tighter band . this album is a little more striped down and more bluesy then srv latter works . this and 'in sessions ' with albert king are probably stevie 's best blues albums
