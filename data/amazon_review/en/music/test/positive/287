welcome , but uneven , comeback it is difficult to rate and review 'time out of mind , ' bob dylan 's start to a string of late renaissance achievements . the album , which is named after mercutio 's line before romeo crashes the capulets ' masquerade ball in 'romeo and juliet , 'finds dylan `` love sick '' with a world that has gone wrong and left him bewildered . these subject matters are deftly taken up with the blues with his excellent new band and daniel lanois at the producer helm and jack frost just in the wings . the highlights are hallmark . even though his voice has aged and is more gravelly , it does appropriately remind one of leon redbone , which suits his new endeavors well . `` love sick '' is thick and bottom-line . with some hefty guitar chords he sings his heart out . then , he comes up with `` dirt road blues , '' arguably the c.d . 's best song . with what can be described as rockabilly blues , he and his band transport us to the texas border for some hot chili . `` starting in the doorway '' reminds us of his vintage work . sometimes this number gets as langorous , however , like the `` ... summer night ... '' he walks through . similarly , `` million miles '' is good blues , even if the title tells us much about the length of the destination . `` trying to get to heaven '' and the beautifully shimmering `` not dark yet , '' really hit the spot with two of his top songs here . also worthy of his latter legacy is the celebrated ballad , `` make you feel my love , '' which is as eloquent and substantial as his best love songs . also good quality can be found with the heavy `` cold irons bound '' . this song lingers a bit too long , but especially the closer , `` highlands , '' does n't come close to reaching the destination and is n't close to climbing to the heights of a classic like `` sad eyed lady of the lowlands '' . 'time out of mind ' was able to capture enough attention by landing dylan on the cover of 'newsweek ' magazine . he deserved it anyway , but this album is a mixed comeback , providing some disapointment despite the hype . in spots he delivers his old genius in a different venue , but 'oh , mercy , ' before it , and 'modern times , ' after it demonstrate that there are a lot of dylan classics to be found more worthy than 'time out of mind '
