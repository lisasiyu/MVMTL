an 'emotion ' that rings true following her deserved breakthrough with her last album evolution , martina mcbride continues her flirtation with the pop side of country with emotion , in which she delves further into her own brand of immaculately produced country ( pop ) , resulting in her least country album to date . fortunately , not only does mcbride have the voice to pull it off with ease , but the continuing transition she 's made over her last couple of albums towards pop is achieved seamlessly ( and not with the jarring , heavy-handed feel of faith hill 's inferior and overblown breathe ) . again , one of mcbride 's key strengths is her choice of material , which always manages to balance fun , somewhat lightweight tunes ( 'i love you ' ) with strong , well-written material ( 'love 's the only house ' , 'this uncivil war ' ) . as is typical , her vocal work is first-rate , particularly on the sterling ballad 'there you are ' , which she manages to salvage from being just another typical rumination on the wages of love . faith and shania should pay better attention -- this is how first-rate pop is supposed to sound
