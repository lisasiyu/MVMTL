the start of something good this is trisha yearwood 's self titled debut album . the album was produced by garth fundis , who she has worked with many times . there 's a collaboration with garth brooks , top songwriters , what more do you need ? yearwood is one of my favorite female country singers , because she sings better than most of her peers . her voice is very good at emoting , she can go from a whisper to a scream in a second flat . she really makes you feel what she is singing . there was some big hits from this album including the classic & quot ; she 's in love with the boy & quot ; , the ballad & quot ; the woman before me & quot ; , the uptempo & quot ; that 's what i like about you & quot ; and the ballad with garth brooks singing backup titled & quot ; like we never had a broken heart & quot ; . other highlights include & quot ; the whisper of your heart & quot ; , & quot ; fools like me & quot ; and & quot ; victim of the game & quot ; . overall a strong debut
