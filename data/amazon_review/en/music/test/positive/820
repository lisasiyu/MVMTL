deffinately a good start for the radio . this is the guitarist from jonah 's ( yeah , yeah , yeah ; jonah 's this , jonah 's that ) former band far . this is a really good footing for the radio in it 's current state . i have a question though : when the heck is that quicksand tribute album supposed to come out ? ! k ; bug the heck out of this band if you ever see them and ask them about the quicksand tribute album that was supposed to come out like 5 years ago ( it was also supposed to have ray cappo from youth of today and shelter , chaka malik from burn and orange 9mm , glassjaw , biohazard and a bunch of other incredibly talented people ) . ta ta
