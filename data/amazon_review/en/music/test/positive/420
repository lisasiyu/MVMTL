wonderful album needs remastering ! ! `` the best of george harrison '' is a wonderful compilation of his best beatles and post-beatles hits and songs , but i find myself agreeing with other reviewers on the choice of beatle songs . `` if i needed someone '' and `` think for yourself '' could have been replaced with `` all things must pass '' and `` is n't it a pity '' which deserves to be here even more since the `` my sweet lord '' 45 was a double sided hit with that track . this would have also tipped the scale more toward george 's solo sides , to make a more even handed comp . also , this cd has been out forever , it not only needs to be recompiled , but remastered ! ! it pales beside the remasters of the original albums . but if you can not buy the individual albums , `` the best of george harrison '' is a decent pick for someone wanting to check out his music for the first time
