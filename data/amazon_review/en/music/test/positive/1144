a national treasure it is not an overstatement to write that `` gershwin plays gershwin : the piano rolls '' contains some of the most beautiful music ever recorded . gershwin 's virtuosity as a pianist is spellbinding . while his compositional abilities are well appreciated , who knew he was so good on the keys ? the listener will be swept away by this recording 's sweet melodies , tender craftsmanship and sensational speed . one might expect gershwin 's songs to sound thin and bare without an orchestra , but given the man on the piano , they sound surprisingly rich and full . not a stripped down version of the real thing , gershwin on solo piano is a means to an end , a different way to appreciate his music . indeed , while gershwin 's orchestral music may sound a bit dated , his solo piano work has a timeless quality . inexplicably , george gershwin 's solo piano music has languished under the radar . while this may be true for most listeners , there 's nothing keeping you from enjoying `` gershwin plays gershwin .
