enough of this broadway vs london stuff . let 's add australia to the picture like most people , i 've been torn between london and broadway for a while . i 'll admit , i 'm fond of both london and broadway , but some songs i like on broadway more than london , and vice versa . however , when i bought the australian recording , it turned into my favorite cats recording , hands down . they have every song in there , ( growltiger 's last stand , and battle of the pekes and pollicles ) anyhow , here 's my biased opinion on which of the three recordings dominate in certain songs . overture - the overture is pretty much the same jellicle song for jellicle cats - london naming of cats - australia invitation to the jellicle ball - broadway old gumbie cat - london but australia 's is pretty darn good rum tum tugger - i 'm not very fond of london 's version or broadway 's . i 'd have to say australia , but broadway is just as good . grizabella - london bustopher jones - london mungojerrie and rumpleteazer - australia . this version has a very interesting mungo and rumpel old deuteronomy - london or broadway jellicle ball - london grizabella : the glamour cat - tie memory - okay , elaine paige is about as good as it gets . but debbie byrne from australia delivers a heart felt memory also . gus : the theatre cat - australia growltiger 's last stand/the ballad of billy mccaw - all are good macavity : the mystery cat - australia mr. mistoffelees - australia . the australian rum tum tugger is a lot better . and while i 'm a huge sarah brightman fan , and you can hear her overpowering in this song , i still say australia wins here . memory - moment of truth . i love elaine paige . her memory is as good as it gets . however , some would say that elaine 's version is too soft and sweet , and is n't bitter and cold enough . this song could go both ways . betty buckley certainly expressed rage and power in this song , but maybe too much . in my personal opinon , elaine 's version is too soft , and buckley 's version is too cold . debbie byrne is a perfect medium , and she expresses remorse , sorrow , pain , anger , and loneliness in perfect harmony . i 'd have to say australia . journey to the heaviside layer - not much of a difference . tie between all three . ad-dressing of cats - broadway . thank god for ken page
