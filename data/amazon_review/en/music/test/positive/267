omarion 's review omg when i heard he was comin got with an album after the whole b2k break-up , i was surprised as hell ! . i brought it and love every single song except for `` never gon na let you go '' i dont like that song really . i love the album coming from a true b2k fan i thought it was gon na be like the same ol ' b2k stuff but with 1 person but i was really surprised . he really matured on this album and i love it . love you o
