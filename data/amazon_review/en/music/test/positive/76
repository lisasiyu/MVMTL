stands the test of time i do n't write reviews ; my opinion is my own and it only matters to those who love me . still ... '' amos lee '' stands the test of time . how long ago did i buy this cd ? i played it to death when i got it . had to go see amos when he came to town . talked my sister into going with me . `` you 'll like him , he 's low key , kind of jazzy-bluesy-folk music . '' recently popped the cd back into the cd player . it 's still soooo good for relaxing , slowing down , chillin ' . my daughter surprised me when the music started . she said , `` is this amos lee ? ! ! i love this cd . '' and she 's a 13 year old ( self-described ) orchestra nerd who loves modern hard rock : emo . if you have n't gotten this one yet , but you 've been thinking about it , stop waiting . it 's intellingent , sophisticated , difficult to classify , and wo n't get old
