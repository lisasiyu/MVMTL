stick to r & b ! tyreese will always get 5 stars from me when it comes to singing . however , the last thing we need is another rapper out there rapping about the same thing . tyreese has a sexy , sensual , and pleasant singing voice that 's very pleasing to the ears , but with the rapping it just sounds like he 's trying too hard to prove that he can rap . then again , this review may be a little biased because i 'm not used to that side of tyreese . i just do n't see him in that light , as a lyricist instead of a vocalist . i 'm sorry , tyreese will always be a singer/actor and not a rapper to me . i think that 's why he made it a double disc set because he knew that everyone would just buy the r & b disc , but nobody would buy the rap disc
