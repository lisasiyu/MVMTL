good music however the title is technically false . there is some good music on the two discs . the first one collects most of paul and wings hit singles whilst the second are some personal selections from paul , where some gems can be found such as `` too many people '' , `` tomorrow '' , `` daytime nightime suffering '' and `` maybe i 'm amazed '' . some of the material on the second disc is a little slight and there are many better songs that could have been selected . the main issue is that these songs are not all technically paul mccartney and wings , alot of them are paul and linda , paul on his own , is its not a true representation of strictly wings , currently wings greatest is just that . having said that you ca n't go wrong with the great catchy pop rock on this album . it is good to see wings get more coverage , beneath the beatles they really are getting some respect for the great band they were
