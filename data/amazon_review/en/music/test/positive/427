macabre jazz at its finest its difficult to determine where to begin when describing `` submariner '' . this is one of the most richly layered albums i have ever heard , not only that , but there are only three members to the dead science . to start off , the brothers bischoff and vocalists mickens started off as a arty jazz ensemble hitting the clubs in the seattle area . its clear that that jazz background permeates the album but putting your finger on who to compare this style of jazz to is very challenging . when one thinks modern day jazz influenced musical acts with dark overtones , a wide variety of artists that may range from portishead to nostalgia 77 , maybe even soul coughing may come to mind . whats amazing is that each one of these bands/artists have left traces of their jazz lineage dna , and yet they sound nothing alike . the same is the case of the dead science 's submariner . this album stands apart though by being surprisingly organic . no scratches , no samples ( not to say there 's anything wrong with those , but ) this is an album that relies on its craftsmanship . let 's take track # 7 for example . the song is called threnody , which literally means song of lament , sometimes used in funerals . this threnody called threnody would be the best ambassador to submariner as there is a collective of seemingly sporatic jazz improve . upon closer listening though , one would be able to glean that this is as simultaneously horrifying and beautiful as a giger metamorphasis . there is no conflict of musical elements as a double bass vamping is followed by flat rapid precussion artistry , which is needle-and-threaded with lyrics like `` corpses buried on the banks of the mississippi river '' and `` cell wall divisions corroding under falsities '' . `` below '' , `` white cane '' , and `` the ghost integrity '' are also very strong points to this album , although every song works well together as a well oiled submarsable .
