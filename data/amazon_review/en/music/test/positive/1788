bonus dvd worth price alone some great reworkings of old classics , some obscure tracks made easier to obtain , and a bonus dvd documentary containing interviews with dylan carlson and european live footage . for the cost , a really great deal . if you 're not familiar with earth 's music , this might be a good starting place , if only to hear dylan carlson speak of his influences and motives behind curating such a band as this . if you 're already a fan , you wo n't be disappointed . the packaging is a bit generic , simple jewel case style with minimal text in booklet similar to many other earth releases , but the music really shines as always .
