killer songwriting ! this has got to be one of my favorite new albums out right now . i bought this a few weeks ago in nyc mostly based on the reviews comparing feeder to coldplay . the comparison isi n't entirely accurate . but right now it seems everyone coming out who 's british is being compared to coldplay . feeder still sounds like feeder but they 've expanded their music as well as their lyrics . one of the best tracks is track # 3 . it has dougie payne and fran healy of travis doing background vocals . it 's simply awesome . if you want a great record to hold you over until the new coldplay and travis , then get this . but please , everybody stop comparing everyone to coldplay ! give these guys their own credit
