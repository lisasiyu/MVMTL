bigger than the hit parade listening to an album like this makes you despise the record industry and the way that fashions and slavish conformity dictate success . the buffalo skinners was released in 1993 , two years after big country had been callously and stupidly dropped by phonogram . they then produced this astounding masterpiece , in which every track is solid and some `` pink marshmallow moon , '' `` alone , '' etc . - are sheer classics . of course , gurning teenagers with grungey guitars were all the rage at the time , so the craftsmanship and quality of this earnest and soulfull collection of songs went largely unrecognised . big country created a sound that could fill not only stadiums and arenas but also the vast landscapes of their native and their adopted land .
