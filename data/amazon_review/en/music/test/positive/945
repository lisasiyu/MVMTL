bach , moog , and carlos there 's very little enjoyable as seeing the brandenburg 's put on by a live group of musicians . switched-on is the antithesis of that experience : a work completed in the studio with extensive dubbing . yet , hearing this again , after so many years , is a reminder of bob moog 's analog synthesizer and wendy carlos ' comprehensive application . carlos did not show how to compose for the synthesizer , the way stockhausen and subotnick had . this was exclusively a study in tone-shaping and arranging for synthesizer . bach , an organ master , would have been the first person to test-drive moog 's creations had he been alive . analog synths sound more organic than digital ones , and moog 's are distinctive even in that category . [ if you are looking for carlos ' interpretation of beethoven 's 9th , for a clockwork orange , that music is unfortunately not included in this set .
