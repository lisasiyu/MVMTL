nuno 's guitar work is very impressive this album beats out a more negative vibe than any of extremes others , but that does n't mean that its not enjoyable . the real attraction towards the sound of this album is in the guitar work of nuno bettencourt . the intricate rhythms of the guitar solos , made possible by nuno 's shredding abilities , are magic . in some ways i feel his sound bluesy , with an influence of hendrix . i would n't recommend this to someone who it buying their first extreme album , a more rewarding buy would be the best of extreme : an accidental collication of atoms . i would recommend it to someone looking to expand their extreme collection however . particularly impressive songs are midnight express , where nuno shows off his incredible speed on a steel string acoustic , and hip today , the guitar solo of which still blows my mind . also worth mentioning is cynical f*** , which is n't as technically impressive but an enjoyable hard rocking song none the less
