oud great ! by chance , i saw the trio perform at the monterey world music festival in 2002 . the music starts out fairly slow , almost boring . after a few songs , the pulse of the one drum , the melody of the oud and clarinet really started to be hypnotic . at the end of the set the crowd gave the trio a standing ovation . i bought the cd and played it for a friend who thinks it is great 'massage ' music . it is very soothing , relaxing , mysterious music that calms the mind
