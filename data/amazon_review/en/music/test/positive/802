definitely a must have , man ! ! ! ! ! look here , i knew that there was more to this band than express yourself . this cd more than satisfied that . everything on here bumps . i can do without the slow stuff , but overall , mr. wright and company did they thang ! ! ! ! ! uhhhhh ! ! ! ! i love charles ' voice ; especially on your love ( means everything to me ) . that stands out because it sounds like his voice was all shot and he still found something in it to deliver . if you like true blue funkiness , then get this . it is cats and bands like this that never get played on the radio , which sucks , that really bring that sausage gravy vibe . you will understand that latter once you cop this or download it
