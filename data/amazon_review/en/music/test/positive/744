a great and beautiful musical ! i very very highly recommend this musical . it is such a sweet love story , with wonderful songs . sadly not many people know about the musical `` carnival , '' based on the film , `` lili . '' it is definitly a gem . the song that especially touched me , was the hauntingly beautiful , `` her face . '' it 's such a romantic musical with unforgetable cute songs and romantic ones as well
