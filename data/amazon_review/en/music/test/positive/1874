best cd ever borrowed i had heard of unearth before as one of the best hardcore/metal bands around . when i had the opprotunity to borrow their album stings of conscience from a good friend , i immediately took the initiative . i had been hearing this album while in my homies ' ride , and i was hooked after the second song ( one step away ) when i heard that insane guitar . then the crazy drums , and the screaming , and everything else it was pure mayhem . this has to be my new favorite band . i ca n't wait to see them live . this is the best free cd i had ever recieved . i recommend that you go out and buy this album to support this great band . i plan to buy more albums from them too . \\m/
