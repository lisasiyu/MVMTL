weird , funny , dark , strangely funky - tom waits strikes again i 've barely even scratched the surface of tom waits ' music , but from the three albums of his i 've been lucky enough to hear , i know that the man is truly an original in the musical world . there is some dylan , some beefheart , some nick cave in there - but not really , because tom waits can never be mistaken for anybody else . he 's a primitivist in the truest sense of the word - his musical and lyrical voice evokes an ancient wisdom with its jarring and primal diametrical phrases that cut straight to the bone . when we hear `` earth died screaming , '' we know that waits is serious , and his vision of the apocalypse is drenched in the biblical imagery of sickness and decay . fellow dark prince nick cave may know the lingo , but ultimately he is an historian who can cleverly reference ancient literature and religion , whereas tom waits has the voice of an ancient prophet . that may explain why his status as a pop-culture icon is sort of a `` hobo guru . '' there 's something genuinely mystical about him . `` bone machine , '' tom waits ' blisteringly weird little epic of clangs , twangs , and grumbles , was a powerful way for the master to enter his third decade of recording . some of it seems a bit disorganized , and some of the songs are out of place being on this album ( and those are kind of a part of what makes tom waits ' albums so cool ) , but there 's no such thing as a throwaway here . the melodies are strong , the lyrics are fantastic , the themes are steady and powerful , and the presentation is truly unique ; the grotesque , sometimes bone-chilling percussive clangs of waits 'bones ' players are sounds that have rarely been heard before on a rock record . it 's an aggressively experimental approach that manages to avoid sounding elitist at all - in fact , i 'd say that in a totally whacked way , this is kind of accessible . who can say that `` murder in the red barn '' is n't catchy ? it 's a great little story-song with a chaucerian barnyard allegory of man 's violent nature , cycling around and around the `` murder in the red barn '' chorus with the bones bong-bonging away and sharp twangs of the steel-stringed guitar . `` i do n't wan na grow up '' is avant-garde balladry , if there is such a thing - there 's a static scratch in the background and waits growls more painfully than ever , but he strums the chords and delivers his cry of fear against the wickedness of adulthood in such a heartfelt way that it 's become the most popular song on the album . it 's the same twisted logic that makes this such a fun listen . it 's diverse , brave , gruesomely funny , strange , and unforgettable . `` earth died screaming , '' `` dirt in the ground , '' `` black wings , '' `` goin out west , '' `` in the colosseum , '' and `` such a scream '' are other standout tracks .
