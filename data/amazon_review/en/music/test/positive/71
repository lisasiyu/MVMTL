one of the best this era of tangerine dream ( td ) was just great . the virgin years were truly a great period for td . for me it deals with space and landscape . it 's so close to repetitive music that would come much later . it 's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies . you could fly with them and end up with more in the end . you ca n't say that for too many of these electronic groups . after that period they would go on with this ambient music that was n't up to the same standards . it seems they are back ( with other musicians of course ) with the same kind of concept . great ! they were an important link on the electronic scene . a great album ! a great period
