4,5 stars - only a tiny bit worse than new jersey bon jovi is a band that may not be the best one ( the best one 's were led zeppelin , rolling stones or pink floyd ) , but their record-sales say otherwise . there is perhaps a grain of truth in the notion that half of their audience were teenagers and women and their sucess was soemwhat overrated , as well as that they went big on jon bon jovi 's coiffeur and outlook , though . nonetheless , i think they truly deserved their overwhealming breakthrough from the 80 's offering people catchy , competent and well-ctrafted pop-rock-metal tunes played on and on by the mtv . all in all , that 's how metal sounded in the mid-80 's ( just take whitesnake or def leppard ) . personally , i have always been an advocate of this band , turning a blind eye on what other narrow-minded people kept saying about it . yes , bon jovi has made couple of cheesy songs ( `` always '' ) and some both cheesy and too commercial as well ( `` it 's my life '' ) . `` it 's my life '' was a cheap trial to break to the pop-charts , but , if there are any open-minded music passionates there , you will notice that other bands had it as well ( van halen had `` jump '' , kiss had `` i was made for loving you '' ) . one has to take the band as a whole , and simply ca n't deny the skillful and well-crafted musicanship of albums like `` new jersey '' or `` keep the faith '' . so , if you are too narrow-minded to rate this , you simply have no right to proclaim yourself a music-passionate or music-knower . before `` ktf '' was released bon jovi came into the studio very motivated and full of energy after a well-deserved 4-year- break that immediately followed the incredible `` new jersey '' tour . they had sold out stadiums , giving over 200 concerts all around the world and the tour itself consolidated their position on the music market and confirmed how well they do on-stage . but unfortunately it also put on the brink their common career as a band . `` five different guys took five different planes to five different places . there were no goodbyes '' - jbj once used to say . no wonder `` keep the faith '' was the ultimate , long-awiated album in the 90 's and this waiting had 2 major purposes : 1 ) to finally write off the larger-than-life 80 's survivor as a mere , temporary , fashion-yielding hair-band 2 ) or to prove people that jon & richie were in fact much more than `` living on a prayer '' and were capable of adopting to the changable 90 's music scene ( with grunge at the forefront ) . for the first group of critics , like the above-underwritten amazon reviewer andrew mueller being sic and tired of bon jovi 's recent expansion , the very album - no matter how good it might turn out to be - was a blessing so much awaited to prey on , that he boldly , blatantly and with a smirk on his face dismissed even such masterpieces like `` dry county '' ; and that doing this with a mere wave of a hand , claiming it 's `` pointless '' or `` longish '' . pathetic indeed , but it shows how much stirr there was once the album has been released . fortunately , the cd speaks for itself and proves again that if bj 's star was ever to be thwarted for good - then it should have been done much earlier , namely right after their second `` 7800 fahrenheit '' . ironically enough , their debut album was received very well on both sides of the ocean , and most of the critics that hated `` slippery when wet '' ( see acclaimed british music magazine `` kerrang '' ) showed much warmth and sympathy towards it . as far as the second group of people - they once again got a longplay that fully satisfied their crave for tuneful , melodic rock ; yet not an ordinary hair-metal this time . jon knew it well and it was n't only for his change of haircut . the singalong choruses remained the same , the peculiar bj-flow that makes people tapping their fingers as well ; yet the album is much more than that , being a lot more mature in terms of lyrics , diversity and overall coherence . if the title song was to become the new `` living on a prayer '' and `` bed of roses '' a new `` i 'll be there for you '' , then ok - it would indicate that a new era for the band has just begun . but if someone ever bought `` slippery when wet '' just for 2 songs dismissing the rest , then he/she is not going to do this this time , with this album , i 'm telling you . the epic `` dry county '' was reviewed and summarized many times so far , but i do n't know if it abides any summary in fact ; since this is one of the songs you must hear and relish in it every single time , peruse every single tune , from the very beginning , climaxing with richie 's solo , and fading away with dave 's keyboards . i was on a concert in germany a month ago ( `` have a nice day '' tour ) and you ca n't imagine what a surprise it was for me when they played this one at the very end of the show ! whooah , this is one of the moments i will remeber until the end of my life . with tears in your eyes , you live for such moments . `` dry county '' is also undoubtedly the most accomplished , advanced and ambitious band 's effort , looking at the entire 20-some-years-career . it is a class for itself , compare this epic to `` stairway to heaven '' , `` shine on you crazy diamond '' or gunsnroses ' `` november rain '' . i wont't exaggerate at all if i say this album is worth having just for this single track , since it is one of the most important songs that have ever been recorded . let people like andrew mueller - with full respect towards his work and criticism - long live they in their blissful oblivion dismissing `` dry county '' as `` pointless '' . but `` keep the faith '' is a lot more than `` dry county '' , i tell you . `` if i was your mother '' , which is my second favourite track here , is a huge bow towards grunge music ; `` fear '' as well . it clearly shows that guys took into account changing fashions and wrote these two almost-heavy-metal tracks . the `` mother 's '' riff is incredible , merging pearl jam , nirvana and guns n roses . `` in these arms '' and `` i 'll sleep when i 'm dead '' are happy-rockers that can be hummed any time on a party , somewhat reminescent of the recent albums , like `` 99 in the shade '' or something ! `` little bit of soul '' and `` blame it on the love of rock n roll '' are two very good tracks - yet again in another mood - that close this marvelous album and , merging soul and blues , make a final statement about the incredible diversity `` keep the faith '' offers . of course `` bed of roses '' was a huge hit and is arguably their best ballad ever , whereas the title track - being the first single at the same time - made it into the us top20 , is very heavy with incredible sambora 's guitar-solo , and it also smacks somewhat of grunge . overall , this is an incredibly miscellanous and diverse record that you wo n't get bored of ... never ! the only reason why i 'm not giving full 5 stars ( but 4,5 ) is because i 've got acquainted with the take-off material from those sessions , and it stirrs the entity for me , i do n't know why but somehow it does . it gets my goat that the band not always makes the right choice when it eventually goes to make the final song-selection . tracks that appeared recently on the jubille `` 100,000,000 million fans ca n't be wrong '' , like `` the fire inside '' , `` sympathy '' or `` temptation '' really should have made this great album . had these great songs been included istead of cheesy ballad `` i want you '' or mediocre `` woman in love '' , it could have been one of the greatest and most diverse albums in music history . probably other bon jovi-fans agree with me . anyway , this is an incredible album , almost as good as `` new jersey '' . only `` nj '' did n't have 2 less strong songs , it was almost perfect ... well just kidding , ok it had terrible `` bad medicine '' ; - ) ) this is a must-have .
