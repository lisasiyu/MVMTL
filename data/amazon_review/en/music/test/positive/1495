getting better all the time . the first two cd 's were wonderful ( five star ) , but on a scale of 1 to 10 , i would rate this cd a 11+ . the greencards just get better and better . this cd has about everything an album could ask for . just enough slow material and then they crank it up with some great picking . the vocals are as perfect as you can get . carol young is one of the best female vocalist out there today , bar none . emmon and kim join in for great harmony and lead singing , plus their playing is incredible . this band is fast becoming the best of new grass since the new grass revival split up . buy this cd if you love great music . it will have you patting your foot and singing along .
