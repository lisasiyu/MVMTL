for purists only if you bought this cd based upon alison and john waite 's `` missing you '' you are not going to find any other songs close to that on this cd . this is a cd of pure bluegrass and west virginia folk/melancholy and spiritual songs , beautiful and haunting as they are , particularly with alison 's voice . there are 2 or 3 guest artists here and they harmonize well with alison , but the bottom line is this is another cd of perfectly pure alison ( she produced this cd ) music that meets her standards and they are high .
