we can dream , ca n't we ? { *yeah , sure . * } richard carpenter has expressed a slight dissatisfaction in horizon , and although i am a huge fan of the carpenters { *he exaggerates ; do n't listen to him . he weighs about 165 . * } i fear i must concur with richard 's assessment . this collection is akin to finding a few purebred golden retrievers running with a pack of common dogs . { *a really bad analogy , stephen ! remember , man , this is the world 's greatest singer you 're talking about here . * } the album opens and closes with the very brief , atmospheric mood pieces , aurora and eventide - so good you 're actually left disappointed that they were n't expanded . in between is the memorable , but widely available hit , only yesterday , and the haunting solitaire . unquestionably , the big knockout track here is the dreamy , i can dream , ca n't i , and this is really saying something when you consider that this collection also includes karen 's heartfelt reading of frey & henley 's movingly plaintive and lyrically brilliant , desperado - a song that would be the major highlight on any number of other albums ! richard once lamented that had he only known how little time he and his sister would have together , they would n't have wasted any of it recording songs like beechwood 4-5789 . although it went to number 1 on the u.s. charts , and was a runaway monster in japan { *you mean like godzilla ? * } , i have to believe that richard would have included please mr. postman in this lamentable category . it 's just pure radio fluff ; about as satisfying as a popsicle ! for me , the other three cuts ( # 7 , 8 & 9 ) are nearly equally forgettable . oh , but did i mention , i can dream , ca n't i ? { *forgive him , folks . he 's starting to get long in the tooth , and one 's memory is always the first thing to go ! * } it 's bittersweet . sweet in that karen 's exquisite , intimate voice and delicious delivery are perfectly framed by the crystalline , rock candy piano at the forefront and by the warm , melty , white chocolate strings in the background ! { *stephen , you hungry maybe ? * } it 's just gorgeous ! a light wisp of smoke , tenderly wrapped in gauze and gently placed in a bed of softly folded lace . and it 's bitter in that this is the only taste of it that we are ever going to get . just a glimpse of an unrealized potential . what a treasure we would have possessed if the carpenters had recorded an entire album of time-tested standards with similar stylistically luscious arrangements . it could have been called classic karen and included songs such as , stardust ; you belong to me ; misty ; september song ; and smokin ' in the boy 's room . { *smokin ' in the boy 's room ? ! ! * } no , i meant , smoke on the water . { *say what ? ! * } smoke gets in your eyes ? { *yeah , well that 's a little more like it . man , they 'll let just about anybody post reviews on amazon , wo n't they ? * } but i suppose it 's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all . { *good line , stephen , but it sounds familiar . * } alas , we 're never going to get classic karen , but still we can listen to this one shimmering moment over and over , and we can dream , ca n't we ? { *yeah , i know he 's kind of sappy , but you get used to him . * } in addition to the music , there are two really nice photos of karen on the front and back cover { *alright , stephen , take it easy ! * } and musically , the mountaintops are so majestic on this slightly uneven recording that they cast their shadows down into the valleys and render them passable . if you are new to the carpenters , you could do worse than this collection , and if you are already a fan , then purchasing this compact disc should be on your immediate horizon . { *ok , you done now ? let 's log off , get out of these pajamas , and go get something to eat already . man , i 'm starving ! * }
