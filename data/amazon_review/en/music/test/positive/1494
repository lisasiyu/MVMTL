quite possibly their best yet this album is battling to become my favourite sugababes album . it is in competition with three , which is magnificent . this album , the last with mutya , has some of their finest songs to date and some brilliant production and lyrics . at only 11 tracks long ( 12 if you have the uk bonus track , which i do n't ) , it seems short , but packs a lot into those 11 tracks . my rundown : 01 . push the button ( 9/10 ) the lead single of the album , this was no.1 in the uk for 3 ( i think ? ) weeks . it 's immediately catchy and very easy to sing along to . keisha leads most of the song , with mutya and heidi singing the verses . fun , upbeat with a saucy video . 02 . got ta be you ( 9/10 ) another upbeat song , this is really catchy , with a repetitive chorus that you would expect to get boring , but somehow it does n't . the first time i played this , i was like 'boooooring ' but now i love it , it 's a lot of fun to sing along to . the girls share vocals out throughout the song . 03 . follow me home ( 10/10 ) this ballad is reminscient of songs from three like `` caught in a moment '' , `` too lost in you '' and `` sometimes '' . that , my friends , is a very good thing . this song is beautiful and moving - i absolutely love the chorus , it 's amazing ! heidi is absolutely brilliant on the middle 8 , and mutya and keisha do the remainder of the song well . one of my favourites ! 04 . joy division ( 9/10 ) another upbeat song , this song is slightly strange with peculiar lyrics music . it 's catchy with singable bits throughout . i do n't know why it 's called `` joy division , '' they do n't mention those words anywhere in the song . anyway , a good song , if strange . 05 . red dress ( 7/10 ) this is the babes new single and first single with amelle . i wish it was n't and that they had chosen something else , this is one of my least favourite tracks on the album . i do n't know why , but this song is bland and uninteresting to me . the chorus is slightly catchy though , and amelle does improve the song somewhat . 06 . ugly ( 8/10 ) this song is probably my other least favourite . the babes christmas single , this reached no.3 . i loved it on the first listen , but after repeated plays , it has gotten boring . `` ugly '' has a brilliant message behind it about accepting people as they are and not judging people by their looks , but to me , it 's bland and boring . but it 's mutya 's last single with the group , so good on it . 07 . it ai n't easy ( 9/10 ) the shortest track on the album , clocking in at 3:05 , this is fast paced and upbeat . the chorus is really catchy , and gets caught in your head instantly . before you know it , the song is over ! but that 's a good thing , it keeps your attention with it 's short length . 08 . bruised ( 9/10 ) this song is incredibly cool , it 's very chilled out and relaxed , until keisha starts singing the bridge . this song is another catchy one , and i like singing along to the chorus , which heidi leads . another very cool track . 09 . obsession ( 10/10 ) i did n't even know this song was a cover until recently . but even if it is , it 's brilliant ! the lyrics are kinda random , about being obsessed with somebody , but the girls ' vocals are really cool . very catchy with great music . 10 . ace reject ( 10/10 ) this song is wonderful ! heidi 's middle 8 is absolutely brilliant , her vocals and the lyrics are just amazing . the song takes almost 2 minutes to get to the chorus , it 's a different format of song then just verse-bridge-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus-middle 8-chorus . very cool song , with a catchy chorus ( when it finally kicks in ) . 11 . 2 hearts ( 10++++/10 ) this is it ! the very last track on the album is my absolute favourite . this song is absolutely , utterly amazing . heidi leads the majority of the song , singing the first verse , first bridge and leading the chorus , whereas mutya sings the second verse and keisha sings the middle 8 . this song is so beautiful - full of amazing instrumentals ( especially the ending ) and a wonderful chorus with great lyrics - `` 2 you 's , 2 me 's , 2 minds to please '' is just one line . i absolutely & lt ; 3333 this song so much , one of my favourite babes songs ever ! overall , the album 's quality of songs is amazing , apart from two songs , the rest is high quality and brilliant . a great 4th album , look forward to more from the babes with amelle
