theres no lombardo wah wah wah its sinful that such a great album doesnt have a 5 star average . this is quality thrash metal right here , with a slightly refined sound to it . all the songs have blistering solos , crazy as hell riffs , and of course , paul bostaphs inhuman drumming , which brings me to another a point . paul bostaph is just as good as dave lombardo you f-ing retards ! ! ! ! ! ! get it through your f-ing skulls . sorry , i had to get that out . but seriously , just listen to the crazy intro to killing fields , his crazy pummeling in dittohead , and his double bass madness in ss-3 . this is slayer , quality slayer , and all the b-chin needs to stop . im betting about half of you who are trashing this album havent even listened to it , like the retards reviewing trivium and unearth . if your like those sepultura and anthrax fans who refuse to move out of the 80s and early 90s , than so be it . your loss . as for me , my favorite tracks are killing fields , ss-3 , mind control , 213 , and dittohead . if my review has convinced you to have a positive attitude about change , get diabolus in musica , this , and god hates us all . also get some of pauls work with exodus , forbidden , and testament if you need further proof of his excellency
