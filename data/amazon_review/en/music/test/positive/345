it 's good , a little too influence heavy i really would just love to love this record , but i just hear too much of the other bands i like that it just does n't sound as good . of course this is the usual hardcore fare ( no it does n't have emo parts i 'm talking about real hardcore not emocore ) but it 's still good cuase they play it passionatly and you feel it man , you feel it . my favorite line is where he says `` i do n't need a crew to validate me '' man that line alone gave this an extra star . now hear is a note to those bandana wearing losers who love this album , if you are not in a gang do not wear a bandana ! if you are not robbing a bank , do n't wear a bandana ! if you are not riding a horse or fixing a fence please for the love of god do not wear a bandana . it 's stupid and you just look like a dork , you 'd just hate to see how many people roll their eyes when they see it ( but your sooooo cool you just ignore it when those `` normal '' people look at you ) . this music is not for emo wusses my friends , the kid does n't listen to dashboard ( from the sound of this record i 'd say more ensign and american nigtmare ... ) they listen to real hardcore music not whatever the hell loser music you `` hardcore '' kids like these days . would you see atreyu in these guys ' cd book ? hell no ! i 'd slap you if you even suggested it . so i 'm out and please i 'd like to beat 8 out of 32 so go ahead and say `` no '' you freaking dork
