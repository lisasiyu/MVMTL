my favorite corea album i bought this album after listening to an interview with chick corea on npr over the summer last year . in the interview he was asked the quintessential question : `` what is your favorite album that you 've put out over the years ? '' . his answer was this album . the album stands up to that testament . the emotion , energy , and talent of chick and his band is incredible . every time i listen to this album i hear something new . i 'd give it 6 stars if i could
