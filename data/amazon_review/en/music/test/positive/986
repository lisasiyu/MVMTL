journey to the pass this cd was when dance music was ruling the world . take a journey back to the time of real music , and not a bunch of noise coming out of their mouths . music had a beat , a rhythm a style and most of all , it had class . you had to look at your best to be able to get into studio 54 . today , even with a baseball cap and eating a microphone you can talk sing . on this cd , you had to be the best to be able to dance , dance , dance . the music on this cd will take you back in time and relive the beauty of the dance floor , lights , and heart pounding bass that made you dance all night . this cd does just that .
