read the review ( 4.5 stars ) i write this review of `` the documentary '' as the game 's sophomore release `` doctor 's advocate '' prepares to be let loose on the populous . in january of 2005 the game was let loose for the first time as he delivered his debut album `` the documentary '' on aftermath/g-unit records . it was a much hyped and much anticipated release . as it dropped universal praise was hefted upon the game for the record that was sonically spectacular and showed a revived west coast . lyrically some people hated on the game for name dropping so much , i wo n't lie sometimes it 's a little tiresome , but as an obsessive hip hop nerd i like to hear people rap about hip hop . its fun to figure out the connections they are trying to make and in all honesty it 's nice to know that at least one artist in this game actually knows his history and respects the architects of our culture . pretty quickly after the release it all started to fall apart . the game and his boss at g-unit , 50 cent , seemed to already be on shaky ground before the release , but upon the release it seemed everything was all good internally between the two camps with 50 's hooks all over the album along with several guest verses and game 's screams of `` g-unit ! '' always keeping you aware of who was responsible for this project . then all of a sudden it seemed it came crashing down . game would n't ride with the unit on their beef with nas - he was out . we did n't really care because those of us who already had the record saw the talent that the kid had and we had `` the documentary '' to prove it . the record continued to grow and went on to sell an absurd amount of records . i got to say good on the game because listening to `` the documentary '' it 's obvious he put a lot of work into this album and that it meant a lot to him . he likes to talk about his life and what he 's been through to get to this point of releasing his debut record . he likes to praise his influences . but most of all he likes hip hop . so as i look back at `` the documentary '' almost 2 years later i ca n't help but feel what he 's saying . it 's the truth of that time in his life . sure game is cocky and seems confused and or lost with his life right now , but the one thing that he does know is hip hop and he knows how to write verses . if you do n't have `` the documentary '' you need this record if for no other reason to see a young man grow . without `` the documentary '' you will not understand `` doctor 's advocate '' ( which i 'll write a review for sooner than 2 years ! ) , the record that will prove he did grow up and does n't need anyone 's help , 50 or dre ( trust me i 've heard it ) . `` the documentary '' may not be a classic but it 's damn good and deserves a place in not just your hip hop collection but in your music collection as this is an album that goes beyond the definition of genre and is just music at its simplest form .
