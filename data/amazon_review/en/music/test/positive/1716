fresher than funk hmm , i 've got ta disagree with the reviewer who rated this just another funk band with some scratching . kid koala takes a lead role in this band , and is not relegated to some background scratching as is often the case . the integration of the turntables is also far beyond what you might normally hear . this is n't a group where the dj takes a break to show off his funky beats , kid koala meshes his skills seamlessly with the rest of the band . to top it off the vocals are superb , straight out of the congregation . this band is up there with the best of the new hip hop/soul/funk ( breakestra , dakah , and medusa )
