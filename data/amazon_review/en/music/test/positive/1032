step up from frances the mute i thought this album was a good one . i have been listening to tmv since tremulant first came out . i thought frances the mute was good , but it was just too much . i loved deloused and i think this new on is a proper mix of deloused and frances the mute . tmv is still progressing with their sound and it definatley shows in this album . if you are not an avid listener and do not own deloused you might want to pick it up and start the tmv experience there . otherwise , i fell this is a great record . definatley an easier listen then frances the mute
