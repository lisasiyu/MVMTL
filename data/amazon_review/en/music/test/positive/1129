very pleasing musically the only problem that i have with & quot ; specialist in all styles & quot ; is due to my own ignorance . that is , i do n't speak any other languages . therefore , the lyrics could be mocking me for purchasing the album , and i would know any better . but i do n't think that they are mocking me . i say that because the music contained throughout the album is just great . these ensemble from senegal is a group of clearly talented musicians . the latin-themed music combined with african beats is a pleasing combo that i find very easy to listen to . again since none of the music is in english none of tracks in particular stand out to me , but do n't let that stop you from picking this little gem out . it is an instant classic for any beginners world music collection , and will provide instant street cred for all aspiring music buffs
