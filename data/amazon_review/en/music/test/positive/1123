their best album ever flawless every album by a.a. has been good verus the world was great and fate of norns was almost flawless with oden on my side is such a great album from vallhalla awaits me to prediction of warfare.being a member of the astru faith this cd has become like a musical bible for me i listen to this cd alot and bar none no other metal band could touch this album this year.their were many good albums from slayer , celtic frost , hammerfall , cannibal corpse , deicide , sepultura but none of them could touch this cd.my personal faves were cry of the black birds , runes to my memory , and god 's of war arise , this cd gets my vote for album of the year but could be in the running for metal album of the decade .
