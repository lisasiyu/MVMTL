the beatles as i remember them `` the beatles - the capitol albums vol i '' . . . i had to get a copy of this box-set collection of the first four american issued albums by `` the mop tops '' . i was a sophomore in high school that year when the beatles first entered into the consciousness of the world . . . and these four albums re-present exactly the `` sounds '' we first heard in our experience of the band that changed music forever . `` meet the beatles '' . . . where we first saw the `` mop top hair styles '' and the half-lit faces we would eventually come to know better than our own face . . . and where we first heard `` i want to hold your hand '' ! `` the beatles ' second album '' . . . with their cover of `` please mr. postman '' . `` something new '' . . . with so many tracks that became synonymous with `` the beatle movie '' -- `` a hard day 's night '' . . . `` beatles '65 '' . . . my absolute favorite beatles album . . . and the one that was current in my last year of high school . . . with my favorite `` no reply '' . . .and that feedback amp noise that introduces `` i feel fine '' . for me this collection of american issued albums from the original master tapes is nostaligia . . . so many memories associated with these album covers . .and the song sequences . .and even the `` echo '' quality to the sound reproducton . . . but it is much much more . . . these were great songs and great performances and great recordings ! when you listen to them even now , you realize why the beatles were so special and such a phenomenon . . . and why they probably will never be equaled ( although there have been and are and will be many contenders trying to do that ) . i am glad these albums were issued in their origianl format and sound . . . and i am glad that i lived my youth through the times when all of this was `` live '' . . . now we only have the recordings . . . but what great recording they are ! : ) thank you john , paul george and ringo !
