`` history in the making '' if i were to rate the packaging , i would have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the way it was made , i 've had the discs fall out several times myself . but it 's a beautifully packaged and recorded document ( in its appearance and sound ) that i listen to constantly . one problem i have when i look at the roster of talent , is i 'm reminded or our own mortality ; so many of these people are now dead , and the era that followed can never replace what was here . that could be good , though , they all sound so alive here , enhanced by one of the best bands ever to grace a stage . as an aside , i wonder why people call a death `` passing away , '' or just `` passing . '' they did n't `` pass , '' they died ; there 's no shame in saying it . richard manuel , rick danko , paul butterfield , muddy waters , carl radle , and pop staples are all dead ; go ahead , say it . i do n't think they 'll mind . nobody flinches at the word `` suicide '' when talking about richard manuel , but let rick danko peacefully drift off in his sleep , and he `` passes away . '' these things have always puzzled me . back to the music ; it 's all good , so much talent crossed that stage that night , the audience had a real treat . the band 's songs cover such a wide spectrum of topics , and i understand the guys resenting robertson 's appropriation of the writing credits , but these are men who have definitely walked the walk , and because of that , they are certainly able to talk the talk . you can hear the heartbreak in rick danko 's delivery of `` it makes no difference , '' and the effects of the hard life in richard manuel 's voice in `` the shape i 'm in , '' and even more so in `` acadian driftwood . '' his voice here is hoarse and ragged and perfect . levon helm summed up manuel 's demons quite well in in the band 's `` authorized biography , '' and in his book , `` this wheel 's on fire . '' he said `` that 's between him and his higher power , and i 've always tried to keep from having too much of an opinion about it . '' he is still shaken over it this many years later , you can see it in the video , because here , he just clams up , takes a big drag on his cigarette , and looks off somewhere into the distance . i can see in him a sense of betrayal by one of his closest friends , and the knowledge that it will always hurt . this is relevant to `` the last waltz , '' because there was a sense of brotherhood with these guys , from the beginning , all the way through , until huge success started to splinter that element . they were so good , and to watch this , knowing that these five will never grace a stage or studio in this form again , has the feeling of ending , of winding down , and being forced to say goodbye when you do n't want to say goodbye . even though the sequencing is out of order , and there were a few omissions from the show , it 's still a magnificent document of one of the greatest live performances of the era , one of the best
