very good i do n't know much about danielle 's genre of music but i thought this was a very good album and she sounds as good as any other female pop star out there . why she has n't had the break-through i have no idea . the lyrics are interesting and she sings with a great deal of power . her cover of `` gim me some sign '' was excellent .
