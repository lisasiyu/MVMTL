i do n't get this release , but hey , it 's dio and it 's sabbath instead of a new sabbath album , we get this . now i know a new sabbath album is in the works , but that 's just what the fans want to hear - new material . nevertheless , dio 's greatest hits with sabbath is still a swell purchase . odds are if you are a true sabbath fan , you already own all the dio-era sabbath , but now you can own all the goodies in one cd . post dio sabbath was mediocre at best , so you can be rest assured that dio sabbath is as good as it was going to get . after reviewing the tracks on here , i 'm a little upset that southern cross was not on here . if there 's one song that pulls out the best from iommi and dio , it 's that one . it 's got edge , balls , and guts . however , the rest of the tracks are pure classics and definitely do not disappoint . so , if you 're a fan , you 'll probably by it cause you like to collect things . if you already own the previous albums , the choice is yours . the only discernable difference that i can tell is the obvious production value . mob rules sounds horrible on its own , and the few tracks from mob rules will sound great on this disc
