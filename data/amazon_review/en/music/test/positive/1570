i dont dig on sountracks ... . but i bought this one . could n't help it . the music was such a prominent part of the film , more so than any other film i 've seen . it was a good film , ok . i 'm not in love with it . but the music was in tune with the great parts of the film- never ever witnessed this before . witness : samuel jackson slipping on the gloves and coldly assasinating chris tucker . could that song , do n't even know what it 's called , be more shocking , fitting , pretty much every adjective . and then the end of the flick with jackie driving with a tear in her eye singing along- i do the same thing without the tear . truth told i did n't know much about this music before i saw the movie . but it makes me feel like i was there and that makes my life more exciting and that makes a good album . pulp fiction ost was really good too but to put it straight up , jackie brown is black soul that white boys do n't get the pleasure to hear . boo-yah !
