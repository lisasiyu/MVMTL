short and sweet excellent selection of some of the best from these three friends ( and a little zach gill , too ! ) . gives you the feeling you 're sneaking into a weekend jam session at jack 's house . fans of these guys will want to add this cd to their library . seems to me , though , they could have easily added a few more songs and make this a full length effort
