great ! simply put , this is a classic . the album is basically perfect and not one of the tracks are 'fast-forward-able ' . black thought gets better with each release and the band seems to get tighter and tighter with their chemistry and sound . the guest appearances are great too . this is the album that clearly defined them as the pioneers they are
