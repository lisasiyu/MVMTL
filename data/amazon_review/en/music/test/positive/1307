still a fine place to enter from i have had this cd for about two years now , having bought it when i first decided i was ready to try to get my mind around the endless array of electronica music that had interested me from afar for a long time . i find myself returning to this cd again and again and it only sounds better and better with time . it illustrates the beauty of fine trance combined with fine mixing . there is only one track i dislike . i have carried this cd while traveling and will certainly draw from it when i get around to joining the i-pod nation . this collection stands very nicely on it 's own but i think it lends itself especially well to newcomers and i would highly recommend it as a window to climb through into the vast world of club music
