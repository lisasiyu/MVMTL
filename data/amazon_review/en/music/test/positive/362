an impressive , rockin debut ! now this is what i call rocking music . i first heard cheyenne 's `` one original thing '' on the movie , aquamarine , and got hooked on it . i purely bought the cd just for that one song , then found out , there were so many other great ones . `` hanging on '' and `` original thing '' , title track `` day has come '' , `` everything to lose '' , `` mr. beautiful '' , `` four walls '' and `` full circle '' are ones worth listening to over and over again . i never get tired of them . 'hello goodbye ' , 'good go bad ' and 'did n't i ' are growing on me-more and more , `` breaking your heart '' is edgy along with 'i want to ' . this is definitely the type of music to have at a party to dance all night long to , she makes me wan na dance and never stop . this texan is definitely has a lot of potential
