when african-american singing moved african-americans after sampling this new shanachie product `` when gospel was gospel '' , i can testify that this is african-american singing to the `` nth '' power . this style of `` full-throated '' singing is seldom heard anymore because african-americans either prospered after the civil rights movement or fell to the seductive power of `` hip hop '' genre that captured the heart , mind and spirit as classical gospel once did . this music started in the 1930 's when african-americans were in their `` great depression '' . and african-americans have a ph.d in suffering and hard times . this music is a testament to our ability to `` ground '' ourselves in a strange land of north america and plant our beliefs , hopes , and aspirations in a musical form . i am always impressed with these singers who have went to heaven . each one has something to offer new generations of singers in tone , drama , and breadth of personality . i recommend this cd to those who are struggling to find meaning in their lives . those who are looking for excitement and surprise . african-americans know about the negativities of life and we know how to create `` joy that comes to our mornings '' rev . khalil canady m.div age 27
