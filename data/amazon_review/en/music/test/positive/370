the greatest rock album of all time sex , sin , and repdemtion in 40 minutes i have hestitated to write a review on `` purple rain '' for years because 1 . i listened to this album for 4 years everyday ( 1984- 1988 ) and never knew what it truly was . 2 . in many ways it has made the most profund change in me as a person . 3 . because underneath of it 's sexuality is the greatest christian rock album of all times 4 . and also the greatest musical statment of the rock era . in many ways prince and the revolution 's `` purple rain '' was the extension of the classic sly and the family lineup ( whom he takes probaly his greatest inspiration musically ) and their second album together he leaves the minneapolis sound somewhat and instead of the punk/funk nu wave vibes of 1999 he opts for power pop like the who and the kinks on songs like `` let go crazy '' is a classic clash of synth pop with townsend -like guitar chrouses but the lyrics start with him either in prayer in a thearpists chair with a traditonal gospel intro talking about the 'afterworld ' or insanity ( much like marvin gaye lyrically at his best ) and with those minneapolis synths of coleman and dr. fink swirling and vamping about , the song becomes power pop heaven for guitar freaks and the lyrics which captures lust , salvation and insanity with it 's perfect guitar solos and the end with it 's cathraic release siginals that we are not only listening to a soundtrack but at it 's core a christian rock album but it does n't sound like a newsboys , amy grant or dc talk album because unlike those groups , prince talks about the flesh in ways that these artists would never broach on an album . side one ( i have it on vinyl , cd and tape ) after the insanity of let 's go crazy is the great pop of take me with u with it 's great arrangement and while appolonia is vocally limited , she turns in a great performance on this song and prince being the great singer could have overwhelmed her vocally but he stays in her range `` the beautiful ones '' the only r & b sounding song on side one , is a beautiful declaration of love to his girlfriend at the time susanah melvion . in his best smokey robinson/curtis mayfield/eddie kendricks falsetto he pleads with great tenderness in verse `` if i told u baby if i was in love with u baby baby baby we could married would that cool in the last verses he demands she makes a chocie do u want him ? or do u want me cause i want u tell me baby do u want me ! ! ! ! i got ta know i got ta know computer blue is probaly the most song that is hendrix/funkadelic in spirit lyrically and in musical exceution with it 's wendy and lisa sapphic intro bathing each other into the most insane prince guitar jam it his sexual id run amuck musically with the lyric `` til i find the righteous one computer blue '' with the revolution jamming along prince plays some of the best solos i have ever him play with it 's eddie hazel - like first solo before the breakdown into a ernie isley-like second ( whom i think prince sounds like ) melodic solo til the insane ending with him screaming like a banshee then it fades into the most controvesial song on the whole album , `` darling nikki '' ( the reason there are parental advisory tags on every album ) is about a visit to a hotel to see a girl who was a 'sex fiend ' and a song that while quite tame for today still only gets played late at night because of the lyric mastrubastion . i always thought the guitars had a led zeppelin vibe at the time but as i have listened to more black alternative albums it sounds like funkadelic in it 's prime . side two ( i know i am still doing the vinyl thing ) is where you really see the spritual side come out from the opener 'when doves cry ' a musical and artistic acheivement with it 's lack of bassline the song sounds like a sexual peacan about a woman , but it is actually about hwo one dominates or gives up control in their interpersonal and romantic relationships with really cold and dark lyrics with the lament of `` this is what it sounds like when doves cry '' even when prince is not singing about sex it bleeds through the lyrics it really is a sad song in many ways but the guitar brillance keeps the song lite . `` i would die 4 u `` is a great pop/funk song about faith under the quise of sexuality of god as a woman , a man or something you ca n't even fathom . me and my friends could n't believe at the time prince was talking about god in all those mainfestions with the chrous `` i would die 4 u baby i 'm a star is actually the most classic minneapolis sounding song with those classic keyboard vamps with that chant `` doctor '' with dr. fink 's great keyborad solo and then the finale of `` purple rain `` in which he takes a marvin gaye staple remdemption where he ties but impluses but marries them in a godly realm it is lyrically a double endtree you can say he 's talk about himself as a woman 's savoiur but it can also be about the power of god into one 's life . after watching the movie and concert you realize years later that this album at it 's heart is a ode to god and sex like many of his classic albums but it is the greatest christian rock album of all time because unlike those christian rock bands , they are never in touch with the world they are always trying to run away from those issues in their makes their music nothing but empty platitudes unlike prince who like bob marley and marvin gaye embraced the scared with the profane and came out with a masterwork for the ages .
