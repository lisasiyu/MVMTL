sad signs of decline as the title suggests , this is ice-t 's return . but the return to exactly what ? it could be viewed as either the return to the forefront of hip-hop , or the return to his roots , end of the 80s style of hip-hop . while i 'm sure ice thought of the former , the resulting album does n't quite achieve any of the two `` return to '' targets . there are two very notable changes in ice-t style here . first is in the lyrics department . while ice is as intelligent and witful as ever , he has toned down his verses a lot . gone is the almost uncontrolled aggression of `` home invasion '' . instead we have mostly slow to mid-tempo tracks , most of which deal with the topics of either rap game and its rules , or warns against being a gangster . this change is quite understandable for a man about to turn 40 years old . the lyrics are mostly good and to the point . though i must admit i still find the 2 love ballads here to be somewhat out of place . the other notable change is in the music . it has advanced from basic beats and noises towards more rich soundscape . most of the tracks , especially the slower ones , attempt to develop a feeling of uneasiness and tension , and most of the times it works . so why do i think this album is one more step on the way down ? because taken as a whole , it lacks the focus and a sense of general direction that `` o.g . '' maintained perfectly . not a single time did i cringe , realizing that this or that track is just a filler ( `` forced to do dirt '' , anyone ? ) . another turn off might be that old-school feeling of the whole attempt , which simply sounds out of tune with the general development of rap . clearly ice-t wanted to put himself back in the game . but as much as i respect his previous efforts , more often than not i vision a man in his late 30s who is generally unsure as to what kind of music really works in 1996 , and his songs often sound strained and entirely forced out . that being said , for long time fans , which i am one of , this is generally a nice little album , that is worth to be listened to occasionally . but it 's far from being a mandatory purchase
