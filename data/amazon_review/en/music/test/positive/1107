pretty good exercise music i bought this album together with `` breathe '' on the recommendation of my wife because i have been listening to the dixie chicks daily while i work out . i had never heard faith hill 's music before but the suggestion was that if i like the chicks ' music i would like faith hill . of the two albums , i much prefer this one . the opening number `` free '' sounds like a madonna tune ( in fact , specifically i think it is really the same song as `` la isla bonita '' although i prefer this rendition ) . this cd is not as good as any of the chicks ' releases in the past 6 years but it 's still worth buying if you are looking for some variety at the gym
