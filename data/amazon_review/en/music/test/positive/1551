can lead to even better things well if you have missed some of the efforts linked to the modern brazil music scene than this puts a nice sampler together for you . if you are already familiar and have come by way of the late suba 's & quot ; sao paolo confessions & quot ; or bebel gilberto 's lovely & quot ; tanto tiempo , & quot ; both so good that they deserved tributes or remixes , than you will be plesantly surprised by some of the other offerings . the problem with samplers is that they are just that , samples . just when you are getting into a particular artist the track is over and you are suddenly listening to another one . the good news is that this can lead you out to purchase a full cd of the artists music . such was the case for me with zuco 103 . i found there sound sound inviting and when i purchased one disc i had even had to have another ! the version they perform of & quot ; outro lado & quot ; is sweet , slightly funky , dreamy , trippy and like many of the tracks on this sampler , seductive . zuco 103 also performs & quot ; treasure & quot ; which is a bit more uptempo , bilingual ( with interspersed english chorus ) slightly edgy with a sprinkling of bossadelia that is not as good as the version featured on their cd but still very nice . trio mocoto 's & quot ; os orixas & quot ; has a more carnival or futbol flavor where you can imagine the samba line grooving along . bossacucanova fills in the dance lines on this sampler with jazz melodies for some soflty swinging atmospheric approches to create lounge brazinujazz . all the songs contribute something tasty to the cd and is recommended for a point of departure or to just sit and watch your own rio sunsets
