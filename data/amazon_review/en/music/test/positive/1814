i like todd but i 'm baffled by this cd . the first track listed is `` elmo and henry '' , but track 1 is just some short , faint instrumental . the lyrics to `` elmo and henry '' are in the cd liner , but no such song on the cd . also , the liner contains lyrics to two songs titled `` dance , dance , dance '' and `` promises to keep '' , but again , no such songs on the cd . what is on the cd are some pretty cool songs by a talented wordsmith and musician . i highly recommend it ! just ca n't make sense of what 's in the liner and what is and is n't on the actual cd
