a work of genius i bought this album back in 1973 , and this has always seemed like a work of genius . the line-up of electric violin ( goodman ) , guitar ( mclaughlin ) , keyboards ( hammer ) , drums ( cobham ) and bass ( laird ) was new . the music is influenced by coltrane , cream , lifetime , indian music and probably miles ' bitches brew band . although they use electric instruments , the music is complicated and difficult to listen to . its speed and ferocity make it challenging and alien for those not familiar with jazz . ken scott who engineered for the beatles and later produced david bowie made the album sound like a rock album . at the time , the musicianship and the interplay were a revelation . jazz critics accused these guys of selling out , but it 's much more adventurous than the average jazz album of its time . in 1973 , jeff beck declared the orchestra the best band in the world , and he was probaly right .
