jumpin' and when i say jumpin ' , i mean what i 'm doing in my kitchen while this cd is playing . i 've seen the show twice , and it 's like a drug that i just want again and again . but this is the next best thing . the show is so good , but the music creates such images in my mind that i do n't miss it as much . my kids dance to it with me and my wife , and we all just groove to the beat . i ca n't help but think that bmg reminds methat i live in a cyberpunk novel , and the music gives me a soundtrack for the day . i love this
