brillant recording the thing about ''evita '' is that it is such a remarkable musical that the different interpretations are each worthy of owning and enjoying , much like listening to different interpretations of bach or mozart . the largest negative about this recording is that it 's incomplete ( which is hardly a negative : ''the worst thing about the london cast recording is that there is n't more ... '' ) . elaine paige is stunning , and her performance alone is worth the money . her vocal range , power , emotion , and expression are awe-inspiring , and the recording seems tailored to complement her performance . the orchestration is light and subtle , most likely to show off the powerful vocals . david essex as ''che '' continues to grow on me ( my first impression were not all that favorable ) and joss ackland is superb . the more i listen to this recording , the more it becomes my overall favorite by far . the broadway cast double album is essential if you want the complete musical and to understand the story , and the production is marked by full orchestration and very large cast . the concept album has its pluses and unique characteristics , but in terms of overall performance i feel the london cast does a better job vocally ( especially elaine ) and the broadway cast is a fuller production . i would probably recommend the broadway album as a first choice , simply to get the full musical and to listen to a very large production of this incredible work . however , for subtlety , grace , and outstanding performances , the london cast highlight album stands ahead of all the rest
