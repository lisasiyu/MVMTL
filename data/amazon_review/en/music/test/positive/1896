doris day - greatest hits -- you ca n't help but love this cd i never even knew that i was a fan of doris day until i heard one of her songs in a recent popular movie . i bought the 'greatest hits ' album , thinking the song would be on there , and it was n't . it did n't matter - because i fell in love with the album anyway . i was never a fan of 'fifties ' music , however , this album has a timeless quality that anyone could love . it makes you feel like you should be in a dimly-lit night club with some brandy , a fine cigar , and a beautiful woman sitting atop a black baby grand . enjoy
