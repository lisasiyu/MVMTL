found some good gospel bluegrass this was released `` way back '' in 1991 , so i was not sure what i would find . anyways , i was pleasantly surprised and out of the 24 songs , there were 9 that i gave 5 stars and downloaded to my mp3 player . that 's a pretty good average for a single cd ! many of the selections were unique in that they were not `` new '' versions of old songs .
