it dont get no better i have to agree with an earlier review-this is a true desert island disc.my favorite jj album.sultry guitar and terrific songs.this is an underrated masterpiece. & quot ; cherry & quot ; would make the price worth it. & quot ; i 'm a gypsy man & quot ; & quot ; let me do it to you & quot ; not a wasted note on the whole thing.dont miss it
