one of the greatest albums of all time ! yes , of all time ! i heard they spent 30,000 to make this album from a producer friend of mine . i believe it ! this is one of those albums that is almost too good to be true . i mean , its perfect in every way . from the production , to the musicianship , to the song writing , to the variety.. i mean.. theres nothing this album does n't miss . top notch , to say the least . as many other reviewers mentioned . these guys were highly underrated and overlooked . its actually shocking because this has to be the most amazing thing ive ever put in my cd player . and its a shame but you will probably never hear another band like this in your lifetime . actually , i can almost guarantee that . what a shame.. this is a must have album . if you do n't buy it . your missing out on one of the best cd 's to be released in the 90 's or of all time for that matter . yes , its that good !
