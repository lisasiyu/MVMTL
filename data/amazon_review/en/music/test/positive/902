maybe the best gangsta rap album ever ... say what you will about the obvious choices of `` the chronic '' and `` doggystyle '' , my choice will always be music to driveby . this album exemplifies what not only great gangsta rap should sound like but what good hip-hop should sound like as well . first and foremost , eiht is an emcee , not just a rapper . this performance is the pinacle of his rhyme ability before he became known to the public as `` the guy who says geeyah '' . he battles ( `` dead men tell no lies '' , `` duck sick ii '' , `` def wish ii '' , and `` who 's ****ing who ? `` ) , he paints big lyrical hood murals ( `` hood took me under '' & `` jack mode '' ) , he constantly reps his hood ( `` compton 4 life '' ) , experiments ( `` n*ggaz strugglin '' & `` u 's a b*tch '' ) , and destroys with rapid fire delivery ( `` hit the floor '' ) . he may be the only artist to ever hold his own on a track with the great brad jordan a.k.a . scarface ( `` n 2 deep '' ) . production is cutting edge as well and again . after the slightly uninspired staight checkn'em album , this album returns to the original formula that made it 's a compton thang so great - creative use of samples . `` hood done took me under '' is the classic example . eiht rips the isaac hayes sample used by easy mo b for notorious big a few years later for `` warning '' , and a good decade before ludacris used it again on his `` chicken & beer '' album . to top it all off , the loop was vastly superior to either of these uses or numerous others . or better yet , check the clever use of scratches and snippets on `` who 's ****ing who ? '' where tim dog 's voice is used to scorch himself . the complete bastardization of bdp 's classic `` south bronx '' was even a bold manuver with , to my surprise , absolutely no response from krs-one . and to wrap it all up , you get the smooth instrumental `` music to driveby '' to round it all out . yeah sure , eiht did n't get the national recognition until we come strapped a few years later . but that album , in my opinon , pales in comparison to the overuse of the same production used on driveby 's `` hood rat '' and waaaaaaay to many `` geeyah 's '' . driveby 's way more diverse in both production and lyrics and does not suffer from any overused topics that eiht would later be forced to employ from the overabundance of other gangsta rappers and their albums . if you 're even a mild fan of gangsta rap or even hip hop in general , do yourself a favor and pick up this classic
