maria , you still have n't landed i absolutely love this album -- favorite of the year . i see the user reviews are all over the board . i guess i am not surprised . i was taken aback by her prior album , life is sweet . maybe i was expecting something more like her earlier work then , but i got into it over time and i still love it . so i think i was more open minded and trusting when high dive came out after so many years , having no idea what to expect . i ca n't say i love every track on the second half of the disk , but there 's just so much that is great and it is so unbelievably ambitious . just a huge record . thank you , maria
