excellent cd ! the eurythmics fifth album entitled `` revenge '' finds the lennox/stewert duo completing their journey from the new wave of their early days and the more r & b/soul of their previous album `` be yourself tonight '' into a near total rock/pop sound . it was unfortunately where the eurythmics commercial run started to wind down . that 's not to say that this is a decline . not at all . even though a good majority of the songs fall into the category of typical mid-1980s rock and pop , there are many standout songs that make this a wonderful illustrious release from this duo . the famous hit song `` missionary man '' is my favorite eurythmics song ever . the lyrics are among my favorite that annie has ever written . other great songs include `` the first time '' with it 's excellent and bizarre guitar effects as well as the fifth track . the bonus tracks are very good but the remix of `` missionary man '' is a bit overstretched .
