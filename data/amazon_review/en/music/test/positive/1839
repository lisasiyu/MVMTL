satisfaction guaranteed although radioactive grabbed the headlines back in 85 , 86 , satisfaction guaranteed is the true gem on the album . it is a terrific song to cover , allows great jamming , and is distinctly page/rodgers , a terrific combination ( even better than the current rodgers/may collaboration with queen ) . if you have n't heard it in awhile , you may be surprised . not dated , either
