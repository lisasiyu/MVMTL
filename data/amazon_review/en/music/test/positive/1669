the quartet mr. parker 's first album with this group , o'neal 's porch , rightfully received excellent reviews , appearing on ny times top 10 list , and so on . the group did release another album a couple years ago with a vocalist , so this is essentially the second album featuring only the quartet . it was released in late march by aum fidelity through their website , which is why i , and it seems the below reviewer , have heard this cd many times . i 've listened to it almost every day for the past month , and i still look forward to listening it . parker has said that he would like his orchestra to sound like a quartet- no easy feat considering the huge sound of it . at times i feel like this quartet sounds like an orchestra , and not because they play particularly loud or aggressive . as a matter of fact , this album is in many ways very straight ahead , full of melodies , walking bass , in the pocket drumming , and intertwined sax and trumpet . the reason i say that it sounds like an orchestra is that sometimes you can just hear something bigger than the four players . it has nothing to do with volume . it might be that they play so naturally , effortlessly , and with such confidence in each other , that they become not only `` a whole greater than the sum '' , but an entire new entity . that may seem like hyperbole , but anyone who has seen william parker play live knows that many strange things are possible . more simply put , i think anyone can listen to this album and right away `` get it '' . this is not avant-garde , or free , or straight ahead , or whatever other label there is . it is excellent music- and it also makes my crappy hour long commute somewhat enjoyable .
