worthy sequel to their 1977 classic although i prefer the original ocean from 1977 , this 1998 sequel is n't bad at all . of course if you 're a fan of the original ocean like i am , do n't expect it to sound like a clone of the original , you might be disappointed . i had my suspicions when i bought this disc , as i 'm sure many others had , after all , there are so many prog bands out there that rightfully remained silent in the 1980s , only to reunite in the 1990s and give us some truly embarassing , pale , or uninspired stuff in an attempt to recapture their past glory . i 'm glad eloy did n't fall in to that trap . the production and sound of ocean 2 is modern , digitally recorded . definately not recommended to those prog rock fans who are anti-modern and like everything analog . but even so , the biggest surprise is the use of analog synths here ! i hear my share minimoog , some string synths , and even a little clavinet . digital synths are also used , but hardly ever detracts from the music . by this time , eloy was back to being a full band , thanks to frank bornemann , old-time member klaus-peter matziol , bornemann 's late '80s/early '90s partner michael gerlach , and ex-michael schenker group drummer bodo schopf . the reason i took a star off was i thought the end part of the cd dragged on a little ( particularly & quot ; the answer & quot ; ) , but eventually that no longer bothered me . apparently , eloy 's previous label , spv , rejected ocean 2 , so they moved on to a totally unlikely label : gun ( great unlimited noise ) whose specialty seems to be speed/thrash/death metal , so having a prog band on that label is truly strange company . so never mind the label eloy was recording for this disc , if you 're a prog rock fan , and you do n't mind a more modern twist in your music , and you like vintage synths , you 're sure to love this one
