a must have for your child i ca n't believe someone would not enjoy this cd . my 2 kids ( ages 1 and 2 1/2 ) love this cd . sometimes it is the only thing that will keep them happy . i will admit , if you are new to laurie berkner , it seems a little boring at first . but , after listening to it a couple of times , it is incredible . the words are so easy to learn and the tunes are catchy . i do n't even mind if they are trapped in my head all day ( unlike the other kid songs we have ) . we also have we are the dinosaurs , and love that one , too . i ca n't wait to get laurie 's other 2 cds . i tell everyone about laurie berkner , she is a true gem
