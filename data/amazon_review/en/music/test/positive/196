a great performance i have a very special care for this vivaldi 's work . somehow , life has made me aware of many forms of interpretation of this very concert . yesterday i was listening to it and i was aware of some details that made me look for it . i simply knew that the director was asking for wonderful new sounds that are not often to be found in the average performance of this masterwork . often , my favourite version is the one of `` i musici '' . yet i was n't too surprised to find it was osawa the conducer of this amazing version . i had had the chance of listening to previous works by him and i realize how he manages to make a classical always present . if he is the director of this record , no doubt , it is worthwile
