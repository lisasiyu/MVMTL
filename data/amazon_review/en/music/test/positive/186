said it before and i 'll say it agin' if you 've never bought a country cd in your life , make this your first . it is haunting . i defy anyone to play this just once . i always repeat it at least 3 times . the man is the most potent proof that one can reveal the age of one 's soul through his music . as flat & shallow as the most electronically plumped pop crap on the so called country charts today , is hank williams iii deep . next to iii , his father may as well be a fat drunk in a seedy karaoke bar . this young man does his grandpa proud & them some . he seems possessed of the spirit without having to struggle to invent an identity of his own like his father before him to step out of big hank 's shadow . iii steps into the shadow and lights it up like a state fair on the 4th of july . it is all there . it has skipped a generation but it is in the marrow of his bones . in fact he 's a damn good living argument for re-incarnation if you ask me . haunting is a word that is in my mind every time i play my copy of one of his albums . but this is n't for someone looking for a fair impression of grandpa as his father once did . i myself find myself listening to iii then putting on a bit of grandpa & after a few songs i 'm hungry for this all together new phenomenon . the dimensions he reveals & the music he creates in doing so . it 's not old fashioned country , nor rockabilly , punk , rock or anything that i think can be pigeon holed . it is as new a form as the bop with which charlie parker once rocked the jazz world . hank iii 's versatility is beyond description . surrounding himself with a posse of daredevil side men who are as hot , versatile & inventive as he , hank iii will have you banging on the internet for more discs & cursing his woebegone label for holding him back . so talented & so obviously deep a well of humanity is this young man that it would come as no surprise to me if someone , someday mined a great acting ability from that well . the distant mournful look in his eyes within the innocent childlike face belies any image of less to which any reviewer of poorer soul may point . he is at once , dark , mournful , childishly cocky , sexy , raw & miscieveouly playful . he has a facet for every emotion a listener can possibly need expressed through music . you will put him on when you 're blue and end up cheered , you will put him on for a good time & end up haunted long after the album has reached it 's end . he comes across as the kind of guy with whom any fun loving man would like to roll one , go out & get plastered & any woman would want to hole up for a stormy few days in shack with a guitar & couple of bottles of j.d . i pray he can get by & be happy without ever selling out to the industry & falling into the same crap mold of all the big nashville/hollywood stars who pass for country artists today . listen to this boy & every country record , tape or cd you own that is n't his , his grandfather 's or patsy cline 's will gather a thick layer of dust before you put them in a giveaway box where they belong . he will surely leave you with an allergy to sequins sharp black suits and grammy winning , bleached white teeth . there was hank williams & there is hank williams iii . do n't need nobody else & if ya do , you must have a tin ear , shallow life , black heart and a deep dark hole where your soul oughtta be . hank williams jr. -- do yourself a favor old man & retire . he has come -- no thanks to you !
