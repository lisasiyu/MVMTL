another solid set . this disc will bring back some pleasant memories . any disc with & quot ; drift away & quot ; on it is almost worth purchasing no matter what else is on it . this one just happens to have & quot ; brother louie & quot ; & quot ; it never rains in southern california & quot ; and & quot ; stuck in the middle with you & quot ; . the sound quality is exceptional , just like any disc by rhino
