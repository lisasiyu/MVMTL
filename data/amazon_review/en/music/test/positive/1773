from nantucket to pkm to cry of love ... the best rock bands in nc 's history in the 70 's you had nantucket , the 1980 's had pkm & the 1990 's had cry of love . all share a page in nc 's rock and roll history and pee wee watson played part in all . this is the rock and roll tree of north carolina . i loved them all and want to thank them for the memories . i recommend all their albums to any . you can still get nantucket 's albums and this one from cry of love , but unfortunately you ca n't find pkm 's `` rock erotica '' . maybe one day ! i want to thank kenny soule , pee wee watson , michael gardner , audley freed & robert kearns for some great memories . daryl boyette ( formerly of wkns & wsfl radio
