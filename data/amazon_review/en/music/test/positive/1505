a great compilation i really like al stewart 's style - he has an easygoing , yet catchy style that is definately his own . he 's a little like gerry rafferty , a little bit beatle-esque and a tad bit like bob dylan , but he 's got his own great style . this compilation is very good , it hits all the high points and has excellent sound . my favorite songs of his were always `` the year of the cat '' and `` time passages '' , but all of the songs are very good and listenable . i highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes good folk/soft/pop rock
