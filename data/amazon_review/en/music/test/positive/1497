awesome , it shows ammons at his absolute best ! this is a great recording to say the least , but i have to say , stitt has played better . his work with bud powell and sonny rollins , i thought was better than this . that said , it is a classic . ammons is in top form , check him out on counter clockwise and blues up and down . there is a great sense of atmosphere , like you 're really there , with stitt hooting ammons along in his solos . the rhythm section is more than solid , and it should sit right up there inthe best of your collection
