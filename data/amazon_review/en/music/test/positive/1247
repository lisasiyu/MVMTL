good greatest hits package this is some of reba 's best material , and there is n't a bad song on this cd . some of the best songs on here are , `` you lie '' , rumor has it '' , `` is there life out there '' , `` fancy '' , `` does he love you '' , and `` walk on '' . all of these songs except for `` fancy '' were # 1 hits . the only downside to this album is that it is missing lots of songs that were either no . 1s or top tens . all in all this is a good album and i would recommend it to reba fans
