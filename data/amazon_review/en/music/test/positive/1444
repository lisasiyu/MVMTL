excellant combination of songs . best of wayne newton now is an excellant compilation of music . the oldies are there , a few i had never heard , but i am so glad i did . it goes from toe-tapping music to daydreaming and just plain crying songs . since i am a long time fan and have just recently attended his christmas show , i can assure you , this cd will not be a dissapointment
