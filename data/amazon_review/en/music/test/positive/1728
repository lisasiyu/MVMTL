east west yes an benthusiast of both philip glass & amp ; ravi , i find this cd even more delightful than i had expected before the purchase . listening to glass 's simple uplifting melodies accompanied by tabla is exhilerating . listening to ravi shankar 's sitars with a cello line composed by glass is awesome . i recommend this cd to anyone interested in either composer or style of music . it pleases both aesthetics
