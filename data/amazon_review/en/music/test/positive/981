this is a great album ! ! buy it ! ! i know there are a bunch of people out there saying `` this gives metalcore a bad name '' or `` the vocalist has a lung disease '' but honestly , they are n't metalcore . trivium , shadows fall , etc . are classified metalcore , and they are definately not like them at all . their music is much more melodical than others and have great guitars solos , namely the intro to `` bleeding mascara '' . let 's go through each track one by one : 1 . blood children - 3/5 - a nice intro that has a nice lead into the following song 2 . bleeding mascara - 5/5 - i can not stress enough how great of a song this is . the guitars in this song are amazing and the lyrics are very advanced . very nice high paced song that is great for getting your adrenaline going . 3 . right side of the bed - 4/5 - this song has a very catchy drum rhythm that keeps you listening through the entire song . they chose this song to make a music video for , which was also nicely done . 4 . this flesh is a tomb - 3/5 - this song is n't the greatest on the album , but definately a fine song that is worth listening to . 5 . you eclipsed by me - 5/5 - this song was the song that got me addicted to atreyu 's music . `` i will not be broken , i am , the one '' boom ! ! this song is a blast of harsh lyrics that will leave you breathless ! 6 . the crimson - 4/5 - this song also has a music video for it . it 's not the fastest paced song , but if you enjoy singing/screaming along with your music , this would definately be the easiest to do so . 7 . the remembrance ballad - 1/5 - this song was probably the most boring song on the entire album . it never picks up at any point in time , the lyrics are weak , and the singing is terrible . very easily could have been left off of the album . 8 . the interlude - 3/5 - not sure if it was completely necessary , but it was a nice way to slow you down before getting hit with the next song . 9 . corseting - 5/5 - this song is bursting with energy ! a crazy high paced song that keeps your rolling through the entire song . it 's hard for anyone not to enjoy this song ! 10 . demonology & heartache - 3/5 - not my favorite , but definately is a nice song . the guitars in the song are very nice and add a great amount of melody to the song . 11 . my sanity on the funeral pyre - 3/5 - it was really hard to rate this song , because it has a very slow intro and has a hard time picking up , but after it starts it does has some very cool bass guitaring that makes the song fun to listen to . 12 . nevadas grace - 5/5 - this song is probably the most fun-sounding out of the album . peaceful , yet with the screaming it still keeps the song very interesting . 13 . five vicoden chased with a shot of clarity - 4/5 - a nice way to end this album . a slightly slow intro , but definately picks up with both guitars and has a very creepy guitar ending that leaves you desperate for more ! this album is definately worth buying , do n't let your collection be without it
