great collection i still have the tape of this album . the record was released in 1986 , ngdb 's twentieth anniversary , and it includes a lot of their best songs , including three of my favorites , & quot ; mr. bojangles & quot ; , & quot ; ripplin ' waters & quot ; , and & quot ; partners , brothers and friends & quot ; . the one song on this album that had n't been previously released , & quot ; stand a little rain & quot ; , is also excellent . bob carpenter hardly ever sings lead on an ngdb song , but on & quot ; stand a little rain & quot ; , he does a fine job of singing . the reason i did n't give this record a higher rating is because one song on the album , & quot ; fire in the sky & quot ; , does n't sound country enough , in my opinion . true , the dirt band had a lot of pop , as well as country and folk , influences . however , i think & quot ; fire in the sky & quot ; , on which jeff hanna shares the lead vocals with kenny loggins , veers a little too far in the pop direction with its saxophone , although the arrangement is excellent . nevertheless , that 's a small shortcoming here . overall , twenty years of dirt is a great collection . ngdb fans should have this one
