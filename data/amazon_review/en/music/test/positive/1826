most bands would give their left arm for an album as good as this this 4th band album has gotten a bad rap over the years . only because the first 3 were so legendary . i tell you what , do yourself a favor and listen to this album again , i was amazed how good it really is . with songs like the river hymm , life is a carnival , moon struck one , shoot out in chinatown an dthe underrated volcano , it 's an album most bands would die for to make .
