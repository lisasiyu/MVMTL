magnificant animal farm is the best film score i have ever heard . it 's beautiful and haunting on so many levels . the songs really convey the emotion of the film ( which is really good , by the way ) beasts of the world is really reminiscent of the communist revolution . the theme storm of judgment resonates with the hope of the animals as well the darkness of napoleon 's reign . highly recommended
