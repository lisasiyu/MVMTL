beautiful music two long time friends together , reminiscing and playing absolutely beautiful blues and ballads . if & quot ; new orleans blues & quot ; or & quot ; stormy weather & quot ; do n't bring a tear to your eye , then you need to check with a doctor to see if you are still alive . why the amazon sales rank on this cd is so low is beyond my comprehension . wonderful recording quality . these recordings along with the other in this series are among lonnie johnson and elmer snowden 's finest -- amazing since both are considered to have peaked performance wise in the late 20s/early 30s
