three cheers for artistic bravery i grew up in the 80 's , during the heyday of great dramatic metal bands like iron maiden and queensryche . now that i 'm older ( and a professional musician myself with years of classical training ) , i can recognize the cheesiness of the bands that i loved when i was a kid . but i can still listen to a lot of that material and appreciate the musical and poetic ambition , the theatricality and the grandeur that the bands of that day were earnestly striving toward . i got `` three cheers for sweet revenge '' for free , and i probably would n't have even given it a listen if i had n't been so intrigued by the cover art ( which it turns out was done by the lead singer of my chemical romance ) . i 'm embarrassed to say that i just associated this band with legions of mindless teeny-bopper fans and i could n't even imagine liking their music . in retrospect , i see that that is an insult to the band and to its fans ( who are clearly on to something ) . it 's been a long time since i 've been excited about a rock band . the last five or six years have been discouraging ones for mature pop music fans . maybe it 's just me , but it seems like , in the wake of september 11th , 2001 , we 've been awash in nostalgia acts : the strokes , the white stripes , the killers , the scissor sisters , jet , gnarls barkley , franz ferdinand and the like . these are acts that deliberately attempt to evoke another era , not only with the sound and composition of their music , but also by the way they dress and even by their bands ' names . it 's true that pop music has always mined the past for inspiration , but these `` retro-parody '' acts , as i call them , shamelessly attempt to recreate a specific musical sound of an earlier time without bringing any stylistic innovation to the artistic process ; the music could easily be mistaken for material recorded 20 or 30 years ago . and while i actually like some of the work being produced by these bands , i feel that this approach represents the worst kind of artistic cowardice , for it allows the artist to hide behind a veneer of irony . like foam trucker hats , this kind of art mocks the style while copping the style at the same time . the artists puts nothing of himself into the art , and therefore risks nothing . in a day and age when real life seems dark and complicated , it 's easy to understand the appeal of retro-parody music ; it transports us to an imaginary time when life was simple , even simplistic , and when nonsensical music reflected that simple-minded aesthetic . the more i listen to `` three cheers for sweet revenge '' , the more i admire the sheer audacity of this record . the first time through , i could n't shut it off ; the album is a relentless attack of high-energy pop/punk , replete with rhythmic drive , wailing guitars , infectious hooks and lots of screaming . even so , i thought the album might be a bit much for me- a little over the top , a little too dramatic . but i was intrigued by the lyrics , which seemed to be trying to tell a story , so i went online and poked around and found out that `` three cheers '' is in fact a concept album that tells the story of a man who must kill 1,000 evil souls in order to be reunited with his lover . i also found an interview with the band where they explained that they intended `` three cheers '' to be completely dramatic , theatrical and totally over-the-top ; i 'd say they succeeded on all three counts . i realized that my chemical romance is a kind of anomaly in today 's pop music sphere . they represent the rare breed of artist who is willing to take a huge risk for the sake of making an original artistic statement . no one out there is doing anything remotely like this ; while mcr might sound stylistically similar to other bands out there , i think it 's pretty safe to say that this is the only band making big , dramatic , sincere concept albums ( in the line of `` operation : mindcrime '' and `` seventh son of a seventh son '' ) . i emphasize the word `` sincere '' because i think it 's hugely important to the mcr phenomenon . while retro-parody acts mimic and mock the style and dress of 70 's and 80 's bands for a cheap thrill and a quick buck , my chemical romance clearly recognize that the great music of those decades was written with sincere intentions , and this is manifest in mcr 's own music , which reflects the influence of their predecessors without ever sounding quite like any of them ( you 'd never mistake my chemical romance for an 80 's or even a 90 's band ) . the fact that my chemical romance is hugely popular among people half my age ( i 'm in my early 30 's ) almost turned me off to the band . but i 'm starting to realize that this kind of musical snobbery is self-defeating , and when it comes to pop music it may be that teenagers are sometimes more likely to recognize a good thing . pop music critics , most of whom are my age or older , naturally fawn over the retro-parody acts , as these bands validate , by obsequious imitation , the music of the critics ' own youth . but while the critics live in the past , i 'm not surprised that mcr , whose lyrics sincerely and directly reflect the moral ambiguities of our own troubled times , have found many loyal young fans . when you think about what this band is attempting on `` three cheers for sweet revenge '' , it 's actually pretty amazing that they pull it off . it would have been less surprising to see a band with this kind of grand artistic ambition simply fall flat , getting bogged down in solipsistic lyrics and ornate , melancholy music . but that does n't happen here , because these guys have the talent , the wit , and the chops to make it happen . the music , in fact , is probably the most surprising thing happening here . forgetting for a moment the concept , the hype , the theatricality and all the rest , no one can dispute the fact that there is a high degree of musical talent at work on this album . sure , the songs are basically formulaic- most good pop music is . but the songwriting is solid , accomplished and unique . the single `` im not okay '' , for instance , with its carefully-plotted and infectious vocal line , could almost have been ghost-written by a professional songwriter ; but the quirky lyrics mark it as unmistakably original , an irresistable anthem for a new generation . it 's easy to lose sight of mcr 's strong compositional skill under all the screaming and the eyeliner , etc. , but , to me , that makes it all the more admirable- the fact that the musical artistry of this band is never thrust in your face as something to be admired ; it 's just quietly at work , the motor driving this mad machine . not only are the songs remarkably well-crafted , but the execution of the songs is impressive , too . the sound of the band is incredibly tight , with dual guitars dominating the music texture . the lead singer does a lot of screaming , but also a lot of really excellent singing . he has a semi-obnoxious , but clear and strident voice , and a pretty wide vocal range . forceful and propulsive , the album is pretty much a shot of musical adrenaline from start to finish , with a short interlude ( track # 8 ) that works to break up the texture a little bit . the only thing that prevented me from giving this album a full five-star review is the fact that tracks # 11 & # 12 tend to lag a bit , not in musical energy , but simply in content ; they seem somehow like slightly meandering , b-level songs that might 've been cut if the album were longer . but track # 13 brings the record to a satisfying conclusion . my chemical romance is a genuinely talented , skilled and honest band making an all-out attempt to deliver bold , artistic statements with each album ; for this , i think they should be commended . whether or not you like their music is entirely up to you , and i do n't think a distaste for this type of adventurous stuff necessarily reflects badly upon the individual listener- just give mcr props for being artistically courageous
