barbara cook i have pretty well all of her cd 's and dvd 's so this extra one from her concert at carnegie hall this year was especially welcome . her voice is still terrific - some of the songs she sings bring tears to your eyes and others fill you with joy . this is an album to treasure and hear again and again . thank you barbara !
