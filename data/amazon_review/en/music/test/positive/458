the rock gods smile if you play this cd in reverse it says `` jesus is satan . '' comets on fire are dense . blue cathedral was a punishing wall of noise . listening to it i felt like one of those explorers in the black and white tarzan movies equipped with a machete inching through the foliage . however , once you carved out your own path the album rewarded you tenfold . comets are unapologetically classic rock , but instead of just breaking out the old hendrix and painting by numbers they added some proto-punk and an echoplex . some thought blue cathedral was more attitude than it was songwriting , and to them avatar is the perfect rebuttal . here the faces riffs and robert plant vocals are slowed down to further reveal the songs to the point where someone who hated blue cathedral might actually like avatar . do n't worry , there 's still use of the echoplex , and the songs are drawn from six to eight minutes in length ( with one exception ) , but comets have traded in some of their feral energy for a more dynamic sound . benefiting the most from the new dynamics is the bad acid sounding `` lucifer 's memory , '' a song that sounds like a flower wilting . there 's a certain cadence that plugs along with the chugging vocals pushing the song towards its seven minute mark . it has quickly become my favorite new song of this year . while there are still some rockers , such as the opener `` dogwood rust '' which sounds as if its beginning should be found somewhere before you pressed play , just as the closer sounds as if it ends before the song has stopped , even these rockers sound less brutal than their predecessors . only `` holy teeth '' has the same long-haired head banging attitude as blue cathedral , and it only lasts three minutes ( only a minute in comets on fire time ) . at almost nine-minutes `` soup smoke '' pushes the limits of pseudo-tribal beats . instead of punishing noise comets are pounding repetition into our heads . just thirteen more seconds and i think i would have had a spiritual vision . at only six minutes long the closer `` hatched upon the age '' proves that it takes more than just length to be epic and more than just noise for a crescendo . the miracle of the album is that through all of the interplay between the instruments sometimes it 's just a couple of simple repetitive piano keys to bring it all home . avatar is easily one of the best releases of '06 . very few bands can bring me back to that feeling i got discovering classic rock bands in middle school . but do n't break out your eight tracks and dust off the old bong yet . unlike most bands , retro is only half of the story for comets on fire . comets on fire are ultimately timeless . try as i might , i can not lump them with all the other seventies rockers , but their sound hardly seems contemporary . it 's as if they 've found some time wormhole so they can rock on across the ages . i 'm there , man , i 'm there
