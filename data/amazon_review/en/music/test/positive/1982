first dgg album -- very promising anna netrebko has rapidly become a first tier star in opera . this album , her first at dgg , illustrates why some rate her so highly ; it also illustrates some of the questions that some have raised about her . all in all , though , a very nice cd . a few selections illustrate : mozart , idomeneo , `` quando avran fine omai . '' she displays a rich and clean voice . there is a very attractive quality to her voice manifest in this work . mozart , don giovanni , `` crudele ? ah no , mio bene ! ... non mi dir . '' this is donna anna 's poignant aria , given her circumstances . netrebko displays rich tones . this is a well sung cut . `` non mi dir '' shows off some agility in her voice . donizetti , lucia di lammermoor . `` ancor non giunse ! . . .regnava nel silenzio . . .quando rapito in estasi '' something of a disappointment . coloratura is not her forte ( and see her `` sempre libera '' cd for further confirmation ) . she clearly shows off a rich and lush voice . i think that she displays some characterization here that is compelling . she hits high notes cleanly . but her ornamentation is indifferent , and she appears unable to trill . i know , some say that that is irrelevant . but compare beverly sills ' version of this work , with almost too many trills extraordinarily well sung and her florid technique , and this version simply pales . bellini , la sonnambula . `` care compagna . . .come per me sereno . '' again , netrebko displays a rich voice . she displays an agile voice and the ability to hit the high notes . her rendition of `` come per sereno '' is spirited . gounod , faust . `` the jewel song . '' very smooth singing ; animated singing . but the technique does not measure up to anna moffo 's version -- let alone joan sutherland 's . puccini , la boheme . `` musetta 's waltz . '' yikes ! what a version . brava netrebko . her darker voice is very well suited to this . the characterization of musetta seems on the mark . a wonderful cut . all in all , this shows the promise of netrebko . it also indicates where her strengths are and where she does not do so well ( coloratura work ) . however , this is a very nice introduction to her work and her art .
