... and 1/2 ... .strong rhythmic intensity , catchy lyrics & just plain ol ' fun rowdiness playing time - 38:26 -- if you know what 's best for you on a saturday night , then you 'll pick up a copy of `` horseshoes & hand grenades , '' for a driving set of summar 's rockin ' country music . actually , he calls it `` farm rock , '' a convergence of chuck berry and george jones . full of grit , trent incorporates strong rhythmic intensity as the foundation for his striking stories and just plain ol ' fun rowdiness . the elements all lend perfectly to our listening amusement . they hit the ground with a steady gallop from the first song to the last , even with the brief eccentric punk/grunge moments in `` he stopped loving her today '' that will either get you frowning or smiling depending on how open-minded you are to the boys having a little fun with the country classic . i have n't heard the album that trent put out in 2000 ( or his 1994 `` hank flamingo '' release ) , but understand that it brought plenty of airplay , gig and tour offers ... even landed him a showcase on the grand ole opry . produced by rand bishop , `` horseshoes & hand grenades '' further indulges us with some eclectic alt-country instrumentalists and background vocalists . remember the ozark mountain daredevils with their blend of country rock , bluegrass , and southern boogie ? bassman/vocalist michael `` supe '' granda was a founding member of that group . and the 1980s atlanta-based georgia satellites with their stones-like guitar grunge ? guitarist/vocalist dan baird was a key member of that enjoyable band . steel guitarist gary morse is a regular with brooks & dunn . other experienced musicians in the new row mob include dave kennedy ( drums ) , ken mcmahan ( guitar ) , and a host of others who appear to a lesser degree on the cd . mike webb 's piano and b-3 organ are noteworthy . besides those collaborations with other nashville-based writers , a number of the musicians on the album co-wrote many of these songs with summar . and you may have already heard some of the songs covered by others like billy currington ( `` she knows what to do with a saturday night '' ) , gary allan ( `` guys like me '' ) , and jack ingram ( `` love you '' ) . that 's a feather is summar 's cap for other up-and-coming singers to acknowledge the sturdiness of trent 's material . without being too disparaging , i found the similarity of the beat in a few of the songs to create a modicum of banality . but , for the most part , the set progresses as a successful , raucous journey from beginning to end . reminiscent of the bakersfield sound , the country rock-infused groove and clever lines convey some deliriously fun messages . some other catchy hooks , and even some rustic bluegrass flavorings , are found in songs like `` hayride , '' `` pink john deere , '' and `` girl from tennessee . '' hitting you like an express train , `` louisiana nashville line '' is full of steam . in `` guys like me , '' trent sings `` it 's hard to find a place to play my guitar , they 're trying to put an end to guys like me . '' i 'd say this album will fetch him plenty of fame and gigs . trent 's well on his way to landing his golden dreams on solid ground . ( joe ross , roseburg , or . )
