for what it 's worth what a combination ! releasing a soundtrack that would pit traditional southern critics of bluegrass against rabid white stripes fans from detroit ! i 'm sure that jack white is n't the only performer who is delighted with the controversy this album generated . musicians just love the music ... ... it 's the critics who need to take a hike . this is a great album that showcases both great traditional bluegrass and well known rock musicians displaying a love of the human feeling that is embodied in bluegrass . so ... ..quitcherbitchin and enjoy it for what it is ... ..a nice soundtrack to a movie that showcases bluegrass for a wide popular audience
