oh me , oh my ! dylan goes country and he does it well . this is a record far too short . good songs here , but not enough of them . it seems like you 've just put the cd in the player and it 's over . but other than the fact that there is n't as much music here as on a normal dylan cd , i have no complaints . dylan is in fine voice here , sort of a country , high pitched twang that works very nicely . he tells these songs of love and loss with such sincerity , such honesty . but then he attacks everything he does that way , so it should be no surprise . this is just a wonderful , if a bit too short , record
