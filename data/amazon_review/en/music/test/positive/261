fun and catchy ! people , honestly , who cares if franz ferdinand is today 's best band or if this album is `` funky '' or not . this album is just good ol ' fun music that 's not at all watered down or lackluster . just listen to this album and dance to it . not every critical acclaimed album has to be a masterpiece .
