one rare and great cd i just love it . it 's my second villegas after cafe ole and i like it better than the first one . vocals are intriguing - they lack the professional training and quality and that is what makes them refreshing . i consider it money well spent . i do n't have musical training - i am a non-latino male who is into latin music
