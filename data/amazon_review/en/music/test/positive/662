lived up to my expectations ! i recently saw we are scientists open for the arctic monkeys at the granada in dallas and my , were they good ! usually , opening acts are disregarded , and we are scientists were n't taken with interest at first , but after just a song , everyone was singing and dancing . they are friendly guys ( i met keith after the show with my friends ) with humorous personalities and clever bander and their lyrics , while simple at times , still make an impact amongst catchy and well-executed instrumentation .
