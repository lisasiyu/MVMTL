one of alan jackson 's best cds i am a big fan of alan jackson , and & quot ; who i am & quot ; is , in my opinion , his best cd . there are two excellent re-makes of earlier songs on this cd , & quot ; summertime blues & quot ; and & quot ; thank god for the radio & quot ; , and they are both very good . i especially like jackson 's guitar playing on & quot ; summertime blues & quot ; . this cd spawned several other hits as well , such as & quot ; livin ' on love & quot ; , & quot ; gone country & quot ; , & quot ; i do n't even know your name & quot ; , and the title track . all songs on this cd are typical jackson : great ballads intermixed with some fun , up-tempo songs . this disc has a little bit for everybody . country fans are sure to enjoy this fine cd from alan jackson
