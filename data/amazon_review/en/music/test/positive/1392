five stars does not do this art justice . from where metheny and his group members , ( of a common soul , i 'd almost swear , playing different tools from the same heart with different fingers ) take me and took european audiences on this album , i would have titled it `` levitation . '' music , well composed and performed , built and played with care , love , creativity and talent , takes me places that approach ecstatic . with this work on the audiograph i am transported places very few other musicians have ever taken me close to , in any genre . i can only compare it to feeling lifted up and floating , being held aloft -- levitated -- by pat 's group , working together so tightly while flowing , like liquid , over and through the songs ' melodies , arrangements , rhythms . listening , right now , to this cd 's version of the metheny-mays standard `` first circle . '' am in the clouds ! think it 's just my opinion ? listen to the crowd ! damn ! those big , blocky mays chords . buy the album . put it in a car 's player . turn it up ! ! ! you will thank me . you will thank those 6 guys . you wo n't want to get where you 're going . le
