sizzla kalonji i am a bonified sizzla fan and i love this album because he dared to do something different . it shows his versatility as an artist and shows all that bobo asante 's have big beautiful hearts . i m in love with `` show me '' and `` love you more '' my son loves `` be strong '' and `` nothing bothers me '' . this is a feel good album and i just hope sizzla stays unchanged since signing with dame dash music group
