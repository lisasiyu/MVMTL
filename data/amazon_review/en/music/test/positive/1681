in the beginning ... as a fan of the band waaaaaay back when i was in 10th grade ( 1980 ) , i 'm writing this review as the band experiences its renaissence ahead of its 30th anniversary world tour . most will likely focus on the final recording `` synchronicity '' . i prefer to start at the beginning . outlandos d'amour landed quietly in the us as the second wave of punk-infuenced british bands began their invasion . it 's hard to remember , but the police were contemporaries of elvis costello , the sex pistols , buzzcocks , ramones , and the jam , and this album was released stateside at a time when led zeppelin , pink floyd , and the who were the reigning kings of british rock . no one knew it , but everything in music was about to change . in contrast to the hyper-produced operatic sounds of mainstream fm `` aor '' hard rock , the police were a spare , stripped-down , reggae-influence trio made up of a frenetic american drummer , and two brits - both jazz afficionados . their sound captured the energy of the emerging punk scene , but if their arrangement seemed simple it was so only to let the elegant simplicity of their songcraft shine through . amidst the roar of british arena rock , the police landed in america , playing small clubs like nyc 's now defunct cbgb , to even smaller audiences . and while this was going on , like a hushed whisper -- a single song began climbing american radio charts . a plaintive , tragic tale of a boy 's idealistic love for a prostitute . that song eventually became one of rock music 's most instantly recognized classics : roxanne . with that one song , the police pried open the american radio audience and made way for the eventual torrent that became `` new wave '' . as such , the band , and their debut album deserve recognition as a defining influence on the landscape of modern music , every bit as much as nirvana or the beatle 's for their seminal works . there are few other memorable songs here that anyone other than an ardent fan would appreciate . other than roxanne , only the tongue-in-cheek , suicidal break-up song `` ca n't stand losing you '' ever made it into the us charts . still , the album flows pleasantly from start to finish , and the final cut `` mosoka tanga '' , with its unintelligible lyrics , sets the listener up stylistically for the sophomore release ( regatta de blanc ) that eventually cemented the bands ' now legendary success .
