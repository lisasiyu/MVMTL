aaaaaahhhh ! thanks vicki , for being obedient . you recorded some songs that i had heard of ( he 's been faithful , in the presence ) . i was n't prepared for your record to be solidly a blessing . do n't take that as an insult , but i was tempted to only listen to those songs , but i said `` christian , you need to just listen to the cd . '' from the start , it tells me the direction of the record , and it 's an awesome dedication to the lord '' it gives me tools to worship with , thanks for staying in the industry and minsitering . also , your child is cute
