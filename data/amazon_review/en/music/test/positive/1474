phenomenal ! well , i completely disagree with the negative review below , and i have a feeling that the gentleman who wrote it , who claims to be a mediocre picker of several instruments , will remain mediocre for his entire life . fiddle and violin are not the same thing . as the old joke goes , the difference between the two is that you should n't spill beer on a violin . to expect rural and traditional black fiddlers from the depression to play fiddle like classically trained modern fiddlers like mark o'connor or allison krauss is like expecting your country grandma to make hazelnut-crusted filet of chilean seabass with a pomegranate and wasabi reduction for sunday dinner , instead of pot roast and mashed potatoes . it 's an absurd expectation . this is the music of real people . many of these musicians undoubtedly farmed or did other backbreaking labor all week , taking their only joy from the music they 'd play on the weekend . their faithful listeners were in the same boat . remember that for many of these recordings , the concept of `` jazz '' had n't been invented yet . bluegrass , for that matter , would n't be invented for a couple more decades . anyone with a genuine appreciation for american traditional and folk music will love this album . yes , some of the recording quality is a little bit rough ( many of the songs sound like they 're playing on an old turntable instead of on a cd ) , but it 's completely listenable , not nearly as difficult to listen to as many other re-released gems from this era . listen to it with an open mind , and after you 've heard the first few tunes , your brain will automatically tune out the static ( which is minimal to begin with ) . this album is one of the more brilliant re-releases and collections from this era . get an idea of what real people were listening to and playing in this time period . you 'll thank yourself for giving it a try
