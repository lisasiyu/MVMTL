psychedelic punk you can dance to..it may sound better now than it did in 1967 . the fast spontaneous furious speed of this 1st album from the seminal improvisational band is nothing less than a spectacular experience far ahead of it 's time . the dead were fine musicians , always respected and paid homage to their influences by developing a unique hybrid of traditional blues and country , folk , jug and rock and roll within in a jazz setting . creating a new form emulated by so many of their contemporaries within rock may not have been their intention , but that is a defining element of their historical importance . the sense of immediacy and existential now is keenly felt here . even the few tracks clocked in at 5 minutes or higher have a primal energy to it and is danceable..the beauty of this album is that it totally debunks the notion that the dead were a jam band only and were not capable of laying down great songs in time spans under 3 minutes.they knew how to have a good time.. this cd features so many in concert staples later stretched out into what became dead head music listening to it again with the extra tracks and hdcd is very refreshing . the homage paid to their wide musical roots and upping it by creating dynamic interesting music interplaying in 1967 double guitars and later a dual drum attack into some unique synthesis that is both old and new was and is a rare accomplishment .
