indie masterpiece there is no doubt that i would rate this as one of the best abums of the 80 's and sonic youth 's best abum . however , if you are not a sonic youth fan already , i would steer you to their olater albums first . this album is very atmosphereic . it changes moods from mellow and pensive to raging guitar riffs . it has an almost purposeful low-fi sound ( think of early albums from dinosaur jr. or guided by voices ) . if you are not into experimental , indie rock , go to sonic youth 's later albums like `` goo '' or `` dirty '' . they are more accessible . ( i wouldnt say that they compromise integrity though ) however , if you are a music explorer ; someone who likes bands like radiohead , there is a reason that sonic youth are considered the godfathers ( with apologies to kim gordon , the female bassist ) of underground music . i defy you to talk to a person who loves indie rock who does not love this band , and particularly this album .
