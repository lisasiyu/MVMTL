stunning ... sheer intangible musical brilliance i bought this album because of the opening track , `` the hollow , '' which , after listening to it online , i felt as if it was the most incredibly melodic rock song i 've heard in a long time . i also thought maynard 's voice sounded absolutely amazing on that song . so i went out a bought the album about an hour ago , literally ! every song is amazing ! even though many of the songs are heavy , they have this highly ambient melodic feel to them , especially with billy howerdel 's and troy van leeuwen 's guitar playing , which really shine all the way through on the album . they use some very interesting guitar effects for virtually every song . in any event , whether you are a fan of tool or not , a fan of maynard 's or not , buy this album ! i 'll admit , i 'm a fan of tool , no doubt , especially the albums `` aenima , '' and `` lateralus , '' which both have some of the most incredible progressive metal music on them , but i almost like this band better . i like the fact that apc is just about as heavy as tool , more melodic , have a more polished sound , are more experimental and progressive ( in my opinion ) than most of what i 've heard from tool . this is not to discredit tool 's work , of course , whose music has already been etched in the alms of metal and hard rock history , it is just to say that apc is another alternative . whether or not this is a `` side project '' of maynard 's or not , it does not matter to me , the band and album is flipping amazing in every which way ! favorite songs : `` the hollow , '' `` orestes , '' and `` 3 libras '' .
