gorgeous bill evans is a musician you never tire of listening to . he has the ability to play a tune freshly , every time . this recording is , in my opinion , his finest . the first date after the untimely death of scott lafaro , this album is beautiful , melodic and haunting . every tune is played with typical evans genius , but on this session he seems to be expressing his musical ideas with even more flavor and emotion . the first cut is the most expressive and emotive i have ever heard in the trio setting . i am sure it was dedicated to lafaro , even though it supposedly is an anagram for the producer of the date , orrin keepnews . evans expresses his passion , joy and grief for his young bassist in every note and the result is , to my mind , stunning . i love chuck israels ' bass lines and the chords evans plays quietly over the bass solo are beautiful and ephemeral . every tune on this cd is wonderful , the playing of everyone is at such a high level of creativity that this music will live on forever . this is a ca n't miss choice if you like piano music
