the title track alone merits 5 stars milestones is a transitional recording . sandwiched betweeen round about midnight and kind of blue , it features miles with coltrane and cannonball just before miles ' move to a pure modal approach on kind of blue . for me the title tune is a stunner and it has become something of a jazz anthem for good reason . the contrast between adderly 's melodic playing , coltrane 's harsher approach and the perfectly understated trumpet of miles davis is one of those moments in musical history that make you shake your head in wonder . the treatment given monk 's straight no chaser is fantastic . this is right up there as one of my favorite miles recordings
