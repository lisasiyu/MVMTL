quincy , i never had it so damn good ! just listen to the piece , ''love , i never had it so good '' and tell me that this does n't move you . this is the most creative piece of work i have ever listened to . i had an employee of a vinyl record store play this album and even he was moved by that song . luther vandross sounds so young on ''sounds ... . '' he really does sounds a bit different than on his later recordings . vandross comes across as fresh and more soulful back then than he ever did in his 80 's recordings . ''love me by name '' is just wonderful and i dig the black choir that comes in to accompany patti austin . i have heard other jones ' production but this one takes the cake . it is the best one i have heard . ''tell me a bedtime story '' moves the hell out of me . i am not jiving yall . please buy this record ! ! you ca n't go wrong with chaka khan , ashford and simpson , luther vandross , herbie hancock , patti austin , and gwen gutherie coming together to make a really prolific album .
