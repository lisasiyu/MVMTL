heres how to meet the beatles ... .. if not for `` the blue album '' i would have probably never became a fan of the beatles . back in the day-day they had virtually no influence on me whatsoever . i knew many a song from the old days of beatle-mania , i wan na hold your hand type of stuff . i was n't terribly impressed . than one day i was introduced to sgt . pepper and abbey road thru a friend , and i realized that there actually was a reason why the beatles are so legendary . in my book the years 1967-1970 are the better beatle years . more experimental , less poppish , and more ... . waaaaaaaavy maaaaaan . more rockin ' to say the least . the red and blue albums are perfect starter packs for the beatles . someone managed to pick just the right songs to put on both collections . ( red is for the beatle-maniacs , and blue is for the acid eating beatle-maniacs ) both were mixed just right . sure you do n't get everything , but there is far too much to ask for . you get the full versions of the stuff that you are bound to know , and if not will take to quickly and both sets are quality hits packages . i remember when i was around 14 and decided i was gon na get myself a beatles record . i was n't sure exactly what i wanted at first.. but one look at the track list on here , and i knew i wanted this one . i chose correctly . the best beatles hits pack available .
