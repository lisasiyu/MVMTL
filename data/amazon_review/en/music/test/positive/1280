lost pastoral serendity ... forest is a low-key folk group that is in line with incredible string band , but in my opinion , they are even better . this 2 cd package is a very wise buy as it 's full of wonderful and amazing music . 3 guys are all talented multi-instrumentalists and their compositions sounds like the renaisance folk songs ! very beautiful , fantasy , dreams , love themes incorporated seamlessly in this package . best cuts : graveyard ( cd 2 ) , bad penny ( opening track of cd 1 ) ... etc . in general cd 1 is even better , of course , both cd is fresh and never boring
