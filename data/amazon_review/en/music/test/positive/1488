good album this ablum contains all of the germ 's singles and their only studio album . this is an incredible punk album and belongs in your album collection if you 're a fan of punk . everything in the cd is perfect except the fact the sex boy has horrible sound quality ( but whats funny is that on the last page of the booklet it says ''we make no apologies for the sound quality of any of these recordings ) but its quite funny to hear the choas that is going on while they perform . i highly recommend this collection of recordings
