a magnificent cd from one of the best groups proably one of the best cd queen has did since , a night at opera . that and also knowing the fact that this would be queen 's last cd together . i mean , words ca n't begin to describe how good this cd is . inneundo is like one musical painting . with songs like `` deliah , bijou '' and the title track itself , `` innuendo '' that just inspire the imagination and the soul . but , it also has some very moving tracks too , `` the show must go on '' and `` these are the days of our lives '' . that are so wonderful . innuendo is a great cd and is most defantly worth listening to .
