this is a very good c.w . album but not the best this is one of the better albums of c.w.mccall 's tunes . i 've been looking for years for a copy of the wolf creek pass album . i have it on a worn out 8-track and ca n't seem to locate it anywhere else . with songs like nite rider , old sloan , classified , 4-wheel drive , old thirty and more . this one will serve as a substitute till i can find one
