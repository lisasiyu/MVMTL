highly enjoyable i am not a big tesla fan but this is a great album . i think what hurt them is that they were categorized with the all the goofy hair metal bands but they were more in the vein of your classic 70 's style rock and roll band . this live album , along with the accoustic format , helped to distinguish tesla from the hair metal bands of the era . tesla did not do much after this cd so this acts as an excellent greatest hits compilation as well . besides their own work , the covers are good and interesting selections . they do not just play `` truckin '' , rather they segue into it . `` lodi '' is done very well and then the song that essentially launched the cd , as well as the band , is `` signs '' . they take this marginal 60 's era protest song and put their stamp of it . it still maintains a protest aura to it but the accoustic treatment makes it grittier and it rocks out harder . tesla made the song their own ! as far as the accoustic format , the song `` love song '' showcases the musicianship of the band . i like how they could not resist plugging in for the guitar solo . overall , you do not have to be a fan of this band to enjoy this cd . if you like any classic rock led zep , ccr , thin lizzy , deep purple , aerosmith etc . then you will like this . like i said , i am not a big fan but b/c of this cd , i would see them live any day !
