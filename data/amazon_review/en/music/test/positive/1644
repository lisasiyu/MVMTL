very satisfying with so many tracks , spanning both the first and second seasons of the new doctor who series , this american listener found this soundtrack very satisfying , because it captures all those highlights and moods i loved so much from the show . all those little songs moments that you wished you could hear more of . i highly recommend it for anyone that enjoyed the show
