onj at her best wow , what a trip back in time ! as i listen to this album , i am immediately transported back to my brother 's car , listening to olivia scream like a banshee on `` please do n't keep me waiting '' . certainly , the cover art , along with the release of `` grease '' earlier that same year ( 1978 ) , made an impression on my 13-year old mind - but now that i 'm a mellower , 41 year old , i still am astounded by the quality of this album . great music , track after track . my personal favorites are `` please do n't keep me waiting '' , `` borrowed time '' , `` dancing round and round '' , and `` boats against the current '' . as for `` boats '' , eric carmen should be very pleased with the fine treatment that olivia gave this beautiful song of his . sadly , as of my writing this in nov , 2006 , the cd is still only available as an import - what a miscarriage of justice ! anyway , it 's worth the effort to secure a copy - thanks to amazon for making it available
