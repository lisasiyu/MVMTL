i enjoy it more than my son i purchased this cd for the daily car trips around town when my son is with me . most every track has characters talking , giving intros to the letters and such . all very cute , very seasame street - and 100 % a stroll down memory lane . i 'm not sure if it 's all in mono , but most of the songs are from way way back - probably 70 's and 80 's . i get a kick out of it because it 's nostalgic ; and my son enjoys it because he gets to sing along and learn the alphabet
