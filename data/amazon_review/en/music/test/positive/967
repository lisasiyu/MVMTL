great to answer the reviewer below , i have listened to this cd five times already . it still rules . what does the `` test of time '' mean ? you can pretty well forget how this album sounds like and be amazed by it ten years later . one listen could be well enough as well . it 's great , that 's all . it 's not a usual collection of songs , it 's something else - for the better . i have a lot of records in my collection , and for a change , i 'm really happy to own something different . at least *this* record is unique in its own way . also , it 's one of the best tributes to american roots , and especially to the beat generation , that i 've ever heard . musically and spiritually . this record is the work of an artist and of a human person willing to express something in the best way possible . got it
