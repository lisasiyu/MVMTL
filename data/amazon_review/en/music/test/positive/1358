from rags to beautiful songs tisha campbell is a underrated actress with a big beautiful singing voice . while america gives these bitches like ashanti , britney , hilary and lindsay the limelight and pass on tisha ! not right yall ! every song on this album is slamming . capitol should have done a better job promoting this wonderful album . `` push '' is a funky track which enlisted the help of tichina arnold on backgrounds . `` all good things come in time '' is a quiet storm classic song . `` brokenhearted '' is a slice of perfect pitch heaven . `` love 's got a hold on me '' is a sexy slow number that captivates any ole heart . so in parting , the next time somebody complains about not any real singers , cop this album . how does america think that britney , ashanti , hillary and lindsay have vocal talents ? i have britney & ashanti . these girls need to go to vocal camp and learn a thing or two from ms. campbell martin . these girls could n't hold a candle next to tisha 's four octaves . think about that , the next time yall complain about no talent girls
