cry of love back in the 70 's i wore out my vinyl copy of hendrix 's cry of love album . songs like , drifting and my friend have been floating around in my head for all these years and i had tried to find a copy of cry of love on cd several times with no luck . well , here it is under a different name and with some additional songs ! these are some of the best cuts jimi hendrix ever recorded and the music sounds as good today as it did when i was a kid . absolutely great stuff .
