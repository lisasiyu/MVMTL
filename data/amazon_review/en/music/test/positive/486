hidden in plain view delivers a stellar debut ! the new album `` life in dreaming '' is a spectacular debut from hidden in plain view . definitely one of the best albums of 2005 so far and will probably be in the top 10 of the year . the album is full of catchy hooks , tight riffs , double bass , and the singing is excellent . every song is full of emotion and you can really see some talent in this young band . i would say they sound like a mix between taking back sunday and senses fail . i admit that this album is n't anything new to the scene and they 're very emoish but i think hipv will definitely make a dint in this already overcrowded scene . my only complaint is that the new version of `` twenty below '' is n't as good as it was on their ep , but it 's still good . hipv do n't really bring nething new to the table but their music is heartfelt and is a solid emo/punk record . definitely worth your money .
