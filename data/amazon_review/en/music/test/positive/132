an open book loreena mckennitt 's music will evoke other artists such as enya and kate bush ( when she 's in full celtic mode ) . mckennitt seems a bit more earnest in her seeker stance , and there 's nothing wrong with that . it does probably mean that she may not reach everyone , especially those listeners who are less of a mystical bent . there is precious little irony or skepticism here , so it pretty much helps to be on the same spiritual page as the artist herself . or at least to be able to temporarily to suspend your lack of belief . i did after a few listens , and i found myself coming back for more . new age music has its own kind of `` hooks , '' and it is unlikely that once having heard the exotic arrangements here that you will be able to get them out of your head very easily . her european hit `` the mummer 's dance '' is particularly haunting . unlike some of the reviewers below , i have to recommend this album with a few caveats . it may be hard for fans to realize that this really wo n't be everyone 's cup of herbal tea . but then what is ? although i can think of one or two people i would n't bother playing this for , if you like your music romantic ( in the original sense of the word ) and your lyrics appropriately diaphonous , well , you ca n't do better than loreena mckennitt .
