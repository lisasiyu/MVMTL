my newest obsession i 'm not particularly interested in punk music , i prefer roots/americana/folk and on the other hand 70 's and 80 's rock music . i , like so many others , heard dropkick 's song on `` the departed '' and it 's gripping sound drew me in to purchase the album . i am now 100 % certain that i will sooner or later end up with every album in their catalog . to tell you the truth , i 've abandoned the other 1,000 songs on my ipod for 13 of the 14 tracks on this album . the songs are anthem-like , brawl-inspiring , rugby-esque . music that goes well with a side of raw meat . i am glad i bought this album before the earlier ones , it 's mature and established sound helped hook me . i ca n't wait ( now ) to get into the grittier earlier tunes
