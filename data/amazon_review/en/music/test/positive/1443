great idea , masterfully pulled off avantasia , the metal opera - where to begin ? a slew of famous power metal vocalists , top-notch instrumentation , and exciting fantasy-inspired lyrics combine to give us the first half of a two-part story created by edguy frontman tobias sammet . note : it is an opera in the sense that each role is performed by a different vocalist . best tracks are avantasia , sign of the cross , glory of rome , the tower , and serpents in paradise . the instrumental tracks are well-done and do n't hurt the story . malleus maleficarum is creepy but adds to the story . inside is the one track you can skip - luckily , it 's only two minutes long
