best song cycle ever written ! i believe that this is the best song cycle ever written and remains as one of my favourite guettel pieces . the songs on this cd are extraordinary , extremely well written and cleverly assembled . i have also bought the sheet music which confirms his musical genius even further and also contains many songs not on the cd such as prometheus , jesus the might conquerer , life is but a dream and build a bridge , all of which are fabulous . this is a must for all music lovers ! you wo n't regret it
