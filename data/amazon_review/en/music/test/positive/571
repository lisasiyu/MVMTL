fabuloushardcore my brother saw hopesfall perform one of their first shows back in 1999 . he told me about how amazing they were , so i tracked down frailty of words and bought it online . i had all but stopped listening to hardcore before the first night i listened to the dts release . just like a lot of independent music , my first listen was a confused and almost disappointing one . but then i listened to it again . now , nearly five years later , this is still my favorite cd of all time . i listen to all kinds of music too . i 'm not a die hard metalcore/hardcore fan by any stretch of the imagination . these guys are blessed . even though the original members have all gone their seperate ways for the most part , i still support and buy every album that this band comes out with . now , let me get to no wings to speak of . just as enjoyable as their first album , and slightly more progressive . if you want to here some outstanding music , buy this ep . trust me , for fans of hardcore , this is cutting edge pure emotion spilled out over sound waves . it will change your perception forever . everyone rants about end of an era . it 's absolutely 100 % as good as people say , but every song on here is equally impressive . this is the fullest sounding , most emotionally driven , heart pounding , deep and intense music i 've heard maybe ever . if you do n't buy this cd , you are cheating yourself big time . if you like hopesfall , i strongly recommend 7angels 7plagues , misery signals , evergreen terrace , between the buried and me , prayer for cleansing . all these bands deliver much passionate hardcore , but you just ca n't compare them to hopesfall . they are in a leauge all their own . and just one more thing . what is it about north carolina that so many of these awesome bands come from there ? i dunno
