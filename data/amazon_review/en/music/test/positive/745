dylan 's second album masterpiece after careful consideration this was the dylan album i chose to buy . and i do not regret buying it nor should anyone . this is a masterpiece . not many people can make an album that holds you from track 1 to the end . the beatles , tom petty , and bob dylan all can keep you sittin ' on the edge of your seat . great timeless songs on here are of course blowin ' in the wind a song that breaks generation barriers . the lovely girl from north country , bob dylans bob dylan 's blues , masters of war , and many more . without a doubt a must have in any dylan collection . your not a dylan fan if you do n't have this
