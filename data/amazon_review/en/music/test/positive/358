the very best of meatloaf i 've been a fan of meatloaf since his album `` bat of hell '' . i like the dramatic use of orchestral and backgound vocals . i think that meatloft 's voice is so powerful , and these songs prove that . this is by far the best album of meatloaf 's performances . this album along with `` bat out of hell '' , and `` bat out of hell ii '' is all that you need for your collection of meatloaf . this is a great career retrospective album
