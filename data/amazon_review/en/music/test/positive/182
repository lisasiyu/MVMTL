funk is on the rise ! i have been reading some of the reviews online for this cd and i am wondering for the p-funk haters with the state of black music on the radio what do you people expect ? i like this double cd because george was going for the old & new sound of today 's overproduced and water down sound.the songs i really liked were `` bounce 2 this '' a funk jam for the ages , '' inhale slow '' , '' never ending love '' , '' su , su , su '' , '' something stank '' , '' viagra '' , '' paradigm '' , '' gyspy woman '' , '' whole lotta shakin '' , and `` goodnight sweetheart , goodnight '' .there were some songs i did n't care for songs like `` i can dance '' which went on for too long and `` butt-a-butt '' .i wish mr. clinton would brought some of his trademark characters to this cd : sir nose , starchild , dr.funkenstein , the monkey , the horny horns , etc.in short , this is a very good album better than the pervious p-funk albums in the 90's.this cd is a good start
