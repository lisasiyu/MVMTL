brent mydland 's finest hour i think `` in the dark '' is the best studio disc the band did with keyboardist brent mydland . he sounded tentative in his singing on `` go to heaven , '' and i do n't think his songs on that album stand up to his contributions here , especially `` tons of steel . '' in fact , the three major writers -- mydland , bob weir and jerry garcia , with their respective lyricist partners -- all acquit themselves well on this disc . garcia 's `` touch of grey '' and `` black muddy river '' are his strongest tunes in years ; you have to go back to the better parts of the `` terrapin '' suite to find anything as significant from him . weir 's `` hell in a bucket '' and the outtake `` my brother esau '' have a gritty , churning resonance . as some have pointed out , this was not the dead 's final studio album ; `` built to last '' followed . mydland had more songs on that one , but i think he was overrepresented ; then again , maybe that was necessary , as garcia 's stuff on that disc was pretty weak . in short , as far as the studio is concerned , i think this was the dead 's last great statement ; i would have been quite content if `` built to last '' had never seen daylight . `` black muddy river , '' then , is n't the last song garcia ever would sing in the studio -- but maybe it should have been . what a hauntingly proper final tune it would have been for him
