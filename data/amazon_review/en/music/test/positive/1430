everything 's kool ! what a set ! one disc of hardcore funk , and one disc of great 80s pop . kool and the gang 's transformation is just as radical as fleetwood mac 's was when lindsey and stevie joined , or when talking heads went from new wave to funk . disc one brought back a lot of memories for me ; songs i had completely forgotten about , `` funky stuff '' , `` hollywood swingin ' '' , `` higher plane '' , `` summer madness '' , and `` love and understanding '' . allegedly the early stuff kept james brown awake at night ; the gang was that funky . proof 's on disc one . the songs are mostly instrumental with a smattering of call/response . their m.o . is simple , establish the groove and work it . and then james jt taylor joined in 1979 and , thus disc two . the gang is now a hit machine , cranking out the music like ford turned out thunderbirds : `` ladies night '' , `` too hot '' , `` celebration '' ( which will live long after you and i are gone ) , and on and on and on . even in this phase they still etablish the groove and work it , as displayed on the almost 7 minute `` let 's go dancing '' ... even that 's too short ! whoever put this together at universal deserves a raise or something . the songs are chronological , well written band essay , ample credits . this two disc best of should be the standard to which other record companies strive . get yours today
