prince serves notice to the world on this seminal 80 's lp ! ! man , what can i say about this album but classic ! ! prince was 23 when he dropped this one and forever served notice to the world that he was a different kind of kat and that the whole scape of the pop world as we had known it at that time was going in his direction ! never one to conform or confine himself to any one particular musical genre , he delves into new wave & punk ( dirty mind , when you were mine ) , then grooves us with the nasty but infectious `` do it all night '' ... then he goes into the album 's only slow jam , the lamenting `` got ta broken heart again '' , which is a classic to true prince fans who go all the way back with him ! then side 2 opens with the punk-funky `` uptown '' , which truly captures the vibe of the times of pre-aids , experimental , ambisexual , free-lovin ' late 70 's / early 80 's america ! -- which is the world that i came of age in ! ( i was 16 when this album came out and it seemed that prince was reading my mind ! ) then at the end of `` uptown '' there 's a cool synthesizer effect that swooshes us right into the classic gut-bucket synth funk of `` head '' , which is self- explanatory ! then , at the end of that , the same synth swoosh takes us into prince 's tabu tale of incest as a streetkid of 16 who lives ( albeit antagonistically ! ) with a half sister of 32 who is determined to teach him her warped view of the facts of life or else `` put him on the street again ! '' -- a punked-out , rockin ' , fast-moving piece that caused quite a stir back then ! then the synth swoosh takes us to one of my all-time fave prince `` party til ' you pass out ! '' jams ... . `` party up '' ! ! this song sends this classic album out with a bang ! the `` dirty mind tour '' of late '80 and early '81 was quite a spectacle to behold ! prince broke all the taboos of sexuality , fashion , staging and just brought a whole new energy to the game that just caught you on fire ! he was the opening act ( at that time ! ) for then `` supposedly '' notorious rick james ( rip ) , whose `` fire it up '' tour was all the rage ! but to those of us who were lucky enough to see it , it soon became apparent that prince 's flame made poor rick 's look like a bic lighter ! after about 3 months of what was supposed to be a 6 month tour as rick 's opening act , tired of being upstaged , rick james fired prince from the tour and harbored a bitter resentment of him which lasted up until about a year before his death in 2004 when he had to finally acknowledge that prince rogers nelson was indeed a true genius and a force of nature ! if you do n't have this album in your collection , you 're short-changed 4-real !
