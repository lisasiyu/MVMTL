a truly excellent musical it is a shame to learn that kopit and yeston purchased the rights to the pantom of the opera but were usurped by andrew lloyd webber as it was in the public domain in enland . otherwise , we would have this marvelous music to listen to as much as we now listen to webber 's work . in a way we are fortunate that webber 's work can be heard as well as yeston 's work as the latter was allowed to publish in the us . still , it is sad to realize that the public mainly ignores this work as they think first , that it even exists and second , that it is inferior to the webber 's work . the fact is that phantom is excellent in its own right and has great songs such as `` home '' , `` melodie de paris '' and `` who could have dreamed up you '' . i highly recommend it to anyone .
