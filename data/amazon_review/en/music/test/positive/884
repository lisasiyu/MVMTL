great jazz introduction ! ! ! first let me tell you , when i got this cd the only other jazz i had listened to was miles davis and that `` west coast/cool '' style . this cd opened me up to so much more . i was searching for a cd just of this type that really showcased all the different elements and styles of jazz . while most of this is the vocal type of jazz ( bille holiday , sarah vaughan , ella fitzgerald ... ) there are the instrumental types of jazz , which up in till this cd i thought was the only type of jazz . this really opened me up to the vocal side of jazz , like i may have mentioned before when i purchased this i was a jazz novice , i had heard billie holiday and the like on the radio and tv/movies ( most of the songs on the cd you will reconize ) but never really listened to them . now i find myself listening to ella fitzgerald and louis armstrong more then any other music ( and i listen to a lot of music ) . i also found a new favorite song of mine , summertime by ella and louis . i think most of these songs can be found on other cd 's so if you already own these artist cd 's then you may want to check and see if you do n't already own these songs . but if you are new to jazz like i was , then get this great compilation to start with . peace kevi
