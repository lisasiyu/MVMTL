a five*star* stunner i purchased the re-mastered version , and it sounds like it is live , i.e , you are there , only clearer . the songs are breathtaking , heart-breakingly lovely , and overflowing with joy , like a cool spring breeze blowing on you with the hot sun above . sorry , pat -- i think i broke that one getting it out .
