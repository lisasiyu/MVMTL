this `` oldie '' is definitely a `` goodie '' ! ! ! i was familiar with a few songs by gene pitney that i include in my favorite `` oldies '' . after listening to the entire cd , i am impressed by the range of talent by mr. pitney and how many fantastic songs he recorded . as far as the price ; i feel i received more than i paid for . this cd is a `` must have '' and would be a compliment to any home collection
