lady of the spice lands this is a great acoustic guitar record . i would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys acoustic guitar finely played . the pieces are varied and focus on exquisite flowing melodic ideas . chris brenne 's formidable technique does not overpower the beautiful intricacies of his compositional ideas , but instead serves the demands of each piece . the result is a record that has an integrity that attends to musicality first and foremost - sensitive , serene and strong playing
