great album this is one of my most favorite commissioned albums ever . reason being is because fred and marvin are great singers and this was the last project they had together before their solo careers really took flight . i love this album , `` dare to believe '' is a classic . `` i 'm learning '' is one of my all-time favorites . `` love is the way '' and `` come home '' are two blazing , bumping tracks that will get you bobbing your head . then the album goes urban praise and worship on the last few tracks which is uplifting and spiritual . `` draw me nearer '' is , vocally , commissioned at its best . another one to add to the collection
