flawed gem . this album is a bit of an enigma to me , the material stands up , really well , but there 's definitely weaknesses throughout it as well . let 's start with the good -- certainly , the songs are brilliant -- `` love and mercy '' and `` melt away '' , both really great sentimental pieces ( the latter in particular is a personal favorite ) , `` there 's so many '' and `` let it shine '' both feature great vocal arrangements , and `` rio grande '' is just magnficiant . and certainly many of the others ( `` walkin ' the line '' , `` meet me in my dreams tonight '' ) are more than good enough . but there are some flaws -- brian 's voice sounds odd to me , i ca n't place it , almost forced , and his falsetto is definitely limited , probably most obvious on `` one for the boys '' and `` there 's so many '' . beyond this though , the biggest problem with the album is the '80s production , too many synthesizers , some of the songs would ( and did in recent live performances ) benefit from more acoutic arrangements . overall however , the album is rewarding , and you sort of get used to its odd sound . the bonus tracks on the reissue are so-so , my favorite is actually the track titled `` brian on 'love and mercy ' '' , which also features a snippet of a piano-and-vocal demo of the song . the b-sides are kind of blah , but the demos are all really interesting
