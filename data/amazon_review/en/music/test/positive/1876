incredible ep let me just say that joe satriani is in opinion the best guitar player/musician in the world , and to be able to see him live is an unforgettable experience . dreaming # 11 , and disc 2 of time machine are as close as you can get to experiencing satch live . the highlight on this disc has to be the live recording of memories , it 's almost double the length of the studio version and a hundred times better ( although the studio version is still a very moving piece of music ) . if you are any kind of satriani fan , or guitar enthusist pick up this album , you wo n't regret it
