better than i thought i was lucky enough meet them and see them perform and these guys are so sweet and have major talent ! my faves off the album are back again , on and on , suzie , six minutes , on my own , and civil sin . the best ones i have on repeat though is ivy parker and shoot me down . i totally love those songs cuz they 're pretty deep . they have more of a hard-fi/bloc party vibe to them too . the big plus to this album to it is their unknown bonus track added onto shoot me down.. that one is definately worth listenin ' to
