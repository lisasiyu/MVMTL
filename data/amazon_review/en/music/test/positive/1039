he couldve been a contender standout tracks : its funky enough , mind blowin , lend me an ear , let the bass go , beautiful but deadly , the doc & the doctor , no one can do it better , whirlwind pyramid , the formula , portrait of a masterpiece , the grand finale ( west coast version of the symphony ) . filler : the commercial skits are pointless are obviously put on to take up space . bottom line : doc was proof ( in the 80s ) that the west coast had emcees that can spit with the best of them . doc had a killer flow and a freestyle that can only be described as crazy ! the production by dr. dre and yella is superb at best . its unfortunate that he got into an accident and lost his voice and is now reduced to ghostwriting raps for dr. dre and snoop ( what you think i dont know ? ) . he could have been as big as jay-z was in the game without the commercial appeal that jay-z has . this cd is definetely worth being in your collection
