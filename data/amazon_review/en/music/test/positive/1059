mo ' and betta ! ! ! if you enjoyed `` 33-1/3 '' by the frank and joe show , you will doubtless enjoy their sophomore offering , `` 66-2/3 '' . it has all of the consummate musicianship , chemistry and inventive inspiration as the first cd . and it 's every bit as accessible and enjoyable ! very highly recommended ! !
