williams does an irish turn once again john williams shows why he is so sought after as a soundtrack composer . anyone who has heard of this movie knows that it focuses on a young irish couple seeking a new life in turn-of-the-century america , and williams immerses himself so thoroughly in that reality that you almost feel as if you 're listening to a cd by one of the many celtic groups like clannad or gaelic storm , only without the vocals . from the triumphant to the contemplative to the pugnacious to the lively rhythm of the jig , every aspect of the irish musical character is here . ( you may find that you have to turn up the volume : for some reason it is n't recorded at a particularly listenable level ! ) there are also moments ( as in & quot ; shannon is shot & quot ; ) when williams 's own voice , so familiar to us from the & quot ; star wars & quot ; movies and his many other triumphs , makes a surprise appearance . once the characters have reached the west ( & quot ; oklahoma territory , & quot ; & quot ; the land race & quot ; ) he blends his recurring irish themes with a musical motif that suggests the newness and astonishing size of the country and the many adjustments the young pioneers have to make . i ca n't help wondering what williams would be able to do with a & quot ; real & quot ; western ( why did n't kevin costner hire him for & quot ; open range , & quot ; for instance ? ) . an impressive example of a great composer 's work
