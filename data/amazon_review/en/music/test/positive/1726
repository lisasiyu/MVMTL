passionate , intense , yet beautiful a stunning album . yes , it 's & quot ; free & quot ; and & quot ; out , & quot ; but it 's also very lyrical and emotional music . one of hutcherson 's best performances , by the way . tip : if dave holland 's & quot ; conference of the birds & quot ; is one of your favorite albums , you have to hear this
