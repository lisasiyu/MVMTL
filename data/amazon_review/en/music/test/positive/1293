yiddish radio project charming , delightful , and surprising , it evokes and energizes dim memories and resurrects the full emotional impact of memories still fresh . and levine mit dein flying machine was startling in its evocation of a time when jews were desperate for acceptance , and went to great efforts to memorialize the accomlpishments of jewish americans in song and otherwise , no longer content to remain outside looking in . i bought several cd 's and gave them as gifts , which were big hits with all .
