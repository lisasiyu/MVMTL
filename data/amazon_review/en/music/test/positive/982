burton cummings was certainly an underrated vocalist ! ! ! when one mentions the best rock singers of all time , how come burton cummings ' name does n't come up ? all the evidence exists on this disc that he was one hell of a singer , delivering some of the greatest vocals to some of the greatest songs ever . perhaps because the guess who was seen as a top 40 group has kept him from his due ? let 's start with one of the top three songs ever put to tape , `` these eyes . '' this masterpiece has all the ingredients of a timeless song - moving bass line , masterful strings , catchy rhythm , and the pained vocal stylings of burton . elsewhere , he shines on `` undun , '' `` no time , '' and elevates the standard `` american woman '' to legendary , something that lenny kravitz had no chance of doing . kudos to the compilers of this for going with the full length version of `` american woman '' - the intro is absolutely essential to its impact . i do n't forsee the guess who ever making it to the rock and roll hall of fame , but let 's at least recognize one of the greatest voices in rock and letting these timeless tunes wash over us in am ecstasy !
