tonight is right for love ( with meredith baxter-birney ) chef aid is worth the buy . this very funny record includes & quot ; live & quot ; intros to each song by chef , not to mention a selection of his greatest hits , like the title above my review , which he performs with meatloaf . cartman and the gang join the fun as well , along with ned , primus , rick james w/ ike turner , rancid , wyclef , devo , and elton john ? buy chef aid and play it with someone you love
