his best ! this is by far his best album . he goes for meaningful yet witty lyrics and the music is a mix of old and new . i ca n't stop listening to this one ! ! my favorites are `` slow dancing in a burning room '' and `` i do n't trust myself '' . this young man has had a lot more life experience than his age would suggest . we need him around for a long time ! !
