lost biker psychedelia of the highest form dragonfly was actually a band called the legend who 's debut album ( on which they were n't allowed to play or contribute songs ) was somewhat butchered by their record company . so they decided to pursue other interests . under a different name ( association with that legend album was n't gon na happen ) , they recorded this . they did n't have the best sound quality ( crackles and pops still cover the sound on cd ) , but they had enough technology to mess around . throughout this album , the track suddenly jumps into backward recording , slows down suddenly , or dissipates altogether . the boys explode into ridiculous giggles , get wasted by a moaning trombone , and turn into a giant rolling ball of mung at the end before returning to form . along the way , we have some good songs . `` blue monday '' opens the album with a moan of `` oooh my god.. '' then harsh chords , before rhythm guitarist gene cracks his throat in anger . `` enjoy yourself '' is bouncy , thoughtful psychedelia , `` crazy woman '' sounds very 60s and somewhat moby grape . `` to be free '' is a good bit of yearning and hope : the classic 60s message . there 's just all kinds of good stuff here . the drums are fierce and the fuzz-toned lead guitar is excellent . there 's some heavy solos on this album . great performing . gene 's vocals sometimes sound like keith relf of the yardbirds and sometimes like jack bruce of cream . it 's forgotten , and that 's a pity . take an acid trip ito the good ol ' days of heavy psychedelic hard rock . it 'll blow you away
