party vibe - instant fun beck 's best at his hippest , funkiest , top . put this cd in your player and a party is virtually bound to start . unlike almost any other pop artist beck oozes talent and imagination . he shrugs off convention and creates an amalgam of musical styles that always seem to fit just right . each of beck 's new cd 's always seem new and some fans of his earlier works might not like this new one but if you like any kind of dance or funk there 's a whole lot of fun here . mixed bizness gets my vote for the best .
