yes indeed , ebm is dead it has been a long while since i last submitted a review on amazon because i have been calmly waiting for that divine inspiration to catch me off guard when i least expect it . you see , i had been in a bit of a funk lately , as i 'd found myself in what was shaping up to be a sizable drought in regards to finding some new music that really moved me , both inside and out . enter : neuroticfish . as menacingly delicious as mr. sascha himself , this fish has one potent bite . honestly , who knows what genre this type of music truly fits into ; synthpop , future pop , new wave , darkwave , ebm , industrial -- -it 's all electronic and good from my perspective . however i must also admit that like one of the previous reviewers , i am quite picky about what i will listen to and enjoy . it takes a lot more than a few 'hot beats ' blasting out of a subwoofer to make me happy . the comparisons to apop , vnv , etc are all relevant , but while i am familiar with and respect those so-called `` top contenders of the ebm scene , '' i feel that neuroticfish music posesses a depth and vibrancy to it that is fresh , exhilarating and immensely satisfying , which is more than what i can say for any other `` ebm '' band . the music pumps and throbs with all the seasonings of top notch dark , dance club beats and is also melodic , which seems to be a commodity that often places it into the classification of synthpop , which of course automatically gets the label of being too wimpy , poppy , sappy to be labeled as ebm ( and i thought goths were picky . ) but alas , it 's not until we hear sascha 's deep , butterflies-in-stomach-inducing voice that the magic truly begins . he sings with a variety of colorful emotions that range from heart wrenching and tinged with animmosity to tastefully demented ( `` they 're coming to take me away '' is a song that my mother described as being freaky , disturbing music of a carnival gone quite wrong , ha ha ) and melodic ( yes , that deep baritone does sometimes resemble david gahan , which is the highest compliment that one can possibly get from me . ) this music has the intense , catchy , and emotional clout of first rate synthpop combined with the deliriously ecstatic dance riffs of ebm . standout tracks are the intense `` i do n't need the city , '' `` waving hands , '' the bomb , '' `` they 're coming to take me away , '' and `` i never chose you . '' pretender and not a contender ? i doubt sascha is trying to distinguish himself as a product of any 'scene ' anyway . afterall , ebm is dead = )
