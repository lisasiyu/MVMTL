another excellent blues cd from one of the new stars albert cummings seemed to capture the feel of srv very well on his previous cd and it was excellent ( even if a bit derivative ) . this one is a lot less srv and a lot more cummings . not one dud track and a consistenly high standard throughout . definetly one of the best of the current crop of white electric blues man . if you like the guitar and the blues , this is a must have
