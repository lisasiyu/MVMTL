i 'm so happy i bought this cd ! i 've been a fan of the grateful dead studio output for maybe about ten years . i 've recently joined the real deadheads somewhat and have started to appreciate the live jams . i 'm coming along on the jam side of the dead , which i think is the side that most deadheads love , but i absolutely love the great stuff from the `` studio dead . '' i guess the studio dead is workingman 's dead and american beauty . this album should be bought by fans of those two abums . i think this is from the same era , and jerry garcia really seems to be at some sort of creative high . it provides a window into the `` jam dead '' in easily digestible 3-6 minute songs on some of the tracks , and further proof that jerry garcia could write great concise songs as well . there are a few spacy instrumentals that lead up to `` eep hour '' that are n't all that great , but , as stated in the liner notes , these can work as an intro to eep hour . if you 're on the fence about this one , there are 7 incredible songs on this album , buy it
