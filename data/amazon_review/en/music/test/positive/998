boston for the death metal set ... .. ahh , death metal . most people either love it or hate it . one of the biggest complaints levied against the genre in particular is typically the vocal style , which is ( to the neophyte ) an almost incomprehensible , guttural growl . sort of like the crypt keeper meets the cookie monster . there are , however , many variations on this style , especially now that more `` extreme '' heavy metal has become more mainstream mid-decade , leading to a flood of different death metal bands . this canadian group sets themselves apart primarily through an extremely poppy vocal style and superb musicianship . sure , the requisite benchmarks of the genre are there-fast , heavy riffs and a vicious , almost acidic death metal bark ; but this will suddenly give way to unbelievably catchy , hooky two-and three-part vocal harmonies during a chorus or verse then suddenly revert back to the `` evil '' vocal style . it really is quite unique and original . i am instantly reminded of the first time i heard a friend 's boston album in the eighties ... it really is just a huge wall of sound , extremely well-produced . this really should n't work in the context of death metal , but it sounds amazing ! meanwhile , the guitarists are shredding all over the place in an often quite progressive and technical , and always ultra-heavy manner , as if they are auditioning for dream theater ... .the album opening deluge of neoclassical-style rapid fire twin-guitar shred licks are a good introduction to what you can expect for the rest of the album . the lyrics are a bit melodramatic , unfortunately , but of course , this is death metal . sometimes it 's kinda cool ( `` eradication of the mind/beginning of the end '' ) and sometimes it 's kinds lame ( `` floating in a black sea of agony '' ) but always interesting . i am excited to hear the follow-up , which should be the band 's big album , if this was just a warm-up ... .any fan of the genre should check this out , although purists might balk at the `` non-traditional '' vocal style . highly recommended
