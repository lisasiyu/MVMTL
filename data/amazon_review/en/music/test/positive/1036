more evidence proving they were groovilicious if you 're a style council fan you must own this album . phony musicians stink when recorded live but the style council sounded even better live than in the studio ( `` home and abroad '' is also a necessity ) . this disc spans several years and features covers of some soul gems along with their own songs . they groove so hard on one nation under a groove , meeting ( over ) up yonder and hanging on to a memory to justify the cost . the only downers are some snippets of mick talbot singing lead ( oy vey ) and a couple mediocre tracks , but those are minor trifles with this gem for us council fans
