the best cd ever ! ... what a way to start the new year ! ... this cd is awesome ! there are four songs on the cd from cinderella ii , with brooke allison giving it her all and shining brightly . the new version of bibbidi bobbidid boo is wonderful ! they took the classical version from long ago and gave it a new twist which is sure to delight everyone of all ages ! if you have enjoyed walt disney forever , like myself , or are just tuning in , you will love this album ! ..
