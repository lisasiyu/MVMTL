laid back ec , living and loving in south florida i have to confess that , while i love clapton , his albums are often a hit-and-miss affair . and i ca n't say i am a fan of the numerous recent blues tribute albums he has put out lately . for me i enjoy his work with cream , his guest work , his first few albums , the one he recorded with the band , a few older live albums , and bits of the phil collins-produced record in the early 80s . after that it 's a fall-off , but i am thankful for all the great music he has turned out over the years . i have been listening to 461 a lot lately . it holds up exceedingly well . the groove is laid-back , with solid musicianship and expert song selection . it makes for great road music , especially `` willie and the hand jive , '' `` i shot the sheriff , '' and the classic closer , `` mainline florida . '' the ballads are beautiful , too . there is not a weak track on the album . there is a consistent tone , an aversion to excess and a concentration on the note and harmonic `` fit '' that makes this album an overall winner in ec 's catalog . as someone who used to party in ec 's old house at 461 ocean boulevard in golden beach in the early 80s , let me say -- you did it ( and us ) proud
