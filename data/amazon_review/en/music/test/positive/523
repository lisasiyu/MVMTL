a beautiful winter garden having already recorded a full-length christmas album , `` to drive the cold winter away , '' loreena mckennitt went into peter gabriel 's real world studios for three days with some musicians in july 1995 to record five christmas songs just for fun . the end result is the christmas ep , `` a winter garden . '' just 22 minutes long , `` a winter garden '' can easily be taken as a companion disc to `` to drive the cold winter away . '' loreena & company perform this quintet of holiday songs beautifully , especially the gorgeous , nearly-7 minute rendering of `` god rest ye merry gentlemen , '' easily one of the very best versions of this classic song ever recorded . there are also spirited performances of `` coventry carol , '' `` good king wenceslas , '' `` snow '' ( originally featured on `` to drive the cold winter away '' ) , and `` seeds of love . '' `` a winter garden '' is a lovely holiday postcard from loreena mckennitt .
