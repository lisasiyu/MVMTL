the best ... the ozark mountain daredevils will probably always be my very favorite american band . i believe they would have been my fave regardless , but they have a special sentimental cache for me -- i came from the same town they are from ( springfield , mo ) and in the 1970 's , we got to hear them often . the secret of the daredevil 's music was that it made you feel really good . i ca n't think of a single unit of musicians who so consistently produced music that can make you feel better . the music on this album , and many of the records that followed just seem to clear your head of all bad thoughts . the daredevils are first-rate singers , musicians , and songwriters . they 're just the best . always have been , always will be ... this is what american music was supposed to be about . thanks , guys..
