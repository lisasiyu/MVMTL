a cinematic return to form this is one of my favorite prince albums . it 's incredibly cinematic and creative . his voice sounds amazing and he really sounds more inspired than he has in years . the production is also fantastic . discovering this record was one of the best music experiences i have ever had . it was right when i was starting to explore prince 's catalogue ( started listening to him in 2003 ) . i had no idea what the record was about and the way rainbow children goes into muse 2 the pharaoh , it 's beautiful . beautiful music . there is this deep darth vader style voice that annoys a lot of people but to me it just adds to the cinematic quality of the record . i wish there was more music like this . my favorites are probably rainbow children muse 2 the pharaoh everywhere everlasting now last december . even wedding feast is a fun little number . joins purple rain and sign of the times in my top 3 for prince .
