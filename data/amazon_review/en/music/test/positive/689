4.5 stars weller 's return to form this first selfmade and coproduced solo album from the modfather was what the style council failed to do . in the same vein of much of what he recorded with his followup band after the jam- weller ditched the cheesy synths and made a clean break with a more `` earthy '' soul sound and better production . wellers voice also improved greatly from this point on . songs like above the clouds- remember how we started- and bullrush all sound like council numbers in their style but they succeed on all levels- something the stc only managed a few times despite some great tunes . into tomorrow sounds like what the jam may have sounded like if they stayed together . ( this is one of wellers best tunes still ! ) part curtis mayfield-marvin gaye- with a heavy nod towards early traffic- paul weller rose from the ashes and became a force again . i can not recommend this and wildwood enough- both are essential for fans of any music- rock pop soul r+b mod . other highlights include kosmos and bitterness rising .
