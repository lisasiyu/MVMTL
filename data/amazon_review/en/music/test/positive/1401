still writing great music upon first listening to 'fundamental ' i was n't too impressed . nothing really grabbed me . it all sounded like typical pet shop boys . but as i listened more , the songs began to take a life all their own . 'the sodom and gomorrah show ' and 'numb ' were the two that stuck out . 'sodom and gomorrah show ' , with it 's driving beat and catchy melody and 'numb ' and it 's emotional plea to 'feel nothing ' were both examples of fantastic harmony between lyric and melody . the group has survived for more than 20 years in an era that no longer embraces their brand of pop without compromising their message or their sound . i 'm grateful to have had privilege of going to one of their shows recently . mainly because they 're still touring , but also because they retain every bit of what made them famous in the 80s with a little song called 'west end girls '
