a hot traviata i 'm bewildered by the negative comments regarding this recording . i finally obtained a copy of this and i have absolutely fallen in love with it . i have never heard a traviata as youthful , ardent , visceral and sexy , yes sexy , as this one . ok , there 's some strange things in the first act , for instance , the chorus balance is off and rizzi loses control between the stage and pit a few times . but , in the course of a week , this has become a favorite recording of the work . netrebko 's sound is gorgeous . she reminds me somewhat of the young freni a la russo . she 's outgoing in the first act but introspect in the balance of the opera when confronted with real love . villazon is a god here and although this role can be sung beautifully by others , i have never heard a more well developed interpretation of this role . they are both very convincing together and what a pleasure it is today to hear two young singers with personality in their throats . their scenes have a desperate quality to them that no other interpretation has , as if they both understand how doomed their romance is . there 's a pronounced dark streak of tragedy running throughout their entire performance that the others lack . hampson has turned out to be a major surprise here as well . his vocal performance is complete and he develops germont 's character completely . not since gobbi 's performance on the emi recording ( now available on testament ) have i heard any baritone really use his voice to act this role . i 'm even looking forward to the dvd release in mid june . putting the hype aside , this is one of the finest recordings of traviata i 've ever heard . the committment of the principle singers is just stunning .
