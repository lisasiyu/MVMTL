fun listen ... more fun the second time , even more fun after that ! i 'm a recording engineer by trade . i sit in little rooms with no windows and big speakers listening to the same song for 15 hour stretches for weeks in a row . every now and again a record will roll through that is actually fun to make . this sounds like one of those recordings . whether or not the players took this seriously or not will only be known to them and the production team , but the presentation comes across as if it was just a bunch of talented friends hanging around a studio and having some fun making music . with a great cover version of one of my absolute favorite hank songs , the album might have been able to leave one or two songs in the can ... but rip the album to an ipod and those songs can be the right breath of fresh air as you 're driving . the audio quality and production decisions of the recording should also be noted . yeah , there are some notes of questionable tuning but the their presentation is so believable the record would not have been served if those notes had been corrected . matt marinelli captured the sounds with perfection , and did n't over process or manipulate it later [ or so it seems ! ! ] . the record works for me in a big way and i for one am exceptionally happy to own a copy of this recording [ a client for whom i 'm going to start a project in a few months sent me the copy as a kind of template for the way he 'd like his project to come out ... if we get 1/2 way there then that is going to be one damn fun project ! ! ]
