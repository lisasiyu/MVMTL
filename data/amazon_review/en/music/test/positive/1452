buy this album for q.e.d . and land 's end ! ! here is how i see it . i am a huge fan of one of a kind and spice of life and other bruford albums with yes . this recording has it 's moments and these are memorable moments ! it also has some weak points . but i am going to focus on why you should run out and buy this now . there are two tracks on this cd that are must haves for bruford fans . here is what they are called ... q.e.d and land 's end . these two are killer ! ! the suspense and tension , the release after a build up , the drumming , the incredible guitar and bass work with piano is so satisfying that i would be embarressed to tell you how many times i have listened to these masterpieces . i urge you to listen to these fantastic songs over and over again ! they really are that good . by the way i got to meet bill bruford in oakland at yoshi ( a jazz venue ) last year in the spring and he was so much fun to see with earthworks . anyway if you have not heard one of a kind , buy it now because it is the best jazz album of all time !
