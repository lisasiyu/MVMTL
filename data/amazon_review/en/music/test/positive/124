waited too long to get it i didnt have the most remote idea that i was going to like this album this much . my only experience from the band was clint eastwood and recently feel good , which even though i thought it was great i wasnt too crazy about it.but i recently watched the whole demon days album played at the manchester opera house and ... oh man ! i was totally blown away ! the performance waas amazing , i totally loved the songs , and all the energy that is coming from that stage makes you get up on your feet and start singing too . god ! i wish i could have been there ! i had to buy the cd , love kids with guns , dirty harry , last living souls . even the soft and mellow songs are amazing . i was talking to a friend when i started watching the dvd and i had to put the phone down.if you like something different , away from the ordinary , catch damon albarn this time
