you 're my sickness diva destruction is another band that i just had to check out without having to listening to their music . i was intrigued by what i have read about them on metropolis record 's website . it also helped that they are signed to my favorite record label so i had some inkling to what the band sounded like ... somewhat . i bought the cd last thursday and since then i have been listening to the cd non-stop ... the in your face production from scott humphrey and frank gryner knocked me off my feet . i have n't heard such clean production as what i just heard on `` exposing the sickness '' . debra fogarty 's vocals ( w/back up vocals from sharon blackstone ) reminded me a lot of siouxsie sioux and tina and susan from switchblade symphony . very powerful . debra could put a lot of today 's singers to shame . the bass , drums , guitars , and programming blended well , a mixture of rock and industrial music . as i am listening to `` exposing the sickness '' again , diva destruction reminds me a lot like their fellow labelmates clan of xymox and bella morte but with female lead singer , especially bella morte but with more programming and less guitars . i loved `` exposing the sickness '' right from the get go with the first track `` heathcliff '' . my favorite songs off this album has to be the remix to `` when trees would dance '' ( as well as the original version ) , `` tempter '' , `` valley of the scars '' , and `` hypocrite '' . i definitely plan on acquiring their first album as well as future releases from the band in the near future
