it 's been well over thirty years and i i have had it since it came out in 1973 , and its ' still as good today as it was back then . wow there are certainly are a lot of reviews written about this record.it is hard to describe this album , it 's not quite jazz , it 's not quite `` funk '' , it 's not quite `` fusion '' music , it stands on its ' own as something else . kind of a combination of all three . at the time , keyboard innovations were really coming into vogue and herbie really knew how to exploit it on this album . better than his later electronic stuff , which was a lot more commercial . other contemporaries from this time include chick corea , jan hammer , george duke , and to a certain extent , stevie wonder .
