the escalator the escalator and the man stand at the bottom summed up the album even before i had the pleasure of listening to such beauty and intelligence in my entire life time of listening to folk rock music this has affected me the most i ca n't tell how much.. i know it 's an clinche but.it left me speechless i did n't know whether to cry jump up and down with merriment of..just sit quietly and seep in the beauty i had just been laid next too me . all them emotions from a voice guitar and a trumpet at the end of broken arrows how do you say can that happen ? because this guy has talent . to transmit an beauty and vibrance over to the listeners ears in my mind you have to be in tune with yourself to fully appreciate the album . we all have these emotions in us to appreciate this album on another level and i have and i wo n't be turning back it changed my life this afternoon.. the escalator only goes up..
