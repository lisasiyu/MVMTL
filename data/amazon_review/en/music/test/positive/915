a good but imperfect companion volume to `` greatest hits '' stevie ray vaughan 's original greatest hits album was far too short at just 11 not particularly well chosen tracks , but this 1999 addition goes a long way towards making up for that . it is not a hits package per se , since most of these songs were never released as singles , but it features lots of excellent songs like `` willie the wimp '' , `` ai n't gone 'n ' give up on love '' , `` empty arms '' , and vaughan 's magnificent rendition of doyle bramhall 's acoustic survivor story `` life by the drop '' . that still does n't make it a definitive career retrospective , though , even when coupled with `` greatest hits '' vol . i , and the inclusion of tunes like `` pipeline '' and `` superstition '' is suspect considering what has been left out . at 27 songs , these two albums are trumped by the superb double-disc collection `` the essential stevie ray vaughan and double trouble '' , which is cheaper than `` greatest hits '' vol . i and ii together , yet features a stronger selection of songs , and six more of them as well
