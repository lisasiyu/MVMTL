now wait one minute ! now , i know i 'm not the only one that realizes that critics barely know what the hell their talking about . i must admit that the first time i heard this album i was not that thrilled by it . but the more i heard it , it quickly became one of my favorites . i think this album is very underated and quite brilliant . i believe that this album allowed prince to develope as an artist in a big way .
