exellent cd by this pioneering jazz vocal group ... the boswell sisters were the 1st group to truly use jazz in vocal harmony , there arrangements by lead singer connie boswell were innovative , and full of jazz syncopations and the blues . this pioneering jazz vocal group would influence and pave the way for groups as diverse as lambert , hendricks & ross to todays take 6 . a great cd of great new orleans jazz harmony vocals . the bozzies are backed here by combos that feature such solosists as bunny barigan , eddie lang , joe venuti , jimmy & tommy dorsey , among others
