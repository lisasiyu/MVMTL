music to drink codeine cough syrup by . richard cheese and lounge against the machine have done the obvious , obviously . while not strictly as bad as william ( bill ) murry 's obnoxious lounge act , nor as over-the-top as the late andy kaufman 's tony clifton persona , `richard cheese ' keeps his performance within the character 's velvet rope guidelines , and instead minimizes and only slightly deconstructs the classic lounge song . this is neither sinatra nor bennet , nor is it your little brother doing a bad imitation of them . this is serious lounge , yet alternative . like waking from a familiar dream , richard cheese 's renditions are still recognizable , yet obviously something `` other '' , and yet as pure as the originals . richard cheese and lounge against the machine , therefore , are not tribute creators in another style , like dred zepplin , for they are members of their genre . they also are not a joke on the genre within the genre , as was the lamented `` nig heist '' within the touring `` black flag '' shows of the early 80s . neither do they make `lounge ' more `lounge ' with overproduction , digital techniques , and rich strings . indeed , minimalism and limited range are the bywords . or perhaps it is driven by a small production budget . and the obvious question must be answered : is richard cheese `` cheesy ? '' only in the sophomoric dimensions of a joke as obvious as a goiter , where we cry out `` dick cheese ! '' in the same breath that we call `` mike hunt ! '' over a smoky crowd of strapless cocktail dresses , and elicit a few titters . cheesy , yes , but the music does compel repeated listening , like alex chilton covering `` more '' with bobby darrin 's shade speaking through the whisky , there is something there , there . but richard cheese and lounge against the machine are not cocktail classics to spin when you have the smoking jacket on and the new recruits from the secretary pool dropping by your place after the show , for this lounge set speaks more to the `cocktails made with codeine ' set of cool . and yes , i am dying to know what sir-mix-a-lot thinks of this version of `` baby got back .
