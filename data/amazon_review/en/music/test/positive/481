some shoegazing going on here . my wife and i saw this band at slim 's in san francisco saturday night and i must tell you , there was some definite shoegazing going on . for those of you who do n't know what shoegazing is , i 'll explain it as simple as possible . picture the band standing on stage , staring down at their shoes ( hence the term , `` shoegazing '' ) as they release a continuous hum of fuzz and distortion from their guitars . when it 's done right , as film school does , it can be very powerful . the floors , tables , chairs , and even my chest was vibrating to the sound . film school is much more than this , however . in most songs , their shoegazing is limited to just portions of the song . the songs are broken up by wonderful vocal melodies , baselines , and guitar picking . you will hear what i mean when you listen to this album . highly recommended
