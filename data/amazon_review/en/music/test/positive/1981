under da sea we actually own the cd that was originally released when the movie was first released . it is one of our favorites . i 'm not sure what several others are talking about when they say this one has the origninal score . the cd 's have the same exact music , with the exception of the 2nd cd . as for the songs on the 2nd cd , we have heard several on radio disney . they are okay once you get passed the whole remake issue . i actually enjoy the jonas brothers version of poor unfortunate souls .
