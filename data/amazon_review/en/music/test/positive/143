nina persson and friends nina persson 's `` debut solo album '' ( as described on the promo sticker ) began life in sweden in 1998 , the same year as the cardigans ' gran turismo . it was completed in america throughout 2000 with producer mark linkous from the excellent sparklehorse , during time off from the cardigans , which had clearly taken on a life of its own , not entirely of her choosing . a camp was born in 1997 after a meeting with niclas frisk , who co-wrote most of the songs and plays on several of them . boyfriend nathan larson ( from shudder to think ) also plays on all but one of the tracks and co-wrote the opening song . frequent flyer sets the mood of the album as it opens with eerie samples , theremin sounds , thuddy drums and nina 's gorgeously bittersweet vocals over an engaging melody . in fact the tunes retain a high standard throughout and the quirky production ( though mainstream by sparklehorse standards ) is never less than complementary and interesting . angel of sadness is a stand-out song although i can buy you made a first class single . although the album consists mostly of original material , a few stray covers shoe-horn their way in - the replacements ' rock 'n ' roll ghost ; bizarrely , restless heart 's old us hit the bluest eyes in texas ; and walking the cow , one of the best known songs of cult singer daniel johnston , whose 2003 album fear yourself was also produced by mark linkous . a camp manages the delicate trick of being unmistakably , instantly belonging to nina persson whilst at the same time being quite distinct from the cardigans . may her future projects be as successfu
