the time has come man jae millz is like one of my favorite underground rappers of all time . i had most of the mixtapes that have his songs on it . this cd does n't look like a mixtapes to me , it looks like his debut album . i listed to his whole cd and it 's banging . the song `` shadow battling '' samples of special ed song `` special '' on his still got it made album . one time , i thought he was related to jay-z but then i found out that he was n't related to him . somebody need to promote jae millz because this dude can rap ; listen to his rhymes . i saw all his freestyle videos on youtube and some of them were long . some of these rappers these days ca n't even write rhymes . buy this cd to support jae millz
