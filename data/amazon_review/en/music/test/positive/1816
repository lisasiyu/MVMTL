truly a sensational piece ! this music makes you want to get up and dance ! the first few tracks are the best , but the whole cd is very good . i could not stop listening to son fro by africando and many more . hide this cd because once you pop it in , your friends will never want to give it back to you . after owning gypsy caravan , afro-latino , afro latin party , salsa around the world , cuba and many more i have come to say that this is one of the best putumayo we have seen up to date . also check out putumayo colombia-it is sure to get you dancing like you have never danced before !
