about time ... like many i owned this in vinyl and was amazed it took so long to come out . and to those who said they found this album a little bit sappy , i say `` so the hell what . '' everything in that era was sappy and if your worried that a little sappiness may alter your manhood then i recommend against the purchase of this cd . but if you want to listen to something thats gon na make you feel pretty damn good this is it . s & c have a well blended album here . the well known and recognized `` diamond girl '' followed by `` ruby jean and billy lee '' leads it off . both were big hits and still sound good . `` intone my servant '' follows and though not a hit you 'll wonder why . like all the others a beautifully uplifting harmonic piece . `` we may never pass this way again '' another hit shows once again how s & c can change a beautifull melody and lift your soul right out of your body and make it fly . `` nine houses '' starts off kinda odd ( the song has a mid east flare to it ) but hear it out . vocals will come in lator and pick it up . `` standing on a mountain top '' by far is one of my favorites a great countryish sound and a really great sounding guitar in this one that 'll make you feel like dancing and singing to it . `` it 's gon na come down on you '' a minor hit shoulda been `` major '' starts off mellow and beautifull and like most of there songs in this album just lifts you right up with an increase in tempo . `` jessica '' has got to be the most sappy song of the bunch . but , hey ! my niece 's name is `` jessica and it was once a favorite of mine and still is a beautifull song . `` `` dust on my saddle '' a country diddy that you may find yourself singing word for word after some time . `` wisdom '' is the only song i never listen to its a jazzy piece and i dont care for jazz much but even i got ta admit they do show off their talent on the horns . in short this is a great album from beginning to end ( which is rare to find nowadays ) and really represents the times in which it was written ( early 70 's ) enjoy
