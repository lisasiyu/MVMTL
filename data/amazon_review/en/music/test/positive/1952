one of , if not the best electronic music album ever made my title for this review may sound a bit over the top , but rest assured , it is not an exaggeration . this music was composed using a synth that the berrons built themselves ( this was before you could buy a synth ) and composed this music for the sci-fi film . whether you like the movie or not , this music stands on it 's own . brilliant compositions and beautiful , innovative electronics that interestingly enough , despite all the resources and technology available now , easily surpass most electronic work being done today . for fans of good , serious electronic music ( and by good i do n't mean techno or some crap like that ) , this is essential music . do not miss out on this masterpiece
