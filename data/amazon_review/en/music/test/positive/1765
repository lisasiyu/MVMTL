warning : check the shingles on your roof ... ... ... ... ... ... .. ... ... ... before playing mama feelgood , or vocalist lyn collins is going to leave your home in need of some repairs . from the guitar-piano-guitar introduction , collins delivers a funk tour-de-force performance in a classic song on a great soundtrack for an underrated movie that stars fred williamson . the score was composed by james brown and fred wesley , which starts with a smoking r & b number - down and out in new york city - and ends drenched in the blues - like it is , like it was . it is four consecutive numbers which makes black caesar not only a remarkable soundtrack , but one of the best albums ever issued by brown . the mid-tempo of boss bounces into brown at his funky best - make it good to yourself . collins then tears it up , with the ballad - mama 's dead - a gem of an emotional ride by brown . there are several instrumentals , with the jazzy sportin ' life and the quick pace in chase emerging as the best . brown wore the crown as `` the godfather of soul '' after the soundtrack was released in february 1973 . and the soundtrack leaves no doubt that j.b. set the rules for admittance into the court of funky royalty .
