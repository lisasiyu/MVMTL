firehouse talent ... acousticly ! one of my favorite cd 's ! ! ! talent certainly comes out when they can cover an old southern rock hit like 'seven bridges road ' and do it so smoothly ! the acoustic guitars rock with rhythm and funk . i never knew firehouse to be this talented ! it sure shines out in this acoustic compilation of their most remembered hits ! being partial to modern country rock and southern rock ... i ca n't help but be doubly pleased with hearing a steel guitar added to my all time fav . by this band , `` love of a lifetime '' . this is a must have for any firehouse fan
