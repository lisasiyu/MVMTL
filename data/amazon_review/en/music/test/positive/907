great for kids and adults my 3 yr old got this for christmas and absolutely loves it . we dance to it all the time . i went to workout the other day to find it was in player instead of my normal workout cd ... and already into my workout decided to keep going . it was great to workout to . very energetic like the show and good for variety in my workout . i may have to get a second one for me !
