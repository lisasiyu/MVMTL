all of my favorite neil songs on here i recall this period of neil diamond 's hits between about 1978 and 1982 . i still like yesterday 's songs and that smooth groove . i love september morn and its relaxing pace -- sounds like you could hear it on a quiet breezy day with the windows open . america means so much now in its patriotic theme . i still love love on the rocks -- unlike anything i heard on the radio back in 1980 -- it 's so adventurous when i hear it . i like the rock stomp on forever in blue jeans . but let 's cut the chase to his classic duet with barbra streisand in you do n't bring me flowers . at times , it 's humorous , playful , romantic and emotional . it probably led to a huge duets boom in music in the late '70s as a lot of artists did duets . these days , the term most used is collaborations for these kinds of duets . but it 's a pretty song , one of neil 's best songs since his upbeat '60s pop . diamond 's new album `` 12 songs '' has been selling well and it might get him back on top like he did with these songs on volume 2 .
