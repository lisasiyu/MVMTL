solid this is his weakest attempt but it is still very good and consistent throughout the album . now why is it his worst because it sounds too commercial for me and that is my opinion and other people will say otherwise . i like almost every song here but i skip about 4 of them and the rest i can listen to all the way through . i recommend this album to fans of down south music and maybe rap fans in general but most rap fans probably never heard of him and most are skeptic but i recommend it
