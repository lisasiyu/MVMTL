should be `` madeleine holliday '' if you like the sound of billie holidays , voice you will be floored by the similarity in madeleine peyroux . i hate to say it but her voice sounds almost identical but has more range . the music style is n't totally that old classic jazz sound but similar ; some songs seem tinted with a new orleans sound and some a tiny bit folk-like . over all smooth , delightful songs . not one of them is annoying which is lucky when buying an unknown cd
