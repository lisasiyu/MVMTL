this is the album 80s , 90s and so far have observed a lack of true classic albums , i mean really true classic albums not that one microwaved bands glorified by the rolling stone magazine , mtv and the whole media , just think about it what albums come to your mind when you think or you discuss with your friends regarding classic albums ? beatles revolver ? , any bob dillan work ? , presley sun sessions ? zeppelin ? of course right ? but try to think of any classic album after the 70s and you will have troubles i bet my ass , well , smiths the queen is dead at least is one repply to this matter , because the sober and at the same melancholic mood along with the charming and calm voice of stephen patrick morrisey , the jhonny marr deligthfull strings and beautifull lyrics made not only of `` the queen is dead '' but all smiths albums gorgeous collectible pieces of british contemporary music , elegance and refinement are the basic elements of their music , `` frankly mr. shankly '' is one of my faves , `` i know its over '' , `` the boy with the torn in its side '' you name it ! ! ! ! this album can be easily included into 80s few classics . hm
