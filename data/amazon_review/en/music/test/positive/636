great as usual while stadium-rock dinosaurs like the rolling stones and u2 have been embarassing themselves putting out crappy albums and playing super bowl halftime for years , sonic youth have continued to put out unpredictable , diverse , and all-around excellent abums under the radar . rather ripped continues the band 's recent resurgence , as it contains all of the shimmering , mature ( i hate that word most of the time , but it really does fit here ) beauty that marked murray street and sonic nurse , while containing enough departures to prove the band 's well of ideas is far from dry . thurston , lee and co. have obviously put a lot of effort into ensuring that the band 's sound does n't become calcified , but at the same time this is still unmistakably a sonic youth album , as rather ripped does n't do any cribbing from the countless imitators that have emerged in the wake of the early-'90 's alternative boom . the twin-guitar interplay between lee and thurston is as dense and intricate as ever , but as on the previous murray street and sonic nurse , it 's focused less on rearranging your brains daydream nation-style than on creating warm , inviting tones that mix with steve shelley 's increasingly nuanced and jazzy drumming to create some of the band 's most hypnotic soundscapes yet even as their overall sound becomes more streamlined and accessible ( that 's not to say there is n't still the occasional freakout to be found ; witness the classic instrumental break on the opening reena ) . the band certainly has n't stopped rocking , but they 've somehow managed to do it in a consistently intelligent and sophisticated way even as their catalog has expanded to around the 15-album mark . really , that 's the neatest trick of all in the youth 's 21st-century renaissance-the songs on rather ripped are easily among their most user-friendly , but there 's more than enough attention to detail , and enough individual touches to each track , to keep their more discriminating fans coming back for more . after the merely good reena , rather ripped really takes off , as the next three songs are all among the youth 's best in recent memory , and different enough from each other to show a different facet of their sound at each turn . the catchy , poppish incinerate gives way to the eerily minimal , almost pastoral do you believe in rapture ? before the album skids into more aggressive territory with the thudding backbeats and sneering , vitriolic vocals of sleeping around . between them , these three songs encompass much of what has kept sonic youth relevant well into their third decade of existence , as they all strike a balance between their old status as noise-rock pioneers and their new position as seasoned elder statesman at a time when virtually all of their contemporaries have long since either faded out or imploded . thurston 's vocals have become more self-assured and evocative than ever-even in his quieter moments , there 's a level of confidence and depth that was n't there in the band 's early days . similarly , kim 's vocals have evolved into a smoky , mid-ranged tone that serves her much better than the high-pitched annoyances she used in the daydream nation-goo-dirty era . lee 's obligatory contribution is n't wasted either , as his dark , confrontational rats is another highlight . the hard-driving pink steam goes for five mintues before the first words come out of thurston 's mouth , but vocals or no vocals , the song 's complex arrangements and dense riffage speak volumes on their own . or closes the album on a nicely quiet , contemplative note , with thurston intoning his lyrics in a near-whisper , although it 's not without its share of dissonance in the background . while you could pretty much insert this quote into a review of the band 's last two albums ( in fact , i might have ) , rather ripped once again shows sonic youth expanding their sound into more accessible territory without abandoning the creative drive that made them so compelling in the first place . definitely a worthy pickup , and i for one ca n't wait to see what they come out with next . on another note , i saw these guys live last night in boston , and many of the songs on this album come across even better in a concert setting , so if can catch them , do it . granted , they did make a reference to last night 's show being the conclusion of their tour , so it may be a little late . but whatever , they 're still worth seeing
