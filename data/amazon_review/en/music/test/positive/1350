tapestry - carole king this is a great album ! this is my all-time absolute favorite collection . i have the vinyl lp from the 70s , then later i bought the cassette , and then later the cd - i even have the `` tapestry revisited '' cd ( the tapestry songs re-recorded by various artists ) and coffee mug from several years back . everyone should have this collection on some form
