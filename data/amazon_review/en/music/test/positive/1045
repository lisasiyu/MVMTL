awesome ! ! ! i was born in 1984 , i 'm young i know . but i grew up listening to bands like guns-n-roses , poison , ozzy osbourne , whitesnake , and so on , because of my dad . i grew out of that phase , got in with the boyband thing , until the late 90 's when i re-discovered the great music that was the 80 's . i fell in love with the power ballads , i ca n't begin to explain when listening to a great song like that feels like . its completely awesome , and vh1 has done a great job diggin out the good music and the music that should still be , not the crap they are playing now .
