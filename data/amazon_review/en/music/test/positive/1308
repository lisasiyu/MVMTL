more of the same ( and that 's a good thing ) the music is a bit more polished but the lyrics are just as insightful and intelligent as their previous work . when i stumbled across bite to break skin on a warped tour cd i fell in love and let it enfold you has never escaped my cd changer in my car after 3+ years . this disc is a bit slower than liey , not a knock on them by any stretch , just an observation . gone are subtle references to greek tragedies , replaced by lifes modern trials and tribulations , still as potent as ever . if you do n't know senses fail and are looking for something new to experience , i feel they are a mix of old ataris ( think giving up on love , make it last ) , rufio ( think road to recovery ) , and alkaline trio ( think mr. chainsaw ) . along with those three bands , my musical faves also include bad religion , rise against , tsunami bomb , unwritten law and river fenix ( aka fenixtx ) . as far as i 'm concerned , you ca n't go wrong buying anything from senses fail , they are phenomenally talented . if you get the chance , see them live at a small venue , they never disappoint
