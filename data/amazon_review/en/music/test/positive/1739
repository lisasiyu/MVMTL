yummy a great album . not perfect . the songs themselves are addictive , inventive despite sounding like something you 've heard before , crunchy and sexy . i love how holme 's voice changes from song to song . a great vocalist , which leads me to wonder why eagles of death metal has him on drums and that macho macho man wanabe on vocals . the real star of this album though is the guy who 's not even in the band , dave grohl . his drum playing on this album is incredible . good stuff . get rid of the annoying radio clips and the terrible 6th song and it would deserve a 5/5
