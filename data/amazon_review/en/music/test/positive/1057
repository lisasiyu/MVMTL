quite possibly , the greatest album of all time ... . period as a musician and buyer of well over 2000 albums from every genre , collected over a period of 35 years , this remains my favorite album by anyone at anytime . imho , it is the most `` complete '' collection of songs that anyone has ever committed to vinyl and , given the state of todays recording industry , is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future . an amazing body of work that should grace the collection of anyone who considers themselves a serious music fan
