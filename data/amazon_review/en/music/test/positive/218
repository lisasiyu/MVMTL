murs is top notch . when your drowning in the world of trendy , here today , gone tomorrow rappers ... murs is a breath of fresh air . i like every track on this album , as well as 3:16 . usually i pick up an album , like a few tracks , and listen to the dope tracks and that 's it . i wish it were a little longer , or contained a few more tracks . still a dope album though
