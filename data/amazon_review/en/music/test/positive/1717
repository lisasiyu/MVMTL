vintage joan ! i have the lp of this album and it is almost worn thru ! i decided that if it was available on cd i would get it as a birthday present to myself ! i found this to be one of the best purchases i have made lately . the remastering of the original songs is perfect and the bonus tracks are great ! joan 's voice is still clear and sweet and very easy to listen to . her voice got a more raspy sound on later albums . the bonus tracks were the icing on the cake for me . she covers a wide range of folk songs , from guthrie 's `` ranger 's comand '' to `` rock salt and nails '' by bruce 'utah ' phillips . it is interesting to note that the people who made the labels for the album did not know that there is a substance known as rock salt that is often used in shotguns as a 'varment load ' and therefore list it as `` rock , salt and nails ! '' no matter what you call it i found it to be one of the most haunting songs i have ever heard . all in all , if you like joan baez and/or folk music this is a must have . her version of `` one too many mornings '' brings back vivid memories of the '60s
