i agree - this is great for homesick texans having grown up hearing this album at summer picnics all over the texas hill country during the 1970 's , i had to get this album to take with me when i leave . to me , this captures what live music was like in that area during that time . after having spent many summer nights at places like floore 's country store , gruene hall and cibolo creek , i can certainly feel at home with this album . imagine a warm night with cool breezes , cold beer and crickets ( whose presence is better heard on the cd of this album ... ) . toss in the smell of cedar and live oak with a dash of a musty walls and you 're all set ! this album is not to be taken as a top-notch , pristine live recording of a legend playing his hits and the audience roars with wild applause after each . this is as laid-back as the scene was back then . and this is a fun show . i would like to someday hear an expanded version of this show with any more material that might have been performed that night . then i 'd have to get more beer
