the renaissance of modern music jazz , r & b , rock , soul , funk , and pop music had all existed before 1982 , but when this album came out , it literally combined all the elements and paved the way for what music is today . from recordings to performances to worldwide sales and recognition , jackson set the standards for it all . hundreds of years from now , this will still be looked back on as quite possibly one of the finest albums ever recorded . while quincy maintained his masterful touch on all the recordings , jackson lent his to the timeless compositions of `` wan na be startin ' somethin ' '' , `` beat it '' , and `` billie jean '' , songs that have literally become signature songs of the 1980s , and showed the world just how musical michael could be . aside from those recordings , master songwriter rod temperton ( `` rock with you '' , `` off the wall '' , `` always and forever '' ) and r & b soulman james ingram contributed their own unique tracks , as well . from `` thriller '' to `` p.y.t . `` , every song here literally changed the course of music as a whole . while some have maintained that there are far better albums in music history 's catalogue , i have yet to come across any with as much quality , energy , diversity , and versatility as this one . a masterpiece
