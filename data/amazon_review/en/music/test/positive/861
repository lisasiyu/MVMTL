the comprehensive lenny bruce finally ! the boxed set we 've all been waiting for . lenny bruce was , no question about it , the greatest stand-up comic of all time . he stood alone and unafraid , holding up a mirror to the face of a sick , hypocrtical society that did n't like what was reflected . for this he payed the ultimate price . i 'm not 100 percent crazy about this collection . for the lenny bruce collector there will be disappointments in light of the fact that some of the material has been released before . the booklet that comes with it also contains some eye-popping errors of fact . still , it has alot of pleasant surprises and i reccomend it to anyone who is discovering the genius of lenny bruce for the first time . he once said , `` people should be taught what is , not what should be . all my humor is based on destruction and despair and tomorrow , if the world became tranquil without disease or violence , i 'd be standing on the breadline - right behind j. edgar hoover and jonah salk '' he spoke to us then ; he speaks to us still . tom degan goshen , ny
