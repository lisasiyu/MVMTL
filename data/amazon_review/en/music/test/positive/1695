sumptuous , sexy and sophisticated ! even almost 20 years on this is still one of the greatest recordings ever . musically it has stood the test of time and represents some of the strongest songs bryan ever wrote and recorded . stylistically `` boys and girls '' picks right up where roxy music 's `` avalon '' left off with lush cinematic paeans to the pursuit of love . rhett davies production is sumptuous , warm and oh-so-well suited to bryan 's voice . nothing here rocks too hard and yet it 's still nice mid-tempo jazz inflected numbers with enough beat to pulsate to but yet overall calm subdued and restrained . a good friend of mine jokingly called this the granddaddy of chill out records and they 're not far from it . perfect for coming down from a night of partying or as i call it the `` ultimate make out record '' . and try not to sing along ... i dare you ! there is literally not a dud track in the lot and the music washes over you like waves in the ocean , starting with `` sensation '' and carrying on through . it 's hard to pick personal favorites as they 're all so strong , but `` do n't stop the dance '' is a killer track , especially when bryan coos about `` footsteps in the dark , come together '' . in my humble opinion bryan ferry hands down has one of the sexiest voices ever and this is probably his sexiest recording . `` boys and girls '' is the equivalent of slipping into something more comfortable , taking the phone off the hook , pouring a nice glass of wine , kicking back and doing something you really enjoy
