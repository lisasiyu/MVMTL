the debut of arguably the greatest american rock band ever it was in june of 1972 that classic rock legends the eagles released their self-titled debut album , which was a great blend of pop , rock and country . drummer don henley , bass player randy meisner , guitarist bernie leadon and guitarist/keyboardist glenn frey would finally have the chance to prove to the world that they were musical geniuses whom not only could play well but sing so well with harmonies that were flawless after first playing together in legendary country/rock/pop singer linda ronstadt 's backing band and after they finished the tour with linda she blessed the guys to break out on their own and the band did n't forget her and she subsequently signed to asylum thanks to the eagles ' success . the band has since this debut became the best-selling american band of all time , and is also one of the top 4 ahead of pink floyd and behind only led zeppelin and the beatles . this debut album was produced and engineered by glyn johns , the same man responsible for engineering albums by the who , led zeppelin , the rolling stones , the faces and the beatles among others . the heavily country-influenced take it easy opens this stellar album and was a great intro to the eagles . the rock classic witchy woman follows and was the world 's intro to henley 's voice which would become more dominant in later albums ( he would also sing the rocking nightingale ) . the rocking chug all night follows and has superb vocals from glenn . randy steps out in front for the ballad most of us are sad which is a great song . the aforementioned nightingale follows and is a great rocker . the second half kicks off with guitarist bernie 's country tinged train leaves here this morning and is a great song . the countryish-rocker take the devil is chilling with a great meisner vocal . the country-ish earlybird follows and has bernie on vocals and just is a great number . the slower but still excellent tune peaceful easy feeling follows and was the album 's other hit single . the album closes with the rocker tryin which was one of randy 's best vocal performances . this album has held up well and this was the last eagles album i bought in 1991 when i was 15 on cassette and regretted not acquiring it earlier as i thought the album would stink aside from the three singles which are on the various best ofs ( take it easy , witchy woman and peaceful easy feeling ) . this album is a classic and is highly recommended !
