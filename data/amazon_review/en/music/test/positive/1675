absolute heaven very rarely does jazz give me that wonderful feeling only music can give . i have the best of duke ellington , and a little known group headed by jazz/rock drummer bill bruford called earthwork 's ; they 're o.k . but this album by monk makes me wan na sing , and there are n't even any vocals in it . i think monk is among my favorite tunesmith 's , up there with mozart and prokofiev . that is because no matter how many times you listen to their works you never lose the stimulation or interest for a second
