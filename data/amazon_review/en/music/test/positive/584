what a jam ! while i 'm normally not a huge country fan , i enjoyed this album greatly . the songs had , for the most part , a southern-rock feel , rather than a warbly cowboy tone . the version of & quot ; amazing grace , & quot ; done as a jam session with a huge group of famous musicians , was worth the price of the tape alone ! : c
