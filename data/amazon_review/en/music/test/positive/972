shania twain at her absolute best , great songs too ! this is the first shania twain album that i ever bought and it still sounds as fresh to me as the day i bought it . her personality and gift for singing with real feeling comes across here more strongly than most of her albums . there is a sensitivity , warmth and zest for life that is communicated that is hard to put into words . both the fast and slow songs on this album are very good and the ballads are particularly moving
