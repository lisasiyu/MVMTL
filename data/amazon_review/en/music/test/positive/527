made in china not her best , but still undeniably juliana while this album does n't reach the maturity and beauty of records such as beautiful creature nor does it flaunt the naivety of masterpieces such as hey babe nor does it reach the pop mastery of her recent some girls effort , it delicately floats among the three creating a brief , unwavering expression of true music . made from base emotions and raw vocals and instruments , this is quite a unique juliana record indeed . has juliana become a bit too jaded for her own good ? maybe , but who cares , there are some truly catchy songs on here , such as stay awake . all these angry , grungy , alternative mainstream chick rockers you are hearing now on top 20 countdowns across the world , were invariably influenced by this wonderful songwriter . for anyone else , i might dismiss her often childish lyrics and emotions , but she has proven that she is real the deal , endearing us with her honest feelings more than pushing us away . but these are n't the reasons i 'm telling you to listen to this album , it 's because she is still the juliana we know and love , just a little older and perhaps a little more bitter . she is still the one making us hum her songs at work , on the bus , whereever we may be . she is ornery pop music taken directly and unedited from the heart . i would have loved a few more `` quiet '' songs , but i 'm sure she 'll take care of that on her next album -- think juliana 's pony but way better , all the songs have a harder edge than her last few albums . with each new listen , made in china becomes that much better , revealing a definite evolution of her one-of-a-kind sound . if this is your first time with her , then go back and listen to the beginning ( blake babies on up ) and you can experience an artist that is rewarding and refreshing to listen to
