fat possum primer outstanding sampler from nortern mississippi hill country blues label fat possum . much prefer this sampler to the first one . this has that gritty country blues feel with many songs feeling like they were recorded in a leaky basement ( and many were ) . standouts are the two rl burnside tracks : `` goin down south '' is a staple of his music and the version included of `` walkin blues '' is top notch . the previously unreleased `` i feel good again '' by junior kimbrough and charlie feathers is worth more than the low 4.99 price to buy this . the asie payton tracks are both stunners and paul wine jones and super chikan add some diversity in style with there numbers
