magnificient ! despite the few bad reviews i 've read , i decided to buy the cd and decide by myself . and i do n't regret it . the songs may not be easy to listen , but like any good book or great piece of art are hard to read and understand , if you are willing to get delighted by real music , you 'll get it . there 's lots of talent on this cd . it made my imagination and philosophies fly , made me cheerful , made me sad . my favorite songs : it ; s hard to decide between so many . it brightenly opens with `` no more a-roving '' which , regardless of not containing leonard 's lyrics , he makes of this poem such a song ! ! ! i love to listen to it while in my deck on a clear full moon night . `` nightingale '' lifts up my mood so much and makes me feel so much at home ( specially because i live in the mountains/woods ) and am a nature/wildlife lover . `` the faith '' , just soothes my soul and relaxes me so much that takes me floating to the highest cloud , while listening to it watching the sun set on a cold afternoon ... .but right away i get up and start dancing to the tunes of `` tennessee waltz , which is not out of tune like some reviewer mentioned . here , leonard is singing as imitating a `` country/folk `` singer due to the roots of the song . i love that song too ! in summary : i have to clean my cd , because i had played it over and over , and over and over ... and i think it 's dirty now ... like they said : `` in the repetition you 'll find the taste '' leonard 's voice and anjani 's vocals make an amazing contrast . i give this cd a `` five '' . some may say because it fits my personality . i love contrast . i like being sad and then happy right after . i like to sooth my soul . i like leonard cohen
