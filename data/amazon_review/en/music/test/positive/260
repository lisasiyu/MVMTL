love letter stars - set yourself on fire 5 out of 5 stars to take a cue from the great single that never was , '' elevator love letter '' , from stars ' last under heard/appreciated release , heart . i humbly submit my love letter to stars ' latest magnum opus , set yourself on fire : dear set yourself on fire , you 've got some nerve , coming into my life under the pretense of eletronica and then making me feel something so strong . you grew on me . the last time i felt this way was when i first fell for the beautiful south . your interplay of male/female parts by singers amy millan and torquil campbell is unparalleled now . from the stunning propulsion on your namesake track through the cinematic sensuality of `` the first five times '' , i feel you . i know i 've only known you for a few months , but i feel like we 've been together much longer . i have a massive crush on you . you 're all chill songs , goose bumps and couch dancing fun . you glide into the room with `` your ex lover is dead , but your hopeful closing refrain ( `` calendar girl '' ) is `` i 'm alive ! '' it 's sadly beautiful . you 're an album , a collection of songs that come together to form something greater . taken alone , your songs are great ( `` ageless beauty '' and `` reunion '' ) , but together they are unstoppable . our time together is precious , there 's no wasting it with any clunkers . you 're listenable all the way through , good for driving , headphones , partying and maybe later ... making out ? it 's inspiring , tragic , and heart warming . your strings and horns are hot and the piano , harmonies and glockenspiel are your prettiest eyes . i 'm riding this rollercoaster of mood swings , dancing and tempo shifts . `` i am trying to say what i want to say without having to say ... '' dare i say love , during wartime ? it 's 2005 and we 're alive . you 're the reason i listen to and look forward to new music . you 're my payoff . what are you doing on saturday ? -- - jeff kami
