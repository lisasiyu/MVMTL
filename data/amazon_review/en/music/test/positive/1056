diecast and this album deserves full appreciation first of all , i 'm very disappointed by the people who have given this masterpiece their sad , dry , garbage filled reviews . now getting back to how brilliant this album is . if you are into hardcore/heavy , aggressive music combined with strong , roaring but mature , melodic vocals blended with powerful riffs and drumming , you will love this album ! it 's a mixture of soilwork , shadows fall , dry kill logic and all that remains , which is what makes this album so consistent unlike most noise junk these days that sound all repetitive and gets boring in no time . if you like these bands or their type of music , get this album and feed your ears . every song is absolutely fantastic . my personal favourites ( in order ) are : sacrifice , pendulum and rebirth . the sampling provided on this site is n't really helpful so you may purchase/download these tracks to get a complete idea of how great i mean they are and strong chances are if you are really 'into music ' and not just sticking to the mainstream rubbish , this band is definitely worth giving a try and good reviews for their excellent efforts and hardwork .
