adds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle the first band box-set , `` across the great divide , '' was a disappointing ripoff , so this is long overdue . and it 's also worth the wait ! others have criticized this set for having nothing completists wo n't already have . i disagree . i 've been a serious band fan for about a decade , and there are rarities on here that i 'd never even heard of until now . so for all but the hardest of hardcore fans , this is a welcome surprise . not perfect , but close enough . if the accompanying book is correct , even the band members themselves had forgotten about a couple of the previously unreleased tracks . as for the rest of us , if there 's a mid-60s recording you 've heard of but never heard up to now , chances are it 's here . the 1964 single `` uh uh uh '' / '' leave me alone '' - which was considered `` lost '' a few years ago - is here , and it sounds terrific . all three of the 1965 atco sides are here ( only one , `` he do n't love you , '' was previously available on cd ) . the studio recording of their cover of bobby blue bland 's `` honky tonk '' was an especially nice surprise for me ; i 'd heard an extremely low-fi live recording of it before but did n't know they 'd ever officially recorded it . there are a few surprises among their better-known work as well , notably the newly restored coda in `` to kingdom come . '' what is less satisfying is the selection of previously released tracks . i know no box set is ever going to satisfy all of a given act 's fans , but the previously-released portion of this set seems particularly haphazard , especially the recordings with ronnie hawkins and bob dylan . where is `` high blood pressure , '' the only hawkins single on which robbie , levon , rick , richard and garth all played ? what about the myriad still-unreleased basement tapes that are rumored to exist ? ( there are a few new releases from those sessions here , including a great early version of `` caledonia mission , '' but if the rumors are true it 's still a drop in the bucket . ) and why does every band best-of have to include the supremely overrated `` it makes no difference '' and omit the beautiful `` hobo jungle '' ? minor complaints , i concede , especially since anyone who likes the band well enough to shell out for this collection will probably also have most or all of their original albums anyhow . the dvd is a great addition as well , particularly the saturday night live performances from just a few weeks before the last waltz . seeing the guys play together at that late date is almost surreal for those of us who know , er , the shape they were in , if you will . if you want everything , this will get you close to it , at least
