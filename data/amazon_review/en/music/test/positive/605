we need moore like this ian moores selt titled debut , overall , is his best output , and judging by his new found musical style , will remain so . i could'nt honestly understand all the hoo-haa about the srv guitar similarities . when we are talking about srv clones , we are talking about sunset heights , indigenous , scarlet runner etc . on this debut , there is not one bit of evidence about ripping off srv . none of the songs are straight out blues songs . they are in fact a mixture of rock and soul . ian has now gone on the trek of leaving behind his guitar hero status and concetrating on his fine song-writing talent and his gifted soulful voice . no weak tracks on this cd at all which can not be said about any other ian moore cd . ian 's vocalist heroes all stem round the golden era of rnb with stevie wonder , marvin gaye etc to the fore . you can really feel his emotions when he sings , and this ca n't really be said about srv in the same way . i saw ian at the small prestigeous london club `` the borderline '' on july 4 1994 , and it still rates as one of the best concerts i have seen in my entire life . although i was a little bit disappointed that he didnt include my personal fave on the cd ( i.e . revelation ) , as it was only a 60 min support slot to omar and the howlers . he in fact included 2 or 3 cover versions including `` me and my guitar '' and `` spanish castle magic '' . ian would later appear at wembley arena in support to zz top ( capacity approx . 15000 ) , but the only thing ian had in comparison to la trio grande is that they both hail from texas . a better support slot would have been to bryan adams as an example . ian later went on to write 2 more albums with the original band ( modern day folklore and and all the colors ) , and from those albums came 4 amazing tracks ( today , coming around , time of dying and fickle ) . he would also release a minil live album ( live in austin ) with the original line-up as well which includes 2 or 3 songs from the debut as well as `` me and my guitar '' . i heard a rumour that ian never made it because he was `` too hollywood '' with his pretty boy looks etc . i met ian at the borderline gig , and he was vey humble , calm and polite with no sign of ego or arrogance . i really do hope we get the chance again to hear ian play some real blues music , and let the world know what really could have been . either way , i wish him all the best
