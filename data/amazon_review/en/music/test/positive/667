still great my first exposure to this recording was in a music course in college in the early 60s and i always remembered it fondly , especially the elegy , which is one of the great melodic achievements in all of music . for some reason , this never wound up in my library of vinyl and cd 's , until now . the sound is incredible , easily on a par with many of today 's recordings . but more impressive is the mastery of fritz reiner and the chicago symphony . it 's called concerto for orchestra for a good reason , and the players deliver all the appropriate virtuosity . the taut , driving rhythm , bartok 's great contribution to 20th century music , moves the music forward naturally and inexorably . great stuff and a great model for today 's new generation of conductors and musicians
