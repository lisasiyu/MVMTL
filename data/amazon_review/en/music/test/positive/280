i love the legacy version i am one of the people who got the album when it originally came out . i had it memorized . when it first came out on cd , i was disapoointed . i had noticed that quite a bit of it was cut , especially the bit he talks about before the vsm . however , when i found that the legacy cd came out . i had to buy it . boy , i have not been disappointed . it is great . it is even better because they have added some songs that were not even on the original cd .
