long awaited black & blue and tobacco road it 's very hard for me to be objective about these two recordings by lou rawls and onzy matthews . i wore out my vinyl long , long ago and have been waiting for the cd issue of these records for 20 years . finally ! great and creative big band writing by onzy matthews ... .the arrangements never get in lou 's way and such mature singing for a young guy . lou 's in great voice , the selection of material is first rate and the writing and playing top notch . enough with the cliches ... ... ..buy it..at two for the price of one
