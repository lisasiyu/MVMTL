std rules ! std as in this album that is . it was a key decision to have joey come into play on vocals for the band . his first album with anthrax simply owns you . he has a really awesome vocal range and it always seems to captivate me in every song . he reminds me of bruce dickinson . i certainly agree with a previous reviewer that this album is superior to the highly accredited 'among the living ' ( which does rule as well ) . now i 'll try and give a rundown of the tracks : a.i.r . 10/10 - this song title starts anthrax 's acronym song titles . has a killer riff used throughout most of the song . lone justice 10/10 - this song is awesome since it reminds me of another awesome anthrax track , `` i am the law '' regarding the lyrical theme , however , i actually like this one better . has sweet bass lines that stand out . madhouse 9/10 - has a funny intro with a patient 's maniacal laughing . always reminds me of `` welcome home '' ( sanitarium ) please tell me you know that song , although it 's much more upbeat . s.c.c./stand or fall - 10/10 a thrashing motivational number we have here . anthrax continues to bring forth stellar musicianship and energy . very anthemic . the enemy - 20/10 i do n't know why but i really love this song here . this song definitely needs more praise from everyone . the backup vocals singing `` screams in the night '' is awesome . i think this song is about hitler perhaps ? aftershock 9/10 probably my least fave on the album , not sure why since it does rock pretty hard ... hmmm . oh yeah i does have a really cool solo in it at least . armed and dangerous 10/10 really nice , shall i say relaxing beginning to it then like most thrash songs that start slow , goes into high gear soon after . i also noticed this has some really sick drumming in it too . medusa 11/10 really cool song . `` medusaaaa ! she 's starin ' at you ! ! '' undeniable goodness here . gung-ho 10/10 mighty fine closer we have here . anthrax still maintain the consistency of high energy that was with us the whole album and certainly does n't slow down . if anything , it gets even faster . the beginning kinda sounds like a slayer song in a way , that 's what i think at least . if you call yourself a metalhead , you need to pick up this masterpiece along with among the living , persistence of time , and state of euphoria . you just have to give props to the underrated band of the big 4 of thrash since they were just as talented as the others .
