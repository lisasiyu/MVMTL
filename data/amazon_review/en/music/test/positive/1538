above the rest i think that mario frangoulis is better than josh groban or andrea bocelli . his range is fantastic and his voice is so pure that it just speaks to your soul . he is reminiscent of the three great tenors , carreras , domingo and pavrotti . he is the best of both worlds ... pop and opera . bravo mario
