prince 's hip hop revolution we had already seen an album with hip hop infleunts on `` diamonds and pearls '' from 1991 , this album from 1992 commonly called the symbol or just prince & the power generation is the album where it eventually sounds like a band performing together , and not a semi-solo album like `` diamonds '' . they also go one level further with even more hip hop sound then on any other album . `` my name is prince '' samples his old song `` i wan na be your lover '' among others in the beginning , the song itself is a catchy hip hop infleunted song with both raps and samples . prince also raps here and he 's loud as even before . with lyrics such as `` my name is prince and i am funky , my name is prince the one and only '' it may sound ego-centric but with all the things he 's done and experienced he got the right to . `` sexy m.f '' was a song that the radio did n't want to play cause of it 's explicit lyrics and ( title aswell ) . on mtv is became a massive hit but it was highly censored . it feaurures guitars and classic horns . `` love 2 the 9 's '' is a middle paced slow jam , still with hip hop sound though . `` morning papers '' is anothe ballad , but more relaxed . great lyrics like `` if he poured his heart into a glass , and offered it like wine , she could drink and be back in time for the morning papers '' . `` the max '' is a funky hip hopish number where npg show it 's potential . `` blue light '' is a slow paced song with reggae sound somehow . `` eye wan na melt with u '' is also funky explicit song about sex . `` sweet baby '' is the opposite , a very emotional ballad about love . `` continental '' is a up-tempo song with horns where npg once again show what they got . `` damn u '' is a slow trendy ballad . `` arrogance '' is only 1.35 , and sound more like a funny number then anything serious . `` the flow '' is also a funky song that feaurueres horns , pretty typical for this album . `` 7 '' was one of the biggest hits from this album , a middle tempo odd number that does't really fit in here . `` all 7 and we 'll watch them fall , they stand in the way of love , and we will smoke them all , with an intellect and a savoir-faire '' it 's aparently about a man from the bible that will never grow old . ditto with `` and god created woman '' , a beautiful ballad perfectly suited for a prince album . `` 3 chains of gold '' is midtempo mini-opera that goes on for over 6 minutes , it 's part soulish falsetto and part guitar solo 's . very unique . `` sacrifice of victor '' is a funky song that portrait prince as a civil rights activist and goes back discussing the riots after martin luther king jr 's death . overall , this album is much more focused then the last one and here most songs are either funky hip hop sounding ot smooth ballds . it does n't feel like a solo album anymore and npg get 's much more space then on any other album . the lyrics are exceptionally on point here and the rock opera on `` 3 chains of gold '' is one not to miss . although it was messy there were more natural hit singles in `` diamonds '' though and this `` symbol '' album get 's a little repetitive at times , on the other hand it 's proves that prince was able to melt into the early 90 's hip hop revolution and do it with class . 4/
