hallelujah jaleo ! gypsy soul is the wonderful follow-up disc to narada 's earlier release gypsy passion . together the two discs comprise two of the finest compilations of the `` new flamenco '' style heard anywhere . if anything , gypsy soul is even more eclectic than its predecessor , exhibiting the talents of new flamenco stalwarts like jesse cook all the way across the spectrum to slash of guns 'n ' roses fame . slash 's contribution is a restrained , yet heady melodic instrumental which would stun most of his usual fan base . the disc shows all its contributors to be virtuosos , and the recording style ( rather raw and untouched ) brings out the earthy qualities of new flamenco at its best .
