a really really ! ! ! good album i 'd first heard of lupe fiasco on a track off of kanye west 's album `` late registration '' called `` touch the sky '' i said to myself man this guys good . as 2006 rolls around i kept hearing his first single `` kick , push '' on the radio i knew i had to get this cd when it came out . when i opened it and first played it in my truck oh man it was like opening your first present on christmas day . i could n't stop playing it from `` real '' to `` the emporer 's soundtrack '' and the track that makes you think of the special girl in your life `` daydreamin '' featuring jill scott , this is album you should defiantly add to your collection .
