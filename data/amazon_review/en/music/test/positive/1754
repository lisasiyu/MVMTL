an overlooked gem i 've picked up all of badfinger 's album and this one is the best . my favorite tracks include got to get out of here , dennis , in the meantime , and meanwhile back at the ranch . the production is fantastic - big thanks to chris thomas - and the band is tight ! the guitar ending to meanwhile back is thrilling . the songwriting of the group throughout the album stands head and shoulders above any of the other albums . any potential hit singles to go along with day after day or no matter what ? no , but there 's not a weak song in the whole album . it flows perfectly , pulling you along with its sound , craftsmanship , and melody . what a crime it was for warner brothers to pull it after only 3 weeks ! a definite overlooked gem
