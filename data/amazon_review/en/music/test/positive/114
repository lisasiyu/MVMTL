innovative musical hybrid this cd re-release of their 1981 album has been substantially enhanced by the addition of many previously unreleased tracks . it opens with their masterpiece wheel me out , an eerie and evocative piece with addictive beats and strange interpolations by vocalist liz weiss . the hit title track is a funky rap , where did you heart go ? a mellow soulful ballad with great sax and tell me that i 'm dreaming a complex piece with many samples and unusual vocal arrangements . oh mr friction has a jerky rhythm , meandering saxophones and rap-style vocals , whilst carry me back to old morocco has an innovative instrumental mix and fun lyrics , reminiscent of their james brown song . it 's an attack with its delicious sax patterns is closer to a rock song but with a jazzy edge , whilst the sky 's ablaze is a spoken poem with minimal instrumentation . the additional tracks provide a wider perspective on the virtuosity of this unique band whose music remains hard to categorize . my favorites are christmas time in motor city and the dub version of the title track . the list of vocalists and instrumentalists on this innovative album is quite phenomenal . was ( not was ) certainly contributed to making the early 1980s a very interesting period in popular music .
