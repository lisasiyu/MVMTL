a fine album made better there is an eerie haunting sound to this 4rd album from the band..the production is noticeably slicker , funky horns , the songs juxtapose upon each other unlike the thematic soundscapes found on their 3 prior efforts . if their first album , music from big pink was the soul , their 2nd , the band , the heart , their 3rd , stage fright , raw emotion , then cahoots is the mind..these well crafted produced songs featuring the likes of new orleans legend a. touissant , a great belting van morrison , all add to a fine album worthy of being part of any one 's collection..as a matter of fact , 2 great band classics , their stellar version of dylan 's troubadour gypsy classic `` when i paint my masterpiece '' and the funky `` life is a carnival '' are well worth the 5 stars allotted this review . the eerie vocal mixes throughout , a group somewhat not sounding comfortable but in cahoots with it all..poised for stardom and somehow throwing it all away in their persistence of authenticity is a theme felt throughout these tracks ... the strained guitar chords of robbie robertson , the pain found in danko 's and manuel 's singing , the ever present exuberance of the highs and lows found in levon helm 's voice and the keyboard wizardry of that mad tinkerer garth hudson all add to an album hard to find the likes of nowadays . the band gels and manage to shine in the right places . the extra tracks are all stellar , endless highway , bessie smith , do n't do it..
