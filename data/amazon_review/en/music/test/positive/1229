the reviewers were right-this is beautiful ! i loved the movie , but the music may even be better . my friends think so too , everybody who heard it . look , if you liked the movie 's music , and are reading the reviews to figure out if it is worth buying or not , then take my word for it , it is ! it has all kinds of tracks : mostly chilly and dark , but also some narcotic-sounding slow ones ( good for dancing ) and a few brutal ones . i really recommend it , it is one of the best cds i have . if you are feeling sad , depressed , angry or if you just had enough , this is the music to listen to . buy this , it is essential for your collection
