covenant : my hardcore industrial introduction having listened to fla , delerium and assemblage 23 , i checked on the similar artists listing and came across covenant and was intrigued by this name . i decided to purchase this cd through amazon.com and was impressed by 'dreams of a cryotank ' which stirred pictures in my mind of sci-fic and fantasy ideas . and this music did not disappoint me at all . this is a quite long cd with 12 tracks . track 11 is the extended song called 'cryotank ' and is a masterpiece of elusive industrial beats and sounds mixed with a slow beginning to a explosive end . other songs to look out for on this momentous album are the songs ; 'shelter ' that reminds me of nuclear disaster movies like 'testament ' and 'the day after ' . another good song is the high tempo 'wasteland ' that should make it to dance lists if remixed properly fairly shortly . also check out the bonus song on track 12 'theremin club edit'now that 's a dance song ! a good cd from covenant from 1999 .
