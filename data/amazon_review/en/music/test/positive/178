i wish dylan were young today my favorite song on this record is `` subterranean homesick blues . '' i keep picturing that video in my mind of a very young bob dylan , flipping those cards to the beat of this song . `` 115th dream '' is another song with those great lyrics that only dylan can write . he is certainly a poet , there is no denying that . i love it 's alright , ma . '' but every time i hear the version on this early record , my ears subconsciously hear all the the applause that you hear erupting during the live version on `` before the flood '' when dylan shouts out , `` sometimes even the president of the united states must have to stand naked . '' that song worked then . it works now . we need a young troubador to help us find our way in these troubled times . but , i suppose nobody listened then , so i guess they would n't listen now . still , i 'd like a young dylan today raging against all the injustice that abounds
