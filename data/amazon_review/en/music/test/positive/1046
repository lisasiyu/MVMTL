wonderful music another review of a govi cd that i should have submitted years ago . this cd opened my ears and mind to a whole new spectrum of guitar based music that caused me spend big $ $ $ $ to upgrade my mid-fi stereo system to high end ; a decision that i 'll never regret . maybe better than any other govi release , this cd showcases the widest range of his immense musical talents . the softly played songs are full , detailed , open , and introspective while `` viva la vida '' makes me feel like i am riding a galloping horse , in the southwest desert , at full speed while enjoying a day of playing hookey from work . the end result of this fullfilling music is not only the great sound but the warm/happy feelings that the music generates . george m -- phoenix , az
