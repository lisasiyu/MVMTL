takes my breath away this disc is merely further proof of what the world already knows . yo yo ma was in fact born to play the cello , it is simply fantastic . it is a must own for me , it feels the air around you with such wonderful tones . although some classical snobs might complain that this is nothing more than a pseudo classical album , who cares . they should find the nearest emergency room and have someone remove the poles from thier *sses . no apologizes are needed hear , this disc is all that it needs to be , which is absolutely magnificient ... ... . peace : the*hot*wax*ki
