dolphy and the european excursion for this dolphy fan , last date stands the test of time as one of his finest performances . recommended to any jazzcat into 60 's avant . dolphy explodes on bass clarinet on his version of monk 's classic , epistrophy . dolphy , epistrophy ... hmmm ? the drum and bass work is nothing special but the scandanavian team does the job . the piano player ( also scandanavian ) is a nice surprise with interesting melodic and rhythmic chord placements . all in all , one of dolphy 's best and one to go back to time and time again for new insights . there 's even a quote from eric after the final track . a must buy for anyone who says they 're seriously into jazz
