no excuses ... .add to cart asap ! ! ! if you 've made it this far and are a dictators fan , shame on you for even needing a review to convince you to buy this ! are you hesitating because of the price ? how much have you spent on dictators albums in the last 25 years ? maybe you 're hesitating because you 're concerned about terrible sound or a lousy performance . well , the sound is suberb ( a great production job by shernoff ) and the performance flat out rocks . ( i 'd like to add ... ..this is not ipod music . this is 200 watts a channel and at least 10 '' woofers to move some serious air music ) . the major bonus here is the killer versions of the `` go girl crazy '' songs . even the remastered version of the studio album leaves much to be diesired . the songs on this live album finally do those 25 year old tracks justice . satisfied ? so add it to cart now or go to zshops and save a few cents . if you 've made it this far on curiosity & your music collection is lacking in the dictator 's department , this album is the album to get . `` viva ! '' is a great representation of what this band is all about . after one listen you 'll be adding all the studio releases to your collection fairly quickly . i only have a few minor `` issues '' to bring up . so , if you are not a fan of the band already , just skip my ranting below , buy the cd and come back to read this later . ok ? the below may be considered blasphemy and i may burn for it . but i need to get them off . the only beef i have about the sound is the imbalance in the guitar mix . ross 's guitar in the right channel is set on about `` 10 '' while top ten 's guitar in the left channel is set on about `` 7 '' ; and this is a very picky , long time fans criticism . second , this is not a true live album per se rather than a collection of live songs . songs put together with very little between song chatter and audience participation . some songs actually fade out to silence . all this gives the album more of a `` live in the studio '' than audience live recording feel . the last song `` cars & girls '' was recorded at an audience free sound check and sounds no different than the rest of the album . i was really hoping to hear a few between song sermons from manitoba and it was not to be . lastly , no music from `` manifest destiny '' . this may be a contractual issue however and not an oversight by the band . but the one thing that overshadow 's all my nitpicking is ross the boss . if you have all the albums on vinyl , then you know where i 'm coming from . ross 's playing here blends the ferocity of the stooges james williamson with the melodic playing of `` buck dharma '' with a little bit of ace frehley thrown in . he 's never , never , never , never , never sounded better . that 's it ... .
