great follow up to an excellent debut wonderful band out of poland . i do have a few minor detractions to this album ( as well as their last one ) ; 1 ) i think with a little bit better mix and master these guys could really break very well into north america . 2 ) i could easily do without the opening 35-40 sec . of whispering . if the album had started right away with the beautiful a-capella that is the opening track `` after '' , easily could 've developed a much more receptive mood from the listener imo . highly recommended .
