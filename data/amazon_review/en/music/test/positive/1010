ethereal this is morricone at the height of his career . here he created a score as mysterious and ethereal as the jungles and waterfalls depicted in the film `` the mission . '' using a combination of flutes , oboes , strings , choral and other odd wind instruments , morricone created both a unique and haunting experience that will leave you spellbound long after the last notes have faded from the air . the score could almost be classifed as a requiem , in this case a tribute to a people that are gone ( the guarani natives depicted in this film who were long ago driven from their homes ) and the jesuits who gave their lives to protect them . from the opening scene of the film , the score announces itself as the dominant character in the narrative , taking us from the lonely plight of a missionary on a cross , to the streets of colonial asuncion , to the mist shrouded rain forest above the falls and the fateful mission where lives and beliefs will be tested to the core , combining native motifs with deep and sweeping string movements to fill in the places in the story where actors and the dialogue are silent , allowing the music to bring us down into an intimate place of reflection where we can embrace the sadness and the transformation that this film evokes . the only piece that i can compare this work to is richard strauss ' `` death and transfiguration , '' both works leave me shaken and nearly moved to tears . however , it 's a deeply rewarding feeling to come in contact with works as profound as these . buy `` the mission '' and you will find yourself instantly transported to a place as rare as the bygone world the film depcits .
