compare this to stand up ... compare the two albums by dave that get the most negative reviews , and it 's like heaven and hell . this is a mfing amazing album next to stand up . i really do n't understand the disillusionment by all these dave matthews fans over this cd . there are some pure golden songs on it , and like any other album , there are some not so great ones , but this at least still sounds like dmb . i never had any doubts about this cd until i started reading such negative reviews . i went back and listened a little more critically , and i still stand my initial impression . not his strongest , but still an acceptable album
