the power and glory of the huskers if iggy pop helped , as he has claimed , `` to wipe out the 60s , '' bob mould , grant hart and greg norton then helped to bring it back . that is , this band managed to expand upon the musical/emotional/cathartic possibilities in high speed hardcore by drawing upon 60s ( and 70s ) psychedelic and hard rock influences . for instance , elsewhere , the band cover such iconic 60s performers as donovan ( sunshine superman ) and the byrds ( eight miles high ) . and like the who 's quadrophenia lp , this too appears to be also a concept album about a young man 's alienation from the world around him . here , such influences abound . for example , dreams reoccurring 's psychedelic guitar freak out is followed by the absolute hardcore pounding of the great indecision time . hare krishna - based on the street chant by the well known western hindu cult - then combines the hardcore , the psychedelic , and the religious even ; just listen to mould 's crazy and unbelievable guitar playing on it . and then , a few cuts later , the song pride . you can practically envision the band levitating off the floor of the recording studio , and it demands that you turn the volume way up , and maybe blow out a window or two to your house , till your neighbors come over , screaming at you to turn down the noise . and this you can not do , as you are caught up in a husker du trance . such is the power of this 1984 masterpiece . this then was the record that made me a huge fan of this group , and i will always be convinced that this remains one of rock 's classic recordings by one of its all time greatest bands . i have mixed feelings about the idea of a rock and roll hall of fame , but given that it exists to enshrine the greats of rock history , i predict that one day husker du will be enshrined there , and deservedly so . current day punk bands , i challenge you all to do anything half as raw and intense as this , i absolutely challenge you !
