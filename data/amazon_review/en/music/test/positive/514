hands-down classic hip-hop album from the first few bars , this album grabs you by the throat and does n't let go . it 's a little abstract , and might take a few listens to grow on you , but it 's the perfect meld of classic hip-hop beats and robot-march production . after this album , el-p 's tracks got a little distracting , to me at least , but `` the cold vein '' blends seamlessly . the lyrical tag-team work of vast aire and vordul is also something to marvel at . dense , dense poetics , with metaphors and symbolism crammed into every verse ; they often sound like they 're cursing , even though they 're not . in the first cut , `` iron galaxy , '' vast paints a bleak picture of new york that sets the gritty tone for the rest of the album : `` let 's talk in laymen 's terms/rotten apples and big worms/early birds and poachers/new york is evil at its core/so those who have more than them/prepare to be victims/ate up by vultures/politicians in a dog-eat-dog culture/that 'll sic 'em . '' throughout the album , a dark , violent undercurrent runs through each song , from the syncopated `` vein '' to the angelic stomp `` a b-boy 's alpha '' to the brilliant closer , `` pigeon . '' of course , it 's not for everybody . there is not one club-ready beat on the whole lp , and those who are going from the window to the wall will probably miss a lot of the clever one-liners and metaphors , but real heads recognize , and `` the cold vein '' is something a lot of mc 's could learn from
