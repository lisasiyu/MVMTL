amazing young singer , hard to believe someone so young can sing like this ! i had to respond to a comment made previously ; `` another standout moment is her duet with peter cincotti on neil sedaka 's `` breaking up is hard to do . '' cincotti is clearly the superior singer here ; he does piano here as well . '' cincotti does have a very nice voice , and when he begins the song one is immediately impresses with his voice . unfortunately , renee then chimes in and like a cat dancing with a pig , she trounces his vocals . he simply is out classed by this little girl ! like sinatra , cincotti has a nice voice , but he seems even more limited than sinatra in his range . sinatra was a fantastic singer , but he know what he could or could not sing , and concotti is likewise challenged . in contrast , renee seems capable to singing anything ever written with the style of the greats such as ella , and lena horn while also having the strength of voice of say ronstadt , and streisand . she may not be quite opra ready yet , but i did say may not , as she darn well may be ready . at this age perhaps charlotte church had a stronger voice , but she certainly lacked the nuance which is needed for jazz , and which young renee has in abundance . i good friend of mine who worked closely with bands like huey lewis and the news , earl scruggs , etc . quickly picked up on her youth when he heard her sing , most would not i suppose , but he was stunned at her ability . the cd is not perfect , there are flaws , but as a package it is one heck of a musical ride this little girl takes you on ! last year i was hearing stories about her next cd out of hollywood , but so far nothing . i just hope she stays with jazz as i think it is the only formate where she can really demonstrate the full extent of her enormous vocal talent . i am very anxiously awaiting her next cd
