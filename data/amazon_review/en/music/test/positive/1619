fantastic ! i saw leahy in concert at milwaukee 's irish cultural center . the experience is beyond words . we were clapping , yelling , and dancing in our seats ! that prompted me to buy their first album and i was not disappointed . the musicianship is terrific and the selection unbeatable . i 've listened to it many , many times and it never grows old . thanks leahy !
