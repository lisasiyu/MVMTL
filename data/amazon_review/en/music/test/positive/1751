the album trivium wish they made instead of crusade this band got it right for creating good modern metal . trivium 's new album crusade failed in this respect since trivium lost their agression and just sold out to melody . this album has the right mix of aggression and melody . the guitar breakdowns are interesting , the vocals are very good another good mix of aggressive screamo and timely melodic chorus .
