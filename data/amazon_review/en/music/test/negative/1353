oh my ! ! when i heard the song `` i wo n't stand in line '' i thought to myself ... neither will i ... meaning `` i wo n't stand in line '' to buy any of this lady 's music ! ! this cd has some of the worst songs i 've ever heard in my life like the one above , `` i would n't wan na be you '' , and `` everything you want '' . `` why have n't i heard from you '' gets on my last nerve ! ! there really is not much redeemable about this release . its got a nice cover with a flattering picture of reba on the front of it but that 's about it ! ! read my mind ... .it stinks !
