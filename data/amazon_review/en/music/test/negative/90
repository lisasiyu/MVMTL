an alternative view this came out when i was 12 : it would have been far too 'difficult ' an album for a young whippersnapper and i was only vaguely aware that the bunnymen existed at that time . in my early teens i bought a few bunnymen singles and ocean rain ; now , 24 years later , i 'm trying to fill in the rest of the bunnymen jigsaw . after a week of repeated listening , i 'd say you can try on this album in either of two ways . either , you judge it by its stand out songs , which are far and few between : if you can listen half a dozen times and manage to hum more than 2 tunes afterwards , you 're doing better than me . alternatively , you can put it in context : appreciate that this was a pretty original approach at the time and marvel at the uncanny proto-u2 sound , ( which i have to say does precious little to endear it to me ) . if you 're interested in exploring music history largely for its own sake , it 's worth hearing in order to understand how we got from joy division to u2 within a couple of years . however , if like me you think both joy division and u2 are vastly overated , this really is n't going to do much for you . it 's determindly bleak , which is not necessarily a bad thing , but this also captures the bunnymen at a stage before they got a knack for melody : only 'over the wall ' and 'a promise ' deliver a decent hook . i 've seen heaven up here described as a work of 'rare beauty ' . it can also cause a tense , nervous headache . if you 're interested in the early 80 's british underground scene , then of course you should hear it , along with the other bunnymen albums . compared to the lush scott walker-esque ocean rain , though , this is half-baked and less than half-rewarding .
