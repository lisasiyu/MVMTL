great single , just not a great album most upsetting about port of miami is that being a big fan of the organ-filled `` hustlin ' '' , i was hoping that quality-wise the entire album would stand up to that brilliant for single . unfortunate for the somewhat fortunate debut ( # 1 on the billboard 200 with 187,000 copies sold ) , the album to put it bluntly stinks . sure `` hustlin ' '' along with a generic repeat of young jeezy 's massive `` soul survivor '' hit ( `` cross the line '' which features nobody else by konvikt akon ) , are fine , but otherwise , ross has more inhabitions than attributes . while idealy ross should compete with new standouts such as southern rapper young jeezy or t.i. , or even more less known names such as slim thug or bun b , he does n't make the cut against any of those artist . in fact , ross 's gravely vocals tend to grate rather than inspire , all except on the opening tracks such as the above par `` push it '' , `` hustlin ' '' , `` cross the line '' , or `` i 'm bad '' . otherwise , ross unfortunately falls on death ears . it makes you wonder that if ross were to ever release a sophomore album , would it be successful ? with such boasts made of him by diddy and jay-z , mega hip-hop stars and talent-searchers , you wonder who dropped the ball with the excution of this star 's album , which is terrible to say about any new artist . and without a true single tall enough to stand against the incredible but minor radio cut ( it never did really well despite fan support ) `` hustlin ' '' , you wonder if after an impressive debut and support if the only way for ross is down instead of up ? no , i 'm not putting ross down , but i ca n't help but to say that i was expecting a meatier , grammy worthy debut from ross instead of the rather hit-absent port of miami . does he rep good for miami ? sure , but hopefully a second round will make ross more mature and more likeable than a rather bland debut . 2 stars for the album , 4.5 for killer single `` hustlin ' '' , a sure to be rap classic
