not very good at all i 'm a huge sinatra fan , but this is a weak brew . sinatra phones it in ( literally - he was n't even in the same room with his duet partners ) , and few of the guests offer anything of value . this is a marketing ploy , not an album - get any of the great capitol releases from the 50s and learn why sinatra was the entertainer of the century..
