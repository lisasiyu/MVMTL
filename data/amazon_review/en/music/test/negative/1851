not very impressive when i heard that laura powers was simular to loreena mckennit i rushed to get this cd . i was very disappointed . laura powers has a lovely voice and the songs are good , but she ca n't compare with loreena mckennit and enya . she lacks enya and loreena 's surrealistic sound and loreena 's incredable instrumentation . when you listen to enya you feel like you have passed part way into the otherworld . when you listen to loreena you feel like you have stepped back into the ancient world of mystics , shamens and exotic lands . laura , although her music is soothing , provides no enchantment . overall i would not recommend this cd to anyone
