the best of ? not really . this album does n't offer `` the best of scooter '' only the best after 1998 . all the previous singles like `` move your ass '' `` back in the uk '' `` fire '' and `` the age of love '' are not present here . it 's a allright album for starters but personally i think that the music they made from 1994-1999 was the best and many of those songs are not here , while lots of newer one 's that does n't offer you the true sound of scooter that are here are n't very good . i own `` rough & tough & dangerous : 94-98 '' that does include some of the classics and it also offers you some wonderful instrumental trance songs that really proves the genius of this band ( we do n't see that very often anymore though ) . while songs like `` how much is the fish '' `` i 'm your pusher '' `` call me manana '' and `` we are the greatest '' are all great songs you can find them on `` no time to chill '' instead , other then that , get the album i recommended instead of this that is n't really their `` best of '' anyway
