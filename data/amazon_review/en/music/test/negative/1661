a selection -- -we need a complete set of all they did . the searchers are still touring and i saw them last year in bay shore , new york state . this album here is fine , but the group 's work is much more worth getting into . we need the biggest most complete set possible . it is hard to get new listeners to hear some of their best songs : the world is waiting for tomorrow , lovers will , all a dream , till i met you , and so many more . buy this if it 's the best in your price range and then join the groups on the web where you can expand your searchers appreciation ! and do n't forget to read frank allen 's memoir of the group 's history . it 's fun
