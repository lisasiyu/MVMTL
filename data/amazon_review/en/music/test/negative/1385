i love brian setzer 's orch. , but ... setzer and his band are sizzlin ' hot , and he is my favorite swing band leader , however no matter how many times i try to listen to this cd , i just ca n't bring myself to like it . it is just too darn hokey , cheezy , commercial , and corny . in the mood is full of energy , and could have been great without the `` dj mix '' club beat intro , and i find the rapping offensive racially . it sounds as though they are making fun of the rap genere , and mocking the race . setzer 's vocals never sounded better and hsi guitar playing is great , and band is smokin . the sonsg americano sucks , and the production value in nill , zero , nana , it 's way overproduced . buy hsi new live 2 cd set instead..
