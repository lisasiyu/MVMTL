do n't buy the century media version ! ! ! ! an excellent release ... . just do n't buy this version . the century media release with the bonus tracks contains audio that appears to have gone through some kind of lossy audio encoding process ( i.e . encoded to mp3 then back to pcm ) before being sent to the manufacturing plant . avoid this one , check out the other versions and make sure you receive the full audio spectrum that you paid for .
