a mix of old and new ... more new this sounds a lot like 'out of time ' , but not quite as good in some respects . 'pop song 89 ' is a perfect opening to the album , it moves along nicely and is pretty catchy . other highlights include 'world leader pretend ' , with nice percussion and steel guitars . there are three acoustic songs which began kind of a theme on the next couple of albums . 'you are the everything ' to me has absolutely no melody and moves along rather boringly . 'the wrong child ' attempts to utilise harmony vocals . they are completely out of key with each other . another poor effort . the high 'okayyyy ' parts are unbelievably out of tune . 'hairshirt ' is third cut in the same vein as the previous two . same chordal structure without much melody going on anywhere . clearly , the ballads needed to be perfected . 'orange crush ' is a more catchy tune . mike mills can also be heard in the chorus and , at the risk of sounding controversial , he actually has a better voice . much purer . why he did not sing any lead until the next album , is just unbelievable . probably the strongest track . the best way of summing up this album is that it consists of three types of songs ... 1 ) the pop songs - pop song 89 ( good ) , get up ( ok ) , stand ( rubbish ) , the bonus cut ( ok and catchy ) 2 ) the ballads - mentioned above , all rubbish . 3 ) the rock songs - world leader pretend ( good - toes line of being a ballad also ) , i remember california ( grundgy , not too bad ) , orange crush ( very good ) , turn you inside out ( rubbish
