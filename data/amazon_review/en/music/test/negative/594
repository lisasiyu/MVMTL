alright , if you absolutely have to have a garfunkel solo album ... this one is for you . but honestly now , the guy does n't write -- beautiful voice -- but songwriting is a major appeal . so guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above justin timberlake . ok , there are definitely highlihgts like a heart in newyork , ( what a ) wonderful world , but generally this a very casual compilation , good for a couple listens . in general , art garfunkel is n't really good for more than that . check out him witht paul simon , that is amazing stuff , but this is kinda boring . i might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs -- but even though there are good songwriters writing for him , the songs are still sub-par
