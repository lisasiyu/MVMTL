among the most forgettable of part 's oeuvre this ecm disc contains four works from the late 1980s and early 1990s by estonian composer arvo part , performed by the estonian philharmonic chamber choir and the tallinn chamber orchestra conducted by tonu kaljuste . starting in the mid-1970s and continuing through the era of these recordings , part composed in a style he called `` tintinnabuli '' for its bell-like tones . the austereness of the music and the religious titles of many of his works have earned this genre the name `` holy minimalism . '' these four pieces i found these to be the most forgettable of part 's works . `` te deum '' ( 1984-1986 ) , dedicated to the music publisher alfred schlee , is the oldest piece here . at almost 29 minutes , it is also the longest . a setting of the well-known latin hymn , `` te deum '' combines choral moments with some striking passages for strings . while i do n't care to return to it often , the piece is for me the high point of this otherwise dismal collection . `` silouans song '' ( 1991 ) is an instrumental work inspired by the poem of st silouan the athonite which begins `` my soul yearns after the lord and i seek him in tears . '' it is unmemorable music , sounding like a film score , and covers no interesting ground in its five minutes . `` magnificat '' ( 1989 ) , a ghostly a capella setting of mary 's words after her visitation by the archangel gabriel , is similarly disappointing . `` berliner messe '' ( 1990-1992 ) simply baffles me . with a theme like the mass , one should produce something grand and moving ; simply look at what mozart did with his several masses or , among contemporary works , ligeti in his requiem . instead , part gives a dull , lifeless , and barely-audible work that has few redeeming qualities . the `` berliner messe '' was revised in 1996 , and that version can be found on the recent naxos disc . the booklet contains the text of each of the choral works , along with translations into german , english , and french . it also has many photos of the beautiful lohja church in finland where the pieces were recorded . however , like the rest of the part releases on ecm , there is no biography of the composer or musical analysis , a phenomenon i am beginning to get fed up with . i have generally been hard on part 's work during this period for lacking any real orthodox sincerity , though his passio of 1982 stands as an important exception . part really hit his stride during the mid-1990s , when he began to broaden his style and use elements from his eastern orthodox faith , a time when he produced his magisterial setting of the `` kanon pokajanen '' pentinence text of st andrew of crete . his tintinnabuli works could at best be called merely entertaining instead of truly insightful . however , the pieces represented here are not even that . if you have never heard the work of arvo part before , i 'd recommend getting the litany or kanon pokajanen discs or , if you want to hear music from his tintinnabuli phase , the tabula rasa disc , all of which are also on ecm . this te deum disc is best left to completists
