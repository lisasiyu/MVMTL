a baby band ... ... ... ... ... ... . the cars were one of the most annoying , dumb , pathetic , lame , overrated , stupid , lousy , and awful bands ever came out in the 70 's . their lead singer ric ocasek sings horribly and sings like a baby . this greatest-hits album was a huge joke that each and every song is incredibly bad . their guitar playing is really bad . they are only recommended for loosers . do n't listen to the five star reviewers of this album and avoid cd 's from the cars , nirvana , and ac/dc who suck . listen to good bands like foreigner and dire straits insted . ps.the cars are for babies ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
