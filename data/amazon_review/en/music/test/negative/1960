supposed former alanis fan supposed former infatuation junkie is one of the most eccentric albums to have been released in the 90 's . nobody can dismiss it as a complete failure because it genuinely does have its moments . but then of course there are songs like `` front row '' or `` one '' ( to name just a few ) that are shamelessly self-indulgent and should never have been released to the commercial public . the problem with alanis , is that she has never been able to leave some things to a listener 's imagination . what helped `` jagged little pill '' become one of the ten best-selling albums of all time in the united states is that the lyrics were personal , but generic enough to still spark the fascination of listeners . in the case of `` supposed former , '' the lyrics are painstakingly overwritten well beyond the point of gratuitousness and rather than follow a coherent format , they meander . this sort of no-holds-barred lyrical approach suits certain songs -- '' baba , '' `` thank u , '' `` the couch , '' and `` so pure '' at least adhere their obscure lyrics to a structured melody . if all art is valid , then everyone should have a painting hanging up in the louvre , but the sign of a true artist is one who can temper their artistic integrity in a manner that engages others . `` jagged little pill '' was a catchy , poignant , emotive masterpiece that struck a nerve with tens of millions of people . `` supposed former , '' on the other hand , is far too self-involved and should have remained in the pages of alanis ' diary ; where such clumsy , wordy , overreaching attempts at poetry belong . unfortunately , this killed whatever momentum `` jagged little pill '' had created and permanently closed the door on alanis for tens of millions of fans
