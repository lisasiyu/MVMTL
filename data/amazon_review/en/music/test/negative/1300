i 'm still laughing this cd is great- as a gag gift . this is a redundant piece of s**t , and i am still laughing at the amazingly cliche ' lyrics . escape the fate is like a bad from first to last cover band ... the lead singer sounds almost exactly like sonny moore . this is proof that the wold is going to hell . for good emo/screamo , pick up from first to last 's `` heroine '' and atreyu 's `` the curse ''
