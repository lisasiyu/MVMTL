shut up and play ! eric johnson is as talented a guitar player as god ever put on this earth . his chords and notes are so clean , it defies belief . you wonder out loud how someone could master an instrument as well as he does . growing up in austin , i have had the chance to see him numerous times , and my opinion of him has not changed in 20 years , he ca n't sing ! i am sorry , but eric has always had this desire to be a pop star . so many people in austin just cringe at concerts when he stops rocking , so that he can sing one of his sappy lyrics . it is a waste . now do n't jump on me ! i love the guy ! but i wish he would stick to playing guitar and quit the singing . the guy just has so much talent
