fun , but not appropriate for kids - violent lyrics this cd is fun and musically intriguing , but not appropriate for kids ... one song talks about `` what can you do in a case like that but stamp on your mother , and your toothbrush , and on everything that 's helpless . '' another talks of being an immigrant to the country and says `` and they beat me , and they banged me , and they left me on the ground . '' and another says `` i 'm a great sharpshootress . there is nothing that i ca n't shoot in the eyes , or the ears , or the teeth , or the fingers . '' musically it 's fun and goofy and intriguing , but i was appalled when i realized what i was encouraging my young child to listen to .
