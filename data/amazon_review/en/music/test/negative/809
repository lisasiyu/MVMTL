bad bad b-a-d i 've ordered the collection with one thought in mind : ohh boy ! a good irish collection . i was astonished to hear synthesized ( ! ) music instead of the real instruments - no violins here , no bagpipes , no flutes ! only synthesized music ! this collection had much potential but it was killed ! not to mention the annoying rain sounds . ok - their nice for starts but they dont stop all thru the album and sometimes the music gets engulfed in them totaly . bad
