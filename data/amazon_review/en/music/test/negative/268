buy kelly 's album instead of this i never got through listening to this whole album ... i bought it because i was a fan of kelly clarkson and justin guarini - but just hearing the first few minutes of kelly 's version of respect , i lost interest . i do n't recall ever putting the cd in the cd player after that time . so if you like kelly and justin , buy their albums instead
