incomplete soundtrack it would be nice , as a couple of other reviewers stated , to have included some of the `` score '' as well as the songs and arrangements already present . i was hoping their would be a bit of that when i ordered it . the songs are good but did n't warrant listening to the cd more than a couple of times
