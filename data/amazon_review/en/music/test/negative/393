not the way to experience 311 i used to be a rather large 311 fan due mainly to the comparisons to sublime . they are pretty good in my book but i must say , this cd is a weak compilation ... one has to understand..each of the albums represents a different 311 universe . being reduced to 2-4 songs off of each album mushed together on one gets old very fast . start out with transistor or soundsystem if your into reggae-ish sounds..if your into rap rock..go with grassroots and blue album . this cd is a rip off and a cheapened 311 experience
