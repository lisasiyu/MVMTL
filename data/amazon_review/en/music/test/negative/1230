r.i.p . dime i have nothing but the upmost respect for vinnie paul . it eats me up that he chose this project as his comeback to music . i ca n't think of a musician that would n't have jumped at the chance to be in a band with him . ( zakk wylde , maynard james keynan , hell even matt heafy are a few names that come to mind ) i respect what mudvanye does . they have a formula . not exactly my cup of tea , but it works and it sells records . so why this collaboration ? why now ? i ca n't figure it out . glen tribot and ( insert nothingface guitarist name here ) are not even in dimebag 's shadow . their riffing does n't do vin 's playing any justice and it shows right off the bat . the only part of this album where i hear any real connection is when vinnie is playing the snare and high hat in 4/4 . terrible waste of such an amazing talent . as for the vocals ... some of the screaming works , nothing special , just kinda sounds like mudvayne . but on the slower country influenced songs , i fight every urge to smash this cd into a million pieces . vinnie paul , please find yourself musicians at your skill level and leave the amaeturs in your wake ... if you like mudvayne and enjoyed damageplan ... you will still probably be disapointed with this cd . if you are expecting pantera , as some of these reviews will lead you to believe.. well go throw on trendkill and feel privelaged that you were able to experience metal at its finest .
