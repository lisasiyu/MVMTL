expecting great memories , but what did i get ? i ordered this release last week from amazon and could n't wait to hear it , but when i got it yesterday , i opened up the cd and when the player read the info on the cd , instead of getting 15 tracks of music like i was promised , i got 10 tracks and 44 minutes of spanish ballads ! oh , my lord , what in the world happened ! ? well , i guess you ca n't hear 'em all , can ya ? i 'll just be sending this disc back to where it came from and just hope for the best next time . oh , by the way , the one star is not for the flirts music , for that is 5 star material anyway , but just for the shoddy mishap that occurs when you get everything in its package except for the right music
