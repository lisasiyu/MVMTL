i wish i could rate zero stars i bought this cd last friday and knew i had made a mistake within 30 seconds of the 1st song . i only made it through the 4th track before removing it from my cd player and returning to the store to exchange it . i can respect complex time changes , but being good at math does not make for good music . i heard nothing that could be considered a melody and also nothing that sounded like actual instrumental talent . they may know how to play their instruments , but they do not know how to play . also , the production is terrible . the praise of this album strikes me as some kind of joke . it 's that bad . if you want to listen to instrumental rock/metal made by talented muscians who know how to play and write music that is not painfull to listen to , check out gordian knot `` emergent .
