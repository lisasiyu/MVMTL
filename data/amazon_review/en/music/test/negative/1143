i had to buy it to believe it ... . ... but it 's true . sammy 's gone country . there are 2 maybe 3 tracks on this whole album that are any good . my taste in music is very broad with one exception - country . if i had to name one rock icon of mine , it would be sammy and ... sammy ... you really let me down with this album . it pains me to say so , but i ca n't recommend this album to the classic hagar rock fan
