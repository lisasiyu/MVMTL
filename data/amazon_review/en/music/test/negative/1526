one of elvis ' best camden albums on cd for the first time ! ... but with a few changes ... i always liked this lp , because it included some un-released studio and soundtrack recordings that had never been released before this lp first appeared in 1970 . however , there have been a few slight changes in the cd version , which were kind of dissapointing . the song `` mama '' , which is an out-take from elvis ' movie `` girls ! girls ! girls ! , is not the 2:12 mono version from the original lp ... it is the 58 second , stereo version that was first included on the `` double features '' series . this shorter version was probably included because of the better sound quality and the fact that it is in stereo , although the actual reason is not quite clear . the shorter version is actually the original , the way elvis actually recorded it . the longer version is spliced from elvis ' version and the amigios version , which was probably done at the same session . this is the version that was used in the film , and elvis probably liked it enough to record a version of his own ... probably as a tribute to his mother . it is also possible that it was originally intended for the film , but never used . the other change here is with the song `` let 's forget about the stars '' . the version included on the cd is the same take as the one on the original lp ... however , the lp version included a piano track that is missing from the cd . again , the cd includes the stereo version that was included on the `` double features '' series , probably because the original lp included the song in mono . it 's possible that the master , which included the over-dubbed piano track , has been lost . still , this cd is not a complete dissapointment , because the versions of these two songs included here are still very good . my only complaint would be that this version of `` mama '' is much too short , and this lp only included 9 songs and had a short running time to begin with . these original camden albums on cd are selling for only about 5.99 , so at least they are not over priced , which makes them well worth purchasing . still , anyone who has waited for this cd to get the versions of these two songs as they were released on the lp will be a bit dissapointed
