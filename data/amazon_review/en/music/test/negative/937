wakes you up instead this cd was supposed to be soft , easy music that would help you go to sleep . i did go to sleep almost immediately but not because of the music -- i was just very tired . however , the music actually woke me up a couple of times when it got just a little louder . maybe it 's me , but i did n't find this product to do as promised .
