musically weak - later work is far stronger having really enjoyed 'you 've come a long way baby ' - one of my favorite albums - i had high hopes for this work , after all , they are just a year or two apart . oh , was i disappointed . perhaps if one were thrashing around at a rave party while out of their gourd on x , then this album would sound a little better , but stone cold sober i really had a hard time with this ensemble . the constant looped samples just repeat and repeat seemingly , in some instances , for ever . i see this album almost as a test case for cook 's later - and musically far better - work . one can really see the roots here of how this style and sound was massaged and refined into something much more musically coherent with 'you 've come a long way baby ' . song for lindy stands out as one of the more tolerable tracks along with going out of my head , everybody needs a 303 and michael jackson . the guitar riff in santa cruz never seems to stop and gives me a headache while the lyrics in give a po ' man a break could do exactly that . the rest of the tracks are evidently an exercise in how to use a sequencer and are apparently written to cram as many repeated samples into each song as possible . i really wanted to like this album , but it offers little of redeeming quality ; quite simply it 's dull . ultimately , there is just not enough here to warrant its purchase
