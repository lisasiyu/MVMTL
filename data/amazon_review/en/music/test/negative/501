dont waste your money wack cd . low quality producer/s and talent . except for about 2 or 3 artists ( rakim & ken-y being the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 stars ) this whole compilation is a complete waste of your time and money . if you value your hard earned money then may i suggest `` los kambumbos '' . it is a compilation of high quality produced by dj jova and it includes a pantheon of quality artists including ; trebol clan , khriz & angel , nicky jam , tito el bambino and more .
