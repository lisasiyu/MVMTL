what a disappointment overall , this is nothing more than a bunch of entrance themes for the wwf ; if you do n't believe me , just ask edge . in my opinion , there is not one good song on this entire cd , and i have been a huge fan of rob and white zombie in the past . rob , please go back to making good music and refrain from making garbage like this
