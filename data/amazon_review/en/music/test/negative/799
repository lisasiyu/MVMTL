good , but why buy this when there is smiling phases ! ? ! ? ! ? for a penny less , you can get every song on `` feelin 's alright '' and eleven more songs from the compilation smiling phases . sure , this one disc compilation contains *great music* but what shmoe would buy it when you can get more music on 2-cds for less money ? ? ? ? perhaps another reviewer can fill me in on the `` logic '' of buying this over smiling phases because i do n't see it
