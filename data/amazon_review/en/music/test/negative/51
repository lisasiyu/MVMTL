i give thirds 2 i bought this cd for one song , & quot ; walk away & quot ; which was one of their best known songs . i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems . there was n't . the rest of the album is like an anti-climax . i would suggest a greatest hits instead . if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away
