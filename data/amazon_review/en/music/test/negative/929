a disappointment : ( having listened to one of the hottest balance releases ( desyn masiello balance 08 ) , i had high expectations from the follow up release ( paolo mojo balance 09 ) . unfortunately , they are completely opposites when it comes to my listening enjoyment . the tracks in paolo 's compilation are nothing but outdated . i ca n't wait for jimmy van m 's release of balance 10 to erase the bad memories of paolo 's buzz kill .
