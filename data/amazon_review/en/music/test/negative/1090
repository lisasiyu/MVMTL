do n't be distracted i 've listened to this cd several times , and after reading the other reviews here , i just do n't hear what is so great about this music . this guy does not impress me whatsoever as a trumpet player . he does not really play the trumpet , he just toots some notes over some beats that some would consider `` funk '' . the only stand-out tracks here are `` on the one '' and `` family '' , and they are just mediocre at best . everything else here is just a couple of 2-minute `` snippets '' and some parliament-funkadelic-inspired pseudo-funk jams . this stuff sounds like this guy got bored one saturday afternoon and decided to go into his garage and make some noise with his kids . for some real trumpet and real contemporary jazz-funk , i recommend patches stewart and joey sommerville . check out their cd 's , you wo n't be disappointed
