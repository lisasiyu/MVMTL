kasabian has run out of ideas i like several songs on kasabian 's old album but there were also many poor ones . still on this album i dont know if i could say that there are any songs better than club foot , reason is treason , and processed beats . it seems kasabian has gone psychedelic and also run out of ideas in the process , there is nothing special or creative on this album
