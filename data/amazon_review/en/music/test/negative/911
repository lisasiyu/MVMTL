nostalgic kitsch on a theme of guaraldi ... or , how to make a quick buck on someone elses stuff . or , to summarize with a trite phrase , & quot ; ca n't beat the real thing & quot ; . the legendary guaraldi wrote jazz that is akin to american culture , and is loved by all . this translation takes something that was perfect and takes it down the other side of the peak . is n't it enough to enjoy the original works without embellishing it with some popular anecdotes ? would you buy steely dan from anyone but fagen ? it just misses the mark , and screws up a good thing
