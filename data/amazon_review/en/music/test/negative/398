good songs ... .but good album ? debateable she has some rockin songs on here . all her singles kickass and the last song on the album with m.i.a . ( i friggin love her ) is fire . but then , i start listening to the other songs , ready for a song on the album that is just as good as her singles and i ca n't find another . all of missy 's singles are crazy , but then ui listen to the album , and its like a let down . any song that she sings in makes my stomach churn and some have just annoying beats and repititious phrases . if you really liked missy 's album 'this is not a test ' , then get this album . but if you are lovin her singles and want some more , just download the singles , do n't waste your money on the rest of this album .
