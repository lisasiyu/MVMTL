good house music does not equal good music 2 1/2 competent though disappointing , this highly referenced trance album can not escape it 's plodding , dated backbone of a beat , no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be . of course , listening to the album 13 years later , one immediately feels the bland , aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality , which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in house-centric circles that is . the thudding , ever present , 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper , rendering most of the yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal . thankfully once in a while , particularly at the start and finish of the disc , a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions , allowing dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways
