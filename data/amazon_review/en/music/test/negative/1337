virtuoso guitar playing , complex musical structures ! here we go again ... .another tortured collection of three chord , twelve barre delta blues . in truth , these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited robert johnson first recorded them ; now hearing clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying . how many times can we hear `` i woke up this morning , baby ; my cow just up and died ... ..da dum , da dum , da dum ... ..i woke up this morning , baby . my cow just up and died . da dum , da dum , da dum ... . so i drank a bottle of hooch and i began to cry ... .da dum , da dum , da dum ... . '' come on , people ! if this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization . when eric clapton plays cole porter , duke ellington , and rogers and hart on his guitar -- -unaccompanied -- -- chords , melody and bass line -- -- like django reinhardt , wes montgomery , and joe pass -- -- then maybe i 'll consider him a great guitarist . today 's youth are clueless about almost everything , and guitar virtuosity is no exception . i do n't believe clapton has ever heard of key modulation , arpeggios , or chord substitutions . in truth , he is an average rock guitarist , and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing , that 's not saying much . for anyone to call him a great guitarist , let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived , is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity . it 's like saying madonna is the greatest singer of all time . odds are those who make such vacuous , ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie woodstock generation who would n't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him ( which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time ) . i know we 're living in the age of grand mediocrity , but enough is enough . go buy a wes montgomery , django reinhardt or barney kessel album and listen to sophisticated , nuanced , and soulful guitar viruosity . if you have half a brain , you 'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated , unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like clapton and hendrix were great guitarists . if after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that clapton is a great guitarist , here 's what you do : pick up your fender strat , turn the amp volume up to 10 , smoke a joint , and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist . eric clapton is a great guitarist ! what a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s .
