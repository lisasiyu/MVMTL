all due respect ... but the flame 's died down . i got into afi with the release of art of drowning , which is a fantastic album . my girlfriend at the time had black sails in the sunset and even though i did n't really get into it then , i now think it rivals aod . afi has always been a band to look towards the future and embrace a sense of progress ( this is highly commendable ) . these two albums , which formed my introduction to afi , now stand as the mid-part of their career . the band has always refused to simply fall into the groove of what 's cool . they 've always been unique . their first two albums came out of their intense interest in the 80 's and early 90 's hardcore punk scene . davey havoc may have summarized the roots of the albums best when he says , `` ever since i can remember i wanted to be in a hardcore band , '' at the beginning of the `` he who laughs last '' video . these albums are full of the intensity of the early hardcore scene . when the band emerged into this middle era the music was totally fresh and delightfully dark ( it was there in the early days , though , in songs like brownie bottom sundae ) . these middle albums ( haloween ep and self-titled included ) also had an intensity and an energy that blew away their old sound . moreover , i 've yet to hear a band in the world of punk ( past and present ) who 's music rivals this intensity . i appreciate the two newer albums on an artistic level ; they continue to break the mold ( the goth glam influence is pretty cool ) . besides , who can say they did n't see them foreshadowed in certain moments on black sails and aod . but , personally , it 's pretty difficult to listen to decemberunderground . afi deserves all the respect in the world but i do n't feel much of the fire of the old days .
