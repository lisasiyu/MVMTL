listen to cohen himself ! it was irritating to hear the singers butcher cohen 's poetic songs . like other reviewers i wonder why bono had to be there ? it was nice that the singers paid a tribute to the man but it 's unfortunate that they took it one step further by singing his songs . some of the renditions are simply bad ... like bird on a wire ! please ...
