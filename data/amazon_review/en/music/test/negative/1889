only imitation of great art i used to own this cd and i thought it was absolutely groundbreaking and a wonderfully creative release from mike patton and co . however , i just bought torture garden by naked city . the fact is , naked city was doing this exact same stuff over 10 years ago ! i could not believe that art like this came out back then ! do n't get this cd , it is patton ripping off john zorn 's brilliance . get torture garden instead . it is much more daring for its age and actually just sounds much better , fuller . mike patton is mosly ridding the inspirations of other artists
