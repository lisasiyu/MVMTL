buyer beware there 's nothing wrong with the performance : it 's gershwin himself , according to the editorial review , taken from a piano roll . `` music experience in 3-dimensional sound reality '' it says on the packaging . all i can say is , it 's a thin excuse for a surround-sound dvd-audio disc : the one track is the only thing on it . maybe 15 minutes , total , though nowhere on the disc or its packaging does it mention the track list or the timing . or that it 's remastered from a piano roll , for that matter . and all at a premium price ? you 've got to be kidding ! watch out for the entire dvd-audio series by alexander goldberg jero . i bought several , to fill out my dvd-audio collection , and none have lived up to expectations
