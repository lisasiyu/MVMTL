zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ... ... . i remember reading about this album in rolling stone . it had 2 stickers on it . it had the usual `` parental advisory '' sticker ( is there a rap album that does n't ) and another one saying `` the lyrical content on this album strictly represents the views of the artist '' ( or words to that effect ) . the article 's main point was asking `` are albums going to get two labels now ? what 's next ? '' . so , my `` i hate censorship '' side got all flustered , and i went out and bought it . it 's a piece of s -- t. the beats are boring , and all the lyrics seem to consist of is `` my name mc eiht . no one better mess with me '' . he pads this wonderfully original thought out to 70 minutes or so , and it gets incredibly tedious . needless to say , the sticker `` controversy '' never erupted into anything beyond this album . i just ended buying a really boring album , and i immediately got rid of it .
