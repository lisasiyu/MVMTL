what 's so freakin ' great about this ? i hate ac/dc , them and metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department . as musicians , these guys are very average at best , most of the time , they 're below average . it does n't matter if it 's bon scott or brian johnson singing for them , ac/dc has always sucked . unlike other metal bands like slayer and sepultura , ac/dc 's songs are very cheesy and boring , the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia . want real 80 's metal ( not glam ) ? go for slayer , sepultura , kreator , exodus , iron maiden , judas priest , mercyful fate , hellhammer and many others
