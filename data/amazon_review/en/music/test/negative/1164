there 's a reason why this was one of the greatest sellers of all time . for those of you who do n't know , this ranks in the top 100 as one of the greatest selling albums of all time . right up there with abbey road and dark side of the moon ! there 's a reason for this . first let 's all learn a new word today : commercialism webster 's dictionary states that commercialism is the practice of exchanging or selling products between different individuals where each individual is trying to gain something they did n't have before at the expense of losing something they already had . this does work one ways sometimes . for example : in britany spears ' case record consumers lose their money to spears and spears does n't give anything back in exchange . or maybe she does ? she gives us images of her body which make inperfect looking girls feel like garbage . she gives us paper from the linear notes which we could use to jot down notes on or use as napkins . she gives us talentless images and sounds which make us thankful we have talents and vaules which she clearly lacks . so why is this such a great selling album . because people are willing to buy the album and , as a result , get those great things i mentioned in the previous paragraph . and there is a reason why those things are great . where would we be today without spears ' casual sex preferences encouraging young girls to have all the sex they want and thus come down with aids and god knows what else . where would we be without spears ' mtv videos encouraging us to sit around at home watching them while gaining weight from lack of exercise and eating doritos . all the while she stays fit because of her personal trainers and chefs that she got with our money . and where would we be with out an idol to kiss the feet of and sacrafice animals to . see , with out those great things we would be stuck in a world where people feel good about themselves , are highly motivated , and realise that you do n't have to look perfect to be a good person . thank god we live in this world where everbody is unequal and there is a sharp divide between the rich and beautiful and those who are n't . i do n't think are favorite , lovable idol , britney spears ' , would be able to survive in the formerly mentioned world . ... ... if you believed anything in that second paragraph then this album is for you ! as i said before i 'm not forcing you to not buy this album , i am just giving reasons why i think its a poor product and is not recommended unless you really like commercialized bubblegum .
