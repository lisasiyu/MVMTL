an embarrasment i remember when this came out and as a guitar player myself , i was highly intrigued with the names involved on this project . my initial impression of april lawton was to hang up my guitar and forget the whole thing ( she is/was a damn good guitar player ) . afterwords i realized that this album is quite an embarrasment . their next release , the more acoustic in april came the dawning of the red suns is a much better effort .
