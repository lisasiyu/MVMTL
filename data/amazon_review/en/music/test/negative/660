you see me cryin ' ... tho ' aerosmith 's first greatest hits package was n't perfect ( lacking train kept a rollin ' and featuring edited am single versions of a couple big hits ) , it still stands hair and shoulders above this `` second coming of aerosmith '' mix . where dream on was a definitive power ballad of its era , big ones is overstuffed with the lame metal mellow-dies ( cryin ' , amazing , crazy ) that have become the bad boys ' schlock in trade . i reckon chart peak/career low i do n't wan na miss a thing will have to wait for hits 3 . even the so called rockers ( the dumb and dumber dude looks like a lady and love in an elevator ) ca n't hold a bic lighter to fine , funky seventies fare walk this way and same old song and dance , and i refuse to dignify anything from get a grip with an insult . it only gets worse , and sadder , after that album , folks . what 's the point of being the longest lived rock band after mick and keith if you 're not even gon na rock anymore ? ? ? ( sigh ) ... call me `` jaded '' . rating : two lips
