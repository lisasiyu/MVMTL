5 stars ? you 're kidding ! ! this is easily the worst sinatra/riddle/capitol record and i 'm not surprised it 's been unavailable for years.sinatra wanted to record something with the hollywood string quartet and this is the result . he 's in wonderful voice , but the material stinks and riddle 's scores are painfully dragging . he simply does n't have enough musicians on these dates and the strings are headache inducing . `` blame it on my youth '' is the standout , but you can keep the rest . the emperor has no clothes on this one
