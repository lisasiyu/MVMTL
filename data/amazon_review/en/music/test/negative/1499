their worst effort yet i am a long-time fan of the boys from brum and can honestly say that this release is horrid . they recorded the disc as a disjointed unit where everything befroe was as a team . the slick effort and reliance on electronic music shows big time . i have played their other discs non-stop throughout the years but `` homegrown '' is one that was played three times and each time i never got past track # 4 . save your cash on this one . a truely bad effort . they did , however , hit gold when they recorded their recent `` who you fighting for . '' now that one is worth the $ $ $
