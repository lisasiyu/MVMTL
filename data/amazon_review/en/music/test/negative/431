impulsive ? i bought this record i do n't know why . i heard a few tracks and thought it sounded ok. i listened to it once and it sounded so blase . i do n't really know what i expected . i have add so sometimes lyrics do n't really matter -- the rocking of the music does , which may be why i like jazz so much , because it does n't have words . neither here nor there . any way : and yes i know this is n't really much of a review : i think this is a record the casual observer may pick up for whatever reason and thrust aside . i think this is one that one must make a conscious effort to listen to and appreciate for what it is . first listenl -- not impressed . but give it a chance .
