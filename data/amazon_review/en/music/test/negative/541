2-1/2 stars -- my 700th review ! whee ! ! ! after the success of kamikaze , many diehard twista fans accused him of having sold out , because it was n't until he hit the mainstream that he started seeing platinum sales . love it or hate it , twista tried to continue that essence with his follow-up , the day after . unfortunately , it just does n't work as well . most of the other two-star reviews are pretty accurate ( especially constant and norris ' respective reviews ) . i think it can be assumed that the day after is women 's day because twista is spending most of the album rapping to the ladies ( ll cool j , anyone ? ) . not only that , but in some places it 's a little too obvious that he 's trying to recapture the magic of `` slow jamz '' . the lead single `` girl tonite '' is the most obvious example of this , especially since twist is once again naming balladeers and their respective songs . also , am i the only one to find it a little odd that twista says `` when i touch her , she like '' and then trey says `` oh '' ? ( think about it a minute . ) another example is an obligatory neptunes track called `` lavish '' , where twista proves that he ca n't always rap over a slow beat . yet another song for the ladies that fails is `` so lonely '' featuring mariah carey . i do n't know what 's up with mimi 's voice on the song , but she kind of sounds like a wannabe version of herself . speaking of weird hooks , `` had to call '' features a chorus sung by somebody named sleepy eyed jones , and he sounds like , well , it 's kind of like the equivalent to how dj premier would sound if he tried to sing . there are also some songs that badly use samples , especially the aptly titled `` do wrong '' ( with lil ' kim ) , which borrows a sample from al green 's `` love & happiness '' . and `` i 'm a winner '' terribly samples r. kelly 's `` one me '' , and if that 's not bad enough , twista is even repeating some of the lines he used in `` girl tonite '' . but things are n't much better when he 's not kickin ' it to the females : the title track does n't go anywhere , and syleena johnson 's hook adds nothing to the song . `` heartbeat '' is a little too violent ( especially because the song opens with a long round of shots ) , and `` check that h* '' has a wack chorus . and `` holding down the game '' is a bling-blingin ' song that is unnecessarily screwed and chopped in the middle of it -- and anyway , if you wanted to hear someone rapping slowly , you would n't pick up a twista album , would you ? the only song really worth hearing on the whole album is `` get it how you live '' . it 's nice that twista is still trying to do his thing , but i heard this album one day last week and then i had no desire to listen to it again the day after . anthony ruper
