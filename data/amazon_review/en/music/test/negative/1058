weak , noncommital , and boring in 1994 , morgan heritage released miracle , its lackluster debut lp , and followed it three years later with the superb protect us jah . since then , the band has established a reputation for melodious , but uninspired , crossover albums that seem only to appeal to listeners with a casual interest in reggae music . for a band that began its career with glaringly mediocre music , coming `` full circle '' is nothing to celebrate . in this latest offering , the band reasserts their formula of `` safe '' pop-reggae designed to be commercially viable in the north american and british markets . like previous albums , full circle meanders from r & b ( `` enough is enough '' ; `` your best friend '' ) to watered-down roots ( `` propoganda '' ; `` so much to come '' ) , with a handful of dancehall tracks bolstered by guest appearances . between the electric guitar riffs and the appearance of bounty killer on the final cut , it 's obvious that the producers are trying desperately to reach the broadest possible audience . as rastafari reggae artists , morgan heritage 's generic message and nonprovocative image stands in stark contrast to the raw energy and fervor of such contemporaries as lutan fyah and capleton . sadly , both full circle and heritage 's recent live performances stand as further evidence that the band is n't interested in producing anything other than slick , commercial , feel-good jah music . this is unfortunate , because the morgans are talented vocalists . most tragic of all , however , is that the only time heritage is provocative is when they 're preaching intolerance toward christians and homosexuals in their lyrics and concert interludes . despite its stylistic and lyrical inconsistency , the album is not without its strong points ; highlights include the catchy , uptempo `` hail up the lion '' and the dancehall remix of `` u 've got me '' . even so , there is n't nearly enough substance here to keep you interested long , even if you happen to love the album initially . expect copies of full circle to accumulate in used record stores over the next six months
