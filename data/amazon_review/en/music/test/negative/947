where is the ice cube i know ? what happened ? ice cube is my favorite rapper of all time ! for anyone else this would have been 3 stars , but this is a real disappointment to me persoanlly . if you like the older hard hitting ice cube and nwa i would try one of his earlier releases . who knows though ... i love plenty of cds that i hated at first
