old stuff look this album is old as i dont know what , this album wasnt even finished , they started on it like in early 2001 , as far as tha production it will always be tight from paul and juicy-j , this was like an underground album , not like a world wide realease , thats why some will say its not that tight as production wise , it wasnt even through , thats why they put some of there old stuff on there with pastor troy and boo thats stuff is old , have u noticed that paul and others where just on hooks , some where supposed to be on there but paul took there verses off , because t-rock left over money and mic time , the album wasnt done , so there for they threw old songs on there cause he left , which was stupid because he would of gotten paid , so he left and now he aint getting nothing from this album , all that money is going to paul and juicy , t-rock is dumb , look tha unbreakables is gon na set tha world on fire its gon na be there hottest album to date watch , with boo gone u know they gon na have alot of superstars on there i would tell u but i got to go , if u dont believe me wait and see holl
