what am i missing ? i think it is very admirable that marsalis has attempted to produce a classical cd , however , this is not the sublime , masterpiece that so many previous reviewers have labelled it . his tone is particularly unstable , and not very even , his soprano playing is miles better than his alto however . this is a real shame , as the primary solo instrument in the saxophone family is the alto , anyone beginning study in classical saxophone would need to get this sorted first . his tuning is barely acceptable , but only for a jazzo , he would be shot if he played so out for a real saxophone teacher . please have a listen to some real repertoire for saxophone , played by a real player , such as bornkamp , rousseau , delangle , fourmeau , michat , londeix , etc . this is a good introduction to classical music , if for the first time , but please do n't accept this as being the be all and end all of classical music , and of saxophone
