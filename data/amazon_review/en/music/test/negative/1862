not good ... .not good at all ... sorry . i 'm as big of a bowie fan as anyone , but i have to be objective and honest : bowie 's output from 'let 's dance ' through this album , 'earthling ' , just flat out sucked . sure , there were good tracks here and there , but bowie 's heart just seemed to not be in his music . in the '70 's , he changed from style-to-style and developed his reputation as a musical chameleon ... but commitment was in each of those recordings . beginning with 'let 's dance ' , it almost seemed as if he felt a need to constantly change to live up to his reputation and keep current and modern , but his head was somewhere else . take this album . it 's supposed to be club music and electronically-disco based , but that style combined with bowie 's anthony newley-styled vocals just clash and the overall effect is more irritating than enchanting . the opening track , `` little wonder '' , is such an alarming turn-off that it 's hard not to turn the damn thing off without listening to the rest of the cd . thankfully , beginning with his next album , 1999 's 'hours ' , bowie seemed content to accept his past , his legend and his legacy without having to jump aboard every musical trend that pops up . the result has been three excellent albums in a row ( 'hours ' , 'heathen ' , and 'reality ' )
