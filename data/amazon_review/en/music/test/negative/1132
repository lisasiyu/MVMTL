the only good thing about this single ... i feel skeptical about nin singles ever since they have stopped releasing them domestically in the usa . the singles just have n't been as good . the only good thing about this single is the live at rehearsals version of love is not enough . it has a raw and rough feeling that i appreciate from the now too over-produced nin . the dfa remix of thtf is too long - drawn out and redundant ... like a bad techno song . buy this if you collect halos ( like i do ) ... but if you 're looking for a great single with great remixes ... look for the promo 12inches instead .
