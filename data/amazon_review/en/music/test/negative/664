not the best album for your next cocktail party unless you 're born again i own and really liked ms. chenoweth 's previous album , i 've enjoyed her on the stage , and i also like gospel music in general . i do n't think i 'm anti-religion . still , this album was a bit of a shock . it 's a huge departure from her work to date and i hope just an aberration . wikipedia calls as i am `` a mixture of hymns and contemporary christian music ... with arrangements that sound similar to adult contemporary . '' it also notes that `` to promote the album , she made an appearance on the 700 club . '' this was probably good marketing , because the only place i have heard music comparable to this is on religious cable channels . if you like lyrics about jesus set to saccharine arrangements ( `` because he lives , i can face tomorrow '' ) , you will enjoy this album . what was she thinking ? incidentally , if you are looking for really strong reinterpretations of great gospel songs , cds by the late eva cassidy contain some better choices . taylor the latte boy is cute , but it 's hardly worth ordering the whole album to get it . it 's covered by many other artists , e.g . susan egan . skip this , unless you are looking for music for a church gathering .
