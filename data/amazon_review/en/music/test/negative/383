a wink is as good as a nod to rod i 'm in the process of confirming the rumour that rod was being seriously considered for a knighthood until the royal family was accidently subjected to listening to this cd.the rest , as they say , is history . let 's get serious , every performer of rod 's stature has the right to dress up and sing like a lounge lizard once and awhile . but like every good joke you only have to tell it to the audience once , not three times and counting.the only group that applauded the release of this cd were chronic insomniacs . rod needs to emerge from the `` counting room '' of his graceland mansion in st.tropeze and get serious about the music instead of the bottom line . forecasts are not promising . the music industry is abuzz , that his next project under consideration is a tribute album to the legendary harry reser and the clicquot club eskimos orchestra . it 's being leaked on the web , that through the state of the studio art , harry 's instrumental tracks are being combined with newly created lyrics for many of his best selling tunes . the standouts include , '' the old town pump '' and '' send me back my honeyman '' .i have serious reservations concerning the project 's success , particularly given the weak performances represented on the american songbook vol.3 . however , hope springs eternal .
