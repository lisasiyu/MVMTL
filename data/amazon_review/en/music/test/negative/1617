mediocre for benoit i have been a db fan for a while but simply found nothing new in his latest effort . the beginning is basically the same as `` fuzzy logic '' and `` right here , right now '' , and the whole cd 's format is just too predictable and less jazzy than before . he 's probably trying to be a bit brizilian but just not quite there ... not impressive at all !
