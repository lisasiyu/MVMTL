they could have made a better compilation i do n't want to pinpoint any one of the releases in the anthology series because they 're all guilty of just being thrown together with alternate takes , television outtakes , inferior rough recordings and false starts . the unrleleased material ( that which has been bootlegged for years ) , however , is what brings us out of the overbearing potpourri . i have always been a fan of the unreleased early material including the decca record audition tracks . in fact , the first side of a1 could have done without the spoken word breaks and got down to some rock and roll , but if they only started from track 10 ( `` my bonnie '' ) and stopped at `` lend me your comb '' only to tack on `` leave my kitten alone '' and leave it at that . but that 's just one example of how this should have been executed for release . the other two anthologies are worthy of scrutiny as well . this is yet another disappointment for me such as was with rubber soul when i first bought it on cd . the fact that the beatles were going to give a good portion of their unreleased material the light of day got me excited until the day the anthologies were released . i give two stars particularly for the two new john lennon songs that were beatle-ized for this 6-disc compilation though
