ashes to ashes `` phoenix '' : this is the first record grand funk made after one their core members was ousted -- terry knight . it 's a good record , at best . however , compared to the albums released before `` phoenix , '' it 's a real yawner . the twinkie clavinet on some of the songs is hideously reminiscent of the partridge family 's sound ! it 's the anti-gfr , i tell ya ! another negative is that the `` phoenix '' era of gfr is sort of a precursor to `` christian rock '' -- lame ! it 's an all-too typical story in rock-n-roll land ; the rich rock musician does things on tour that 'd make the marquis de sade blush , feels guilty about it , and then hands out advice on how everybody else needs to find jesus . gag ! the liner notes of this record states , `` although not a million-seller , `` phoenix '' was nonetheless another top ten album for the band , and proved they could do it on their own . '' well , i 'm not sure just what they mean by that `` it , '' but for me `` it '' has to do with losing their great sound by kicking out one of grand funk railroad 's founding members , and replacing him with a large sack of sweet'n low . about the `` grand funk remasters '' : first of all , what took so freakin ' long to release these records in this format ? why do we have to listen to crappy sounding cds in this day and age ? as nathan ( william snape ) says in `` the full monty '' during one his dad 's ( robert carlyle ) clumsy dance rehearsals -- '' that were crap ! '' even the beatles catalog is taking forever to get released on quality cds ! ( `` the capital albums vol . 1 '' ) oh well , better late than never , i guess ! i just have one last thing to say to the record companies , et al involved concerning this faux pas ; guess which finger i 'm holding up ! there 's a world of difference between the sound of these cds and the sterile sounding earlier digital releases of the same material ; that fact alone justifies buying the remasters . however , the bonus music on these cds makes them a must-buy for anyone who likes grand funk .
