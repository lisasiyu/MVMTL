seventy-one long minutes `` raw ? '' `` energetic '' ? `` in your face '' ? i honstly ca n't understand how anybody could think the stuff on ism is any of those things . energy level is close to that of `` the trinity sessions '' , but this band does n't have the self-discipline - or the vocal & instrumental skills , for that matter - of the cowboy junkies , so they go on & on & on & on & on ... meandering dweebishly forever . capsule description - high-pitched personality-free vocals that are not imho improved by the very free application of reverberberberb , against a background of lethargic mush . coming soon to garage sales all over the country
