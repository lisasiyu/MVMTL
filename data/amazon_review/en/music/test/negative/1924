a compilation ... . make a mix of michael 's first two solo albums ( michael schenker group and msg ) , add ufo 's & quot ; doctor doctor & quot ; and that 's the set list for this live album recorded in japan . so , the utility of this album is in accord with your preference for live albums or not , because , if you already own hhis first two albums , this album is utterly superfluous . at least the line up is the same of msg : barden , michael , glen , raymond and powell , and they deliver with their customary high skills and professionalism
