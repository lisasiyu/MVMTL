not that great the only song i like on the album is `` for these times '' ... the rest of the songs are crummy . her song `` anyway '' just gets on my nerves . the album sounds like pop/rock/opera/one big mess ! ! ! ! martina ca n't sing a damn note and this album sounds terrible ! what the hell went wrong here ? do n't waste your money ! buy kellie pickler and carrie underwood and dolly parton
