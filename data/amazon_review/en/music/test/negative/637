not as good as his 3 previous salsa albums *** stars - ca n't change the above ! valio is a rearrangement of some of the songs of amar sin mentiras . and it definitely has the feeling of an afterthought . while it is a pretty decent salsa album ( albeit brief ) , it is simply not in the class of his other three salsa cd 's , todo a su tiempo , contra la corriente , and especially , libre . the arrangements are standard competent rather than thorougly innovative and unique as were the older ones .
