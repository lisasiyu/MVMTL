thirty seconds is still too much let 's face it folks this is not a rock album that everyone believes it is . i will start by saying i did n't play the 30 second snippet for `` all i want to do '' because i knew it was already a lost cause , the rest were all just as bad . there are only 2 songs that may be a little bit o.k . and they are `` ca n't cry anymore '' , and `` we do what we can '' . i just feel that this was a pop album all the way even though it has a rock edge do n't be decieved . i do n't know what she 's like , or anything like that , but i do know she 's beautiful , but while talented it 's not the music i seek to listen to .
