too little , too late although bad religion formed in 1980 , they seem to fit in with the punk revival scene of the 1990 's rather than the original hardcore punk scene . their first album , `` how could hell be any worse '' which was released in 1982 , was dwarfed by the competition in southern california by such bands as black flag , the circle jerks , social distortion , and the descendents . in 1983 , they released `` into the unknown , '' which was an attempt at cheesy progressive rock that was heavy on the synthesizers . that album pretty much ended their relationship with the hardcore community and was such an embarrassment that they wo n't re-release it . bad religion was ignored until 1988 when they released `` suffer '' to a new generation of hardcore fans . at that point in time , hardcore punk was pretty much dead and bad religion was one of the only bands around at the time playing that style of music , so they were successful without any competition . `` against the grain '' is considered to be the peak of bad religion 's career . once again , they were still one of the only bands around playing punk so there was n't much to compare it to and that was a good thing for them because it 's a weak record . the style of punk they play is very pop . the only thing that gives it a punk edge is the speed , but it 's not raw and angry like earlier hardcore . some say the lyrics are very angry , but it 's tough to find the anger through the `` whoa-whoa-whoas '' and `` aye-aye-ayes ' . '' there 's nothing wrong with using a harmonized and melodic pop rock vocal style , if you do n't intend to be taken seriously . the misfits and the descendents could pull off the pop vocal style because they generally sung about humorous and outlandish things . bad religion sings about serious issues , but delivers it in an upbeat way which really kills any impact their message may have . the music that backs the computer geek sound of the vocals is all about speed and almost seems bouncy at times . `` 21st century digital boy '' is the best song by far , but it 's ruined by the vocals . all the rest of the songs basically sound the same . there are plenty of '80 's hardcore records out there that are far superior to anything bad religion has ever recorded . the '90 's revival of punk had nothing new to offer the genre , so go straight to the source and listen to black flag , the misfits , and the dead kennedys , who were original and sincere .
