scraping the bottom of the barrel as if toxicity wasnt mediocre enough , this just takes everything that was once good and dumps all over it . where do we place the blame ? is it darons poor songwriting skills ? or maybe its the dropping of the once thrash-driven riffs and drums in favor of a more accessible mtv-whitewashed corporate music that everyone and their parents would eat up ? or maybe theirs just no more soul left in a once killer band that was a breath of fresh era from all that nu-metal garbage that invaded the radio and tv ? whichever one you choose , this is not the soad we all love , this is an unoriginal rehash of toxicity . oh wow , they have an anti-government song ? so what , who hasnt made one of those . and anti-war songs ? travel back to the 60s , they were chock full full of them . everything i hear is uninspired and downright lazy . its also unfortunate that serj got sidelined by daron `` i wish i had talent '' malakian , for he literally tries too hard to make interesting songs , while coming out in the end as those annoying kids that have adhd in your classroom that are just seriously not funny . maybe im being to harsh , but you would be annoyed too if a once great band betrayed their pre-toxicity fanbase in order to get more money and exposure , and in turn seem hypocritical to their lyrics . you want to get good music , get soad 's self titled , its their best and the only one that wasnt corrupted by the capitalist pigs known as mtv .
