you can go far if you have no talent . the sweet escape by gwen stefani is unoriginal , shallow , and the most pathetic album of 2006 . first of all , she ca n't sing , she ca n't write and she needs to go back to where she came from , no doubt . when she was with that band , the songs were halfway decent and the guys in the band rocked , not her . the only reason she got famous because she liked to show her nasty looking stomach off and she was dating a popular musician at the time who would later become her husband . well honey , you are a nobody and hopefully people will come to their senses and realize the same thing as well . do n't waste your money on this garbage , if you want a real singer then check-out some real garbage , shirley manson instead
