a few good bands but way to much emo/screamo this is an okay compilation however its far from the best . if your looking for good punk music you wont find much of it here . heres a list of the bands i thought were pretty good the offspring pennywise strung out strike anywhere mxpx millencoln no use for a name street dogs plain white t's i really hate emo music , and it 's not like a really really hate all screamo/hardcore music its just that i really do n't wan na hear like 40 songs in arow of it it almost sounds the same . hopfully next year there will be some more punkish bands on the tour such as propagandhi , nofx , desendendents , pennywise , rise against , black flag , anti-flag ... et
