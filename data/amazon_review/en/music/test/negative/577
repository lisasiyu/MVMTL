no new tricks i am a huge a jurassic 5 fan , in fact they are probably the single biggest influence of why i started to like hip hop . on this album nothing catches your attention . the use the same formula that they have used in the past , but the execution of the songs sometimes seems forced . a lot of that has to do with cut chemist not being there . nu-mark is a good producer , but when he steps aside to let others produce the music you can tell the difference . `` back 4 you '' and `` red hot '' are really the only two good songs on the album . there are a couple of other decent tracks but nothing that is going to get stuck in your head . also the song with dave matthews band is awful , but j5 wanted to try something new , and i think that is an interesting artistic decision , it just does not work very well between these two styles . this is by far the worst j5 album , if you want classic j5 pick up quality control , or their ep , each of these are defining hip hop
