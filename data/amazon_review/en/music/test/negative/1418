fairly average i will always give shelia e.madd props for her musical talent but this album does n't do it for me all the way.soft vibe & missing some snap.there are hints of funk here & there but overall nothing really cooks to me.she does her best work overall for others & live to me.but this is another mild album which hardly to me showcases her full musicial depth
