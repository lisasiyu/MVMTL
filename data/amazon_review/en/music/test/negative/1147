she 's lost her way ( temporarily , i hope ) i had such high hopes for this album before it was showed up . her previous releases with union station were artistic wonders - brilliant musicianship and thoughtful lyrics that required repeated listening to fully understand the complex relationships and stories that were presented . i could n't wait to hear what they had been cooking up . unfortunately , they did n't do any cooking on this album and i sincerely hope this is an aberration . i want to assume that someone simply gave her some bad advice or pushed her ( i like to think kicking and screaming ) to release some pabulum and make a quick buck . until i hear differently , i 'll continue to hold out hope that she 's in the recording studio with union station working on another wonderful album . the song writing here does n't hold a candle to `` new favorite '' and `` lonely runs both ways '' and the performances themselves are pleasant enough ( upon repeated listening , about four of the songs on `` miles '' are keepers ) but they are not the excellent work that i have associated with her in the past . alison has the capability to sing the most beautiful , clear tone and only occasionally ( to good effect ) let a breathy tone in . `` hundred miles '' reverses this trend as she over-uses a breathy tone and in doing so lowers herself into the sea of mediocre , but pleasant singers that she previously soared above . her song choices ( please tell me that someone else chose this mess of tunes for this album ) are an embarrassment . boring tunes , with silly or depressing themes ( the body count on this album is very high - by the end , multiple children and adults have committed suicide , been killed , or otherwise died ) and on many of the songs , i found myself glancing down at the time elapsed on my car 's cd player as the music droned on and on ( well into 5 minutes on too many ) . the best song ? `` down to the river to pray '' - recorded years ago before the bad influences who produced this sorry lot got to her . the worst ? probably `` missing you '' which is such a shock to the ears when the drums and electric guitar start pounding at the beginning of the track that i had to check the player to make sure i had n't accidently hit a button somewhere and jumped to a top 40 radio station . what on earth prompted her to record ( and then release ) such a sell-out ? alison - the lure of popularity is not worth it . please stay true to your artistic roots and never again make this deal with the devil . p.s . what are people thinking to make a song like `` whiskey lullaby '' such a big hit ? i agree that the singing is wonderful and i love both of their voices and the tune itself . but it 's all wiped out by the stupid lyrics . why do n't these two people pick up the phone and call each other ? what version of what religion has angels singing whiskey lullabies ? who writes the words `` put the bottle to her head and pulled the trigger ? '' i am drawn in when she sings ( in previous albums ) `` let me touch you for a while '' or `` when you cross over there 's no turning back once that burning bridge is gone . '' that 's poetry . this is sad , silly junk .
