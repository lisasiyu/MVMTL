please enter a title for your review it 's ridiculous that any band would even bother recording and releasing such weak bland redundant excuses for songs , but what 's especially disconcerting , yet somehow not that surprising , is that it 's coming from a band that earlier this year released an ep of perfectly decent alt-rock emo tunes . it 's not really even that i 'm mourning a lack of talent in the faux-edgy music scene , but just the complete lack of awareness or regard for the difference between a song that has an actual hook , something distinctive in it that makes you want to hear it again , and just rehashing formulas , boring basic rigid commercial conventions without even 1 % of variation to make it marginally interesting . these guys wrote 5 decent semi-interesting tunes on the ep , now on the album they just do n't care anymore , they 're just rewriting other bands songs , following formulas like it 's their job , like they never knew the difference between hooks and plodding non-melodies , as if it was just blind luck that they wrote actual songs on the ep .
