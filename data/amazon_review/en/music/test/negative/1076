why listen to it for free when you can pay for it ? clearchannel strikes again ! first they bought up all the rights to the great classic rock bands music ; then they saw to it that any new music those bands recorded would never see the light of day ( bto , skynyrd , molly hatchet , and many others are still making great records , but clearchannel radio stations will not play them ) ; now , they 're spitting out their own digital k-tel compilations . to their credit , this is a pretty good batch of music . it 's missing a few great bands , simply because those are the bands that did n't sell their souls over to clearchannel to pay off the dealers and bookies . rush , zeppelin , floyd , the stones , springsteen , ac/dc , all not here because they held on to the rights to their music . smart move guys . they can still get their new material played . so , if you live in a rural area where the nearest classic rock radio station just does n't come in to good , pick this up . otherwise , you really do n't have to look to far to find this stuff , and clearchannel really does n't need anymore of your money to encourage them to continute bastardizing the music industry
