awful , awful , awful one great ballad , evermore without you , doth not a musical make . that song is stunning , slightly pedestrian lyrics not withstanding . the rest of the show is simply dreadful . some is downright irritating . '' a secret , a secret ... .. '' , that line plays on the nerves like a rat gnawing on the fingernails . horrible . i have a secret , stay away from this ridiculous mess . the plot is ludicrous , and the performances dull . they all sing it like they know how awful it is . and michael crawford has reached a new low in his mediocre career . hopefully someone like barbara cook or john barrowman will record evermore without you , so the world can appreciatte it without having to go near this embarrassing trash . sir andrew , c'mon , surely you can come up with something better than this
