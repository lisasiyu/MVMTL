a big dissapointment from a big olivia fan she has one of the most beautiful voices , and is one of my all-time favorite female singers . this album is terrible though . unlike agnetha faltskog , k.d . lang , and alison moyet , who ( in my humble opinion ) succeeded recently with their `` cover '' albums ( made-up of some of their favorite songs from the past ) , olivia does not succeed in the choice of songs , production , and style of singing these
