good job bebe and joel ... sorry , ann . a not bad recording of this , in my view , poor and rather over-rated show . amazing orchestration and the performances of bebe neuwirth and joel grey stop this recording from falling in the gutter of musical tattle . the cast is nothing to get excited about quite frankly , although bebe neuwirth is a real treat as velma . i wish the same could be said about her co-star . reinking , with her voice similar to the noise of clattering shovels , manages to ( allbeit in the `` broadway-darling '' style we have grown accustomed to ) take awfulness to great new heights . the only thing that is good about her performance , quite frankly , is when it stops ... reminiscent of that blissful moment when people stop playing bagpipes . having said this , her acting is great , giving the character of roxie depth and meaning - however ancient she portrays her . this is something gwen verdon tried and failed at . on balance though , reinking 's badness outweighs anything else , sadly . neuwirth with her `` older '' style of voice and singing makes her seem to own the role of velma kelly here , although she does over-do the older-portrayal sometimes . joel grey lights up this recording with a superb performance and with much ease . on the whole , this is n't the best recording if this show i 've heard , but its certainly not the worst . a good buy if you know the show well , but , apart from that , steer clear for now .
