unhelpful , unsingable my church has been using this cd , and many people have been raving about it , but i feel that the reviews are unjustified . to me the cd promotes an experiential feeling of worship , where it is the music and the experience of the cd that is creating a 'feeling ' of god 's presence - many of the previous reviews appear to be alluding to such a thing . because the songs are conference songs the songs stick to adoration-type songs only ( ie . songs expressing the greatness of god ) - and there are n't really any songs which give their *focus* to expressing what god has done for us , or songs of confession , or songs of supplication , or songs by which we can encourage one another . the theology is very one-sided and i think for this reason very unhelpful - compare , say , to having a service where all you prayed for was to praise god for how great he is - while it 's a very important thing , it 's not the only thing - you are missing out on something and that 's what i think this cd does . the other problem i have is that the arrangements are just too high - sure , the singers on there can sing them , but anyone with an average voice range ( especially males ) will have some trouble hitting some of the notes in this . `` indescribable '' hits a top f - not great for congregational singing . there are some much better cds out there with good christian songs - i 'd skip this one and try something else
