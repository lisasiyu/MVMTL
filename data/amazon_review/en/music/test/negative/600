thank you lonestar for making the most annoying song ever ! i am baffled at how country music stations and fans of the horrible music can stand hearing lonestar 's `` mr . mom '' over and over again everyday . the song is as stupid as it is annoying , and the lyircs are extremely juvenile . who had the horrible idea of writing a song about stay at home mothers ? lonestar , the manwomen of country . but what 's worse is that nashville and country radio declared it a hit and decided to play it 25 times per day . ( and i thought that tim mcgraw 's `` back when '' was as bad as it could get ) let 's take a look at a few of the hillariously idiotic lyrics from this song : `` football , soccer and ballet squeeze in scouts and pta and there 's that shopping list she left that 's seven pages long how much smoke can one stove make the kids wo n't eat my charcoal cake it 's more than any maid can take being mr . mom well pampers melt in a maytag dryer crayons go up one drawer higher rewind barney for the fifteenth time breakfast , six naps at nine there 's bubble gum in the baby 's hair sweet potatoes ( they pronounce it per-tat-ers ) in my lazy chair been crazy all day long and it 's only monday mr . mom '' i should seriously consider becoming a country artist . i can make my voice sound like a male country singer and i can write meaningless whitetrash songs , so all i have to do now is find someone to play steel guitar for me , and i 'm gon na make it big as a star in nashville and all over redneck usa . if you want to hear good country , stay with classics like johnny cash and conway twitty . please pass on girly garbage and mindless hick mumbling
