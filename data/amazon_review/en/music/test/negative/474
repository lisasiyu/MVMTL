no , no , no , no , no , no dammit ! ! ! ( slams linear book down in fustration ) ( rating 4 out of 10- -2 stars ) hey , i love the west coast , as well as california ( hope to live there one day ) . i believe that they can come with the most creative hip hop in the game , and try to support anything that they do . but you do not know how mad i am at this album ! when i heard the dogg pound was comming with a new album , i could n't wait to cop it , because comming from some veterans from the west coast ( my favorites i might add ) , i had high expectations from this . this was a very dissapointing album . i guess the flaws are right in my face . i really do n't want to accept the fact that the west coast fell off , and i keep beliving that they 're going to get back on their feet , but this keeps sending me a few steps backwards . basically the spotlight reviewer `` constant '' made the perfect statement about this album . this trio 's rhymes skills have been kinda bad lately like on the song `` sittin on 23 's '' . it 's like each member tries to rhyme , and they do okay at some points , but fail most of the time . songs like `` hard on a hoe '' & `` fake***hoes '' are just horrible . the album name `` cali iz active '' you 'd think that they would bring as many west coast artists on this album , but they did n't . lady of rage , rbx , nate dogg , and ice cube appear on this , but the fact that david banner , p. diddy , pall wall are on this damages the albums image . also as many reviewers have stated , they 're rhyme style has n't really changed since 1992 . now thats a huge problem . there are some good tracks on this here , and when i say `` good '' , i mean they barely pass as listenable . i believe the self titled track `` cali iz active '' was a good one as well as how they brought all the artists from the west in for the video shoot , as i hoped that it would be like that on the album . although many of the beats are not west coast like , they are still a little nodding like `` keep it gangsta '' although lady of rage outshines kurupt and daz . `` it 's all hood '' is one of those `` good '' songs on here ( as i meantioned what i meant by `` good '' ) . overall , this is not a good album . to me this is a huge dissapointment . i denied my self and kept believing that this is a good album , but as i heard it over and over again , it got worse and worse . if anyone remembers when the west was on top of the rap game , knows that this is not the way you bring it back . new listeners , who are unfamiliar of it 's domination might like this album . i ca n't accept this at all . lyrics : c production : c- guest appearances : c- musical vibes : d overall : c- favorite tracks : cali iz active , slow your roll , do n't sweat it , honorable mention tracks : keep it gangsta , throwin up da c
