innovative in theory , but does n't come together i must say before i write this review , i tried . i tried really hard to get into this album . i am a huge pink floyd fan , a fan of all classic rock for that matter . i got this cd for it 's historical significance . it is , after all , the first rock opera . anything you hear about this album being similar to the wall by pink floyd is false . true , it is a rock opera that tells the story of a troubled individual , but it does n't get as advanced or deep as pink floyd does . there are a few key problems that get in the way of this goal . the music . original as it may be , the who 's strange melodies and instrumentation do n't do anything for me . the melodies are for the most part , predictable . when they try to go out on a limb , it fails and sounds forced . the guitar parts and solos sound thin , and although a big part of it is probably because the master tapes were ceremoniously burned and the recording is n't prime quality , i 'm sure a lot of it has to do with a mediocre recording job . it has it 's moments , for example , the first few secconds of `` smash the mirror '' . but on the whole , it sounds almost like amateurs . the songs . not trying to rag on any diehard townshend fans , but the songs seem to be forced into the opera mold . while this may make it more of a true `` rock opera '' than `` the wall '' , for example , it does n't make for a very easy listen . the horrible thing is that it is possible to write songs in opera form and have them flow . exhibit a : queen 's `` a night at the opera '' . although queen 's superb tracking skills probably helped their case a lot . which leads me into my next point . lack of depth . while musicians who do n't layer their songs with extra tracks and studio musicians generally appeal to me , they should n't try to make arena rock operas . the who 's attempts to make this work is very similar to asking the white stripes to make a rock opera . it ca n't be done effectively within the limits of the band . i did give this album two stars . one for an original concept that gave us so much in the long run , and another star for those few moments it has . smash the mirror ( the introduction ) , pinball wizard and the acid queen are alright . there is a reason why those tracks are popular . i 'm afraid that a lot of people are n't really analyzing this album and are just giving it five star ratings because it is `` the who '' , the band with the man who smashed his guitar onstage . if you are looking for a rock opera , i suggest `` a night at the opera '' or `` the wall '' . if you are looking for another `` the who '' album , i would suggest some of their later works . `` the who sells out '' was alright , certiantly better than this .
