forever tacky ? contrary to the concert of praise surrounding lang 's virtuosity , these memories have little to do with music . is fingerbreaking pace , music ? the scherzo of chopin third sonata says it all : it 's all about how fast lang can play , not at all about what chopin 's music means . the score -written by the decidely stubborn chopin- does n't acknowledge lang 's change of tempo : there is no such thing as the slow part in the middle . once again this music shows how well out of his depth this virtuoso is and how much hype , marketing and fashion of the day are propping these automats . i 'll take the impetuous argerich over this anytime : at least she is genuine . her scherzo is organic , fluid . a recent cd by pianist svetlana ponomareva displays similar qualities and although in the obscurity as much as lang is in the sun , she follows chopin 's score in a meaningful and sensitive way . check the soundclip on her website [ ... ] , compare with others on amazon , listen !
