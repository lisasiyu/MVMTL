brandon flowers , the hypocrit in short , this cd is half good and half crap . the cd starts strong with catchy guitar , and the obvious sharp synth parts . the thing that gets me is this bands over popularity with a genre of music that has been around for over 25 years . frontman brandon flowers complains about other successful new wave/postgarage bands success ( the bravery , the fever , bloc party , moving units ) and that they are `` riding on our success '' . meanwhile the killers go on tour with depeche mode after they reach platinum status and for some reason flowers does n't take a hint . he has simply become the depeche mode of 2004-whenever this band breaks up ( cuz they should ) . unfortunately this band has a lot less talent than depeche mode , seeing as how flowers voice is overly futzed with in mastering and he uses a pitch corrector in concert . plus half their cd sucks and their new cd is n't sounding much better . the new single is awful . quite terrible . now i know this review will get a bunch of thumbs down , but i know that those will be from people who have listened to each single on the radio and know nothing about real music , music history , or probably even how to play an instrument , so it wo n't bother me . if you want real new wave alternative rock check out these bands : the bravery kaiser chiefs moving units bloc party the fever the unicorns wolf parade the dove
