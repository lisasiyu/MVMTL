warmed-over weather report what really struck me on first listening to this , was the superficial resemblance to old weather report recordings ( this was before i actually got to the wr cover of `` boogie woogie waltz '' ; i subsequently listened to the original on sweetnighter , which turned out to be far superior in every way ) . part of the problem with this recording seems to be the ... musical ideas expressed on here ; subtract wayne shorter , joe zawinul , and various wr drummers ; replace them , and this is what you come up with . i almost had to turn it off when i heard those `` cheezy '' electric keyboard settings on a couple of tracks . a second listen ( i always listen at least twice before getting rid of a recording ) , confirmed my initial assessment . mr. mcbride is a monster bass player , but this was almost embarrassing ; he would have been much better off actually hooking up with shorter , zawinul , and company in a weather report revisited project . that would be really good
