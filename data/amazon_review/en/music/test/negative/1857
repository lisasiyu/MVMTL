better than first album there 's a reason you do n't know much about his earlier career . if you want to listen to a sucky indulgent late 60 's california band , get quicksilver messenger service first album . at least sailor had a minor hit ( living in the usa ) . i would be more lenient if this was the first album . seeds of potential can be heard on some of the tracks , but he 's got a long way to go . he must have been connected , i would not have let him record another album after the first . but , good thing they did because he was much better in the 70 's .
