sepultura 's worst attempt . this has to be one of the worst albums i have ever heard . i got this album for my birthday as i was and still am a keen listener of metal and heavy metal music . i have albums of metallica , queens of the stone age , faith no more , nine inch nails , marilyn manson , slayer , korn , slipknot and disturbed that i like , but sepultura 's against is a joke . the first track seems promissing with some cool guitar riffs and a solid heavy rythm . afterwards , it just goes downhill . every song seemed to mimic the next , with its repetative guitar solos and awful vocals from derrick 'the d ! * $ ' green . sepultura were a much better band with max cavalera and now the lead singer sounds like he has no teeth . all of my friends ( who are metal heads ) agree with me 100 % that this is sepultura 's worst album . totally dreadful . after 10 minutes of flicking through each song , i had to stop it , take it out and throw it out the window . my advice : avoid
