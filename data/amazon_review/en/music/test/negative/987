what happened morten ? sirenia is the only band who has never produced a song i did n't like -- until now . i bought this new release expecting to love it all , with one or two epics like euphoria , sister nightfall , or lithium and a lover . what did i get instead ? -- 46 minutes of pop radio . gone is the violin , and rare is morten 's voice . we get a bunch of monika ( who has a solid voice , but every song sounded the same ) . please , morten , tell us this is an early april fool 's joke and that the real release is coming out april 2 .
