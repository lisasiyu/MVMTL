no so interesting my wife introduced my to tift merritt 's music when we were dating ... so i 've got a soft spot for tift and was really looking forward to hearing her second album , tambourine . i 'm disapointed . there 's not mush to this album . it 's lost the alt-country sound and is more of a boring pop album . bramble rose is much , much more interesting
