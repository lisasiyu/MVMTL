lackluster greatest hits the exclusion of one of reba 's true greatest hits `` till you love me '' and the inclusion of such wretched tunes as `` why have n't i heard from you '' and `` one honest heart '' makes me want to just cry . this is a lackluster greatest hits album not noteworthy by any means .
