lil ' kim ... notorious for making horrid music . biggie put her on the map . why , i 'll never know . so she sucked off the fame he gave her ( not the only thing she 's been sucking ) also , being a biggie fan , the name of this cd ( proving my point about biggie ) was offensive and disrespectful . this is not rap , this is pop . if you think this is rap , you need to get smacked with a `` the lost children of babylon '' album and learn real rap . nothing but two dollar trash by a two dollar wh*re
