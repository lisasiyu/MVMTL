disappointed i bought this cd based on the reviews for my 2 yr. old . some songs are okay but the lyrics on some of the others do not make much sense . my daughter was scared by the way a few songs turn from a soft tone to a loud shout by the end of the song . ( `` there 's a little wheel a-turnin in my heart '' and `` pig on her head '' ) . i really did n't like `` i 'm a mess '' which sounds like a heavy-rock/rap and also scared my daughter . i would recommend instead karyn henley 's cds which i found to be the best out there for the toddler age group ( 3-5 yrs ) . she tells stories between some of the songs which really engages my daughter . the songs are wholesome and innocent
