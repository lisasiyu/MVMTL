the worst of gm this is a very simple review . call it a warning . this album by gm is cheesy , period . the squeaky vocals and the weak synth lines are far inferior to gm 's other album , `` from here to eternity . '' on that cd , the tracks are very trancy , features electro vocals and nice chord changes . the beat is stronger and harder . especially good , besides the title track , is track # 6 : `` first hand experience in second hand love . '' excellent techno riff that lacks the cheesey vocals , dated expose sound effects and stabs . it just rolls and rolls and rolls . nice driving cd . however , e=mc2 is a cd to pass on . i was very disappointed . one more note , this album sounds old and dated . `` eternity '' could still work a dancefloor now . no one would think it 's almost 30 years old
