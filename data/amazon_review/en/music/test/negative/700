moron 5 this type of music is like a blister on the brain . you ca n't get rid of it and it is irritating . yes , this is the problem with most fm radio when this cd from 4 years ago is still getting played . and the tune to `` this love '' is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word . moron 5 rank up there with gwen stefani and black eyes peas for most annoying , successful artists
