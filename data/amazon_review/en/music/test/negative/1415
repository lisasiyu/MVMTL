too many re-recordings for my taste that 's right , this is a collection of mostly the 60 's countrypolitan stereo remakes of the 1950 's classics with a sprinkling of originals from the 1960 's but the re-recordings are definitely enough to let you all know that this cd is not recommended and that i recommend the legacy & quot ; look what thoughts will do & quot ; 2 cd set with only the originals . it may be a little higher priced but it delivers what it promises , the originals . the disc is rated 1 star for the heavy amount of re-recordings ( many awful performances ) and another star for the sprinkling of originals
