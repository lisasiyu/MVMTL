absolute disappointment - beware ! i am a huge fan of enigma and have all four of their previous albums , which are absolutely excellent . this is why i was so disappointed with this one . it is random and directionless and much of it sounds like individual band members tuning up . the entire album is pervaded by a supremely annoying , harsh , distorted electronic sound that grates on the ears . it seems to me that in this music michael cretu has become a modern-day german full of angst and self pity that no one could care less about . boredom and annoyance are the two lasting impressions of this album
