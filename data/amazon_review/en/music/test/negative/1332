its okay ya this cd is okay . its just really generic nu-metal . i like nu-metal a lot its just some it sounds the same and brings nothing new and that is linken park . i do n't hate this , i just think it is kind of boring and not that cool . partially why this does not get 3 stars is that since this band got so big for a while you kind of expect it to be great nu-metal , but its just plain . not great , not terrible
