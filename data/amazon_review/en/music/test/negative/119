very disappointing i was extremely disappointed by this album . it just did n't grab me at all like fallen did . it has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable . i guess nightwish has spoiled me . before , evanescence was about the only female-fronted band i cared to listen to . now that i have discovered nightwish , evanescence just seems useless . sorry , but i just do n't care for it
