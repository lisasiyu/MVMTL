not horrible , but not great either i wo n't say this was a horrible cd because it was n't , it 's just when you 've heard enough good bass 'n nova/jazzanova albums , you will realize that this album can not compare to the others that are out there on the market . most of the songs on this album do n't grab your attention the way they do on really great albums ( and you all know what i mean - you know that feeling when you pop in a cd for the first time and just get hooked by the addictiveness of a great album ? - well folks that 's what i 'm talking about ) . unfortunately this album failed to deliver that effect . it 's too bad because the artwork on the cover is really nice , not to mention the fact that putumayo usually puts together an enjoyable , reliable series of world music . the inside of this cd also has a booklet which tells you a little bit about the artists and the songs , which is always nice to know . having been an avid listener of brazilian music my entire life , i am enjoying the transition of old meets new in brazilian electronic music . it does n't have the annoying , frantic beats that american techno/trance music has . rather it is a simple , but truly enjoyable blend of samba and bossa nova mixed with modern and futuristic electronica dance beats and sounds . however if you really want to find out more about this new wave in brazilian music , i would recommend checking out another album . although this album has a decent lineup of new brazilian electronic bass 'n nova/jazzanova artists , it does n't take advantage of showcasing any of their good songs
