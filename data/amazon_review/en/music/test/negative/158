to be honest ... not the best score i 've ever heard . certainly not bad , some tracks were very nice . unfortunately , a good deal of them are too action-oriented for my liking , or simply boring . the best piece of music from the film , the beautifully haunting female chorus played over the spider pit scene ( best part of the movie ! ) , is sadly nowhere to be found on this disc . i do n't doubt howard 's talent as a composer , but the music for king kong , sadly , does n't have the same bite as the movie .
