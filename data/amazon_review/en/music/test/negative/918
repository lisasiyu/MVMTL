i 'd rather listen to hilary duff review by cory rennison : major labels never cease to amaze me with their abilities to find the most generic bands out there and sign them . the kind folks over at maverick records have put out a new addition to the ongoing borefest that is mainstream music and their name is stutterfly . stutterfly has thrown together 13 tracks of power chords , angst-ridden lyrics , and song titles that are laughable at best . some things that did work for this band were the great sounding vocals , and the rare occasions on the disc when the band attempted to have some actual guitar riffs instead of power chords . there is n't really a whole lot of singing in metal these days , so it was kind of interesting hearing it on this cd , however instrumentally , there 's just nothing special here . with only a few key moments here and there , which are easily forgotten anyways , there 's really no reason to waste your time or money on this album . chances are i 'll forget this band 's name by next week
