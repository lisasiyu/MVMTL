a `` not necessary '' remake - the originals are better sorry , i thought this would be a great updated version of the classic shr music - and i was really disappointed . i do n't really understand the point of this album - why `` remake '' music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place ? i ca n't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes ( and bottom line , was n't that the point ? ) ... and listening to `` no more kings '' was downright depressing - when shr has always had the exact-opposite effect !
