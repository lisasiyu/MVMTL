open your ears , people . this record blowz . the tunes last forever -- one verse after another , same crap melody over and over , no drama , no nothing except the old ennui , which i guess is what appeals to some folks . and lenny could n't manage to sing in tune for more than three consecutive notes . he 's improved somewhat over the years , but you all really need too look up from your `` fleurs de mal '' once in awhile . poetry is poetry , music is music , and while leonard 's poetry may speak to you , his music sucks
