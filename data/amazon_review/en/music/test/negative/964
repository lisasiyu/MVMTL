not what i think of when i think manheim steamroller this was n't a bad cd , but it was not what you typically think of when you think of manheim steamroller music . i was expecting electronica patriotic music . i got a kinda old trucker country sort of music . no wonder it 's so cheap compared to the other ms cds..
