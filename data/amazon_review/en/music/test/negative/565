buffalo farts are probably more musical than this crap ! ! ! i can not belive how a band as lame as this can actually get signed to a label . they make limp bizkit look like led zeppelin and i hate limp bizkit ! i made the mistake of seeing them on craig kilborn the other night and believe it or not , they 're even worse live than in the studio . whne i hear something like this being actually called music , i almost want to ram ice picks into my eardrums so i wo n't have to hear it . if car company put out cars with the same quality standards as some of today 's band 's so-called music , we 'd all be walking or dead . this sounds like someone yelling and screaming while pushing a lawnmower . as another reviewer said , if i could give this negative stars , i would . avoid this at all cost ! !
