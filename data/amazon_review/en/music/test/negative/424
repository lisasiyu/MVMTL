metallica - 'reload ' ( elektra ) 2 1/2 stars review no.618.somewhat disappointing follow-up to their '96 'load ' cd , which was one of their better works ever , i thought . i remember so many fans commenting how let down they were when this disc first came out . it 's not so terrible , it 's just nothing to get all tanked up about . some of the tracks here , i thought were okay , are `` the memory remains '' ( love the video where marianne faithfull makes an appearance-now that 's semi-original ) , '' the unforgiven ii '' , the melodic `` where the wild things are '' and `` bad seed '' . not the worst metal release i 've ever heard , by any means . take my advise , buy a used copy of this title
