i 'm a tad disappointed ... let me start off by saying , i am a huge beyonce fan , and i am not in any way `` hating '' on her.i love her voice , her stage presence , her look ; i mean , the girl is bad ( in a good way ) ! now , with that said , i really expected more from her . like i 've read in so many people 's reviews , i heard 'deja vu ' and i just knew this album was gon na be off the hook . however , that was not the case . i really like the strength and fierceness of b-day ( i 'm all for female empowerment ) , but the songs seem really ... sloppy in a way.beyonce is a creative and talented songwriter , but on b-day its like she was writing for keshia cole ( a simpler , more 'urban ' style ) . not saying that she does n't appeal to the urban crowd , its just that beyonce is a little more sophisticated than what she 's showing us in b-day . dangerously in love was a better album . she had dance songs , love songs , feel-good songs ; it took you to so many places that few artists can go on an album . b-day did not do that for me . beyonce has the potential to produce a great album ; i 'm looking forward to her next project . sorry b , i still love you though
