buyer beware - the 2001 remaster by universal music/one way . do n't get me wrong . the music that makes up 'phantoms ' by the fixx is absolutely unique and wonderful . the one star is aimed at the corporation ( s ) that now own ( s ) these recordings . in an attempt to give the fans of this music something to enjoy , universal music/one way records has screwed this one up - bad . how ? they reversed the stereo image . to illustrate this all you need to do is imagine that guitar part that was previously known to reside on the left in the stereo spectrum - in the `` remaster '' it is now on the right . while that harmony vocal that you had previously heard on the left of the stereo spectrum is now -yup- on the right of the stereo spectrum . therefore , a complete reversal of the stereo image - in every song , from start to finish . kids , this is a major bummer . in 1984 i purchased the vinyl version of 'phantoms ' , which i grew to quickly love . so when it hit cd for the first time i added that to my library without hesitation . but like many of those recordings that were transferred from the original analog tapes to cd format in the 80 's , i found the sound of the cd lacking warmth and bass response . because of that reason i hung onto my original vinyl through the years . recently , when i learned that 'phantoms ' had been `` remastered '' and reissued - i was hoping to get the listening experience that this music so much deserved when it first hit cd . i am very sorry to say that it did n't happen with universal music 's `` remaster '' . it 's a shame . the fact that three years after the re-release ( it came out in 2001 ) no one has publicly voiced their discovery of this not insignificant error is a little surprising to me . if i had n't of a/b tested this `` remaster '' to both the original vinyl and the original cd release by mca records then i may not have caught the reversed stereo image error right away . thankfully , i did , and hopefully someone will do something about it . i would also like to point out that i am deeply disappointed that universal/one way records did not use the original liner notes for 'phantoms ' , which in essence discredits all of those people who were originally responsible for producing the music and getting it out there . i see no clear reason for leaving those people out and in their place only giving credit to the `` reissue producer '' and `` remastering engineer '' . again , all of this is regrettable and shameful because 'phantoms ' truly deserves much better .
