noise ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! although the last couple of years i mainly listen to jazz from the phenomenal period of music between the early 1950 's and late 1960 's , i am continually amazed at the abundance of quality output . the blue note re-issues of works by horace silver , lee morgan , grant green , larry young , hank mobley , art blakey and blue mitchell to just name a few are true musical expressions of a fine art . but ascension by coltrane is noise and certainly does not fit in with the works of the above artists which represented great musical milestones . only his early stuff can really be classed as music .
