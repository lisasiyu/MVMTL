wots , uh , the deal ? amazon 's review for this is ridiculous ; `` zeppelin 's one true disappointing album '' ( what about hourses of the holy , precense , in through the out door hmm ? ) `` there is some classic material here '' ? ! ? ! i have no idea what they 're talking about . this is the worst `` odds and sods '' album ever released . its truly insane to listen to this , and think this is what the band thought was good stuff to release from the vaults . it shows page 's poor mental state at the time ; he seems to have truly lost it due to heroin . or maybe this is all the stuff that was in the vaults ? that seems unlikely , but perhaps that 's the only way to explain this . did they really release everything they recorded ? the mind boggles ! nobody does that ; you do n't record 12 songs for a 12 song album , you record 30 , 35 and whittle it down to the best songs . if zeppelin truly just recorded and released everything they wrote , that would be amazing . it would be unlike any other band ever . sorry i dwell so long on that . it 's just i do not want to talk about `` the music '' on this album . its so incompatiable with zeppelin 's legacy , and it is truly a complete embarasment to the band , or it should be . this stuff does n't even qualify for the firm for gods sake ! as cynical as i am about led zeppelin , they could really get me rocking at their best ; they were majestic , mythical , and rocking , all at the same time ! they were a good band with good music , that always at least had interesting sounding material . this stuff would n't have made the grade on the sex pistols album ; its that bad . do n't buy this ; even if you 're vaguely interested , do n't buy this . if you like zeppelin , you wo n't after this ! or maybe you 'll just be a drone and use words like `` lost classic . '' if you do , you are a goofy sob
