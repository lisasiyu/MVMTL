rod is an entertainer now ... ... not a musician . what i see in the negative reviews is a desire for rod the musician to return to old form . what i detect in the positive reviews is an enjoyment of rod as an entertainer . some people value musical chops and creativity- others simply want to be nostalgic and entertained . rod converted long ago from musician to vegas entertainer . if you want a taste of some old rockers who remain creative musicians , sample robert plant 's or neil young 's latest . do n't waste your time on rod or this kitsch
