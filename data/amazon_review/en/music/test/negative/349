get the singles i saw this in a bin at wal-mart for 2.99 and decide to get it since was 2.99 . well , i want my money back . no wonder i only remembered two songs from them carmel and what would you do . i would say get the singles to carmel and call it a day . i never liked what would you do because it was contradicting ... guy at bachelor party see friend who is a stripper and tries to give her advice . wait..hello..you are were enjoying this lady removing clothes until you realized who it was . the rest of the cd is slow and boring . claudette ortiz has a great voice . she sort of sounds like beyonce in songs 12 and 14 or vice versa . save your time , energy , and money on this cd and enjoy these when they are played on the radio .
