worst choice of cd i 've ever bought ! ! having spent the better part of my life involved in the music business , i can honestly say ( my opinion only of course ) that this is the worst piece of plastic i 've ever purchased . this is the laziest , most careless , most arrogant album i 've ever heard ! ! i feel as though i 'm on `` candid camera '' and everyone who saw me purchase this album is on the floor laughing at me -- laughing the hardest is probably john waite !
