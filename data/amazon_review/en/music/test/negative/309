go buy a sinatra album every singer has his song , on this album robbie nails beyond the sea and the rest of the songs suck . louis armstrong nailed mack the knife and frank sinatra nailed it was a very good year . robbie william does not have the depth these singers have to pull off these songs . sorry . hope you did not purchase this album . you can get the finding nemo soundtrack for half the price and it has beyond the sea on it
