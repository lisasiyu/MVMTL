i had to say something ... . i have read many , but never written a review before . i felt compelled this time . i recently purchased this cd and thought it a collection of the most ridiculous music ever . there are a couple of nice tunes but what seems like it may have potential , is abruptly destroyed by some incongruent whim . thinking perhaps that i was being a musical snob , i asked the opinion of a friend . she and i laughed so hard at how awful it was , so , i went for a third opinion . the result was the same . in fact it got worse with each listening . we 've decided that it will make a nice `` booby prize '' for my next party . avoid this like the plague . it is musically inconsistent , non-relaxing and a complete source of irritation . if you want your dinner guests to leave early by all means play this
