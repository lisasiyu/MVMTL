such a let down i write from the perspective of a life-long fan . this was one of the first modern bands that i loved and i followed their every release from my preteen years onward . they seemed to never miss the mark creatively or sonically , and the increasingly strong imagination and coherence behind each record was only matched by the increasingly complex production . but on this release , they seem to have run out of ideas and melodies and passion . that hurts to say , but it is painfully true . i 'll accept this as their auto-pilot record . the reason i give it two stars is because it makes me appreciate yoshimi , an album i initially viewed as a disappointment in the shadow of the soft bulletin , as a proper album ( albiet a lateral move )
