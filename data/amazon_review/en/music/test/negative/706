not an elitist , just enjoy good music - this mostly misses . this album is , as has been mentioned before , a followup to rice 's o -- which in my estimation was an amazing cd that warranted listening to over and over again , adding to ipod playlists , creating cd 's for my wife and just generally enjoying . creative lyrics , although sometimes inscrutable ( blower 's daughter , one of my favorite songs , but what the heck is he talking about ? ! ) , made o never get old . 9 really misses the mark . it sounds like damien has gone through some relationship issues that are still quite raw ( affair , lack of passion , confusion , bitterness ? ) and although this sometimes makes for very interesting music in this case it is just too far inside the angst of damien for me to relate to . witness a sample of lyrics from the song 'rootless tree ' : so **** you , **** you , **** you and all you did n't do i said leave it , leave it , leave it it 's nothing to you and do you hate me , hate me , hate me , hate me so much that you ca n't let me out , let me out , let me out of hell when you 're around let me out , let me out , let me out hell when you 're around let me out , let me out , let me out ok then . then there is 'me , my yoke and i ' : my fall , my fall my fall gon na break ya my fall , my fall my fall gon na break your wall i 'm in , i 'm in , i 'm in like a big dog i 'm in , i 'm in , i 'm in like a big dog yeah my god , my god , my god gave me a rod my god , my god , my god gave me a rod for fishin , fishin , fishin fishin , fishin , fishin yeah starting to get the idea ? this is a self absorbed ( more than usual ) album that an angst filled `` alone in my teenage bedroom '' songwriter has written before but had the sense to not share with the world . oh , and 'sleep do n't weep ' ends with like 15 minutes of a tibetan bowl -- an annoying tone played continuously until it bores into your very skull . was rice just trying to see how much his listener 's would put up with ? having said all that , lisa hannigan shines once more in '9 crimes ' and damien complements her very well , and you may find one or two more to strike your fancy , but overall i must say that the `` emperor has no clothes '' , even if others are afraid to say it
