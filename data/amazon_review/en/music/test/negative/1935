weak selections bring the album down usually the & quot ; grammy nominees & quot ; series produces a compilation in which , understandably , some pieces are way below the others in quality . the 2001 edition suffers more than ever of this syndrome . in fact , quality is truly hard to find on this cd . under the label of & quot ; pop & quot ; several unworthy songs somehow find their way into the selections . hard to understand why , but the few decent tracks merely manage to assert that some effort was actually put into the decision . the variety of genres that appear merely confuse me about what exactly is the purpose of this cd , rather than provide a large field from which to find something that i like . the fact is , it is so broad that a fan of a particular style of music will be left utterly disappointed . 1 ) & quot ; say my name & quot ; - a normally catchy song that seems out of place on this album . 2 ) & quot ; i try & quot ; - decent effort by macy gray , but she does not deserve to win a grammy . 3 ) & quot ; music & quot ; - madonna 's new song is nothing above average . 4 ) & quot ; bye bye bye & quot ; - usually annoying 'nsync produce a better to digest single , but no reason to incorporate on this cd . 5 ) & quot ; beautiful day & quot ; - u2 's magnificent song , one of the best of the year , is one of the high points on the album . 6 ) & quot ; sexx laws & quot ; - mildly agreeable beck single similar to most of his work . 7 ) & quot ; the real slim shady & quot ; - overplayed eminem single is great , but no reason to buy this cd ; buy his album instead . 8 ) & quot ; optimistic & quot ; - extremely disappointing song from radiohead ; a definite weak point . 9 ) & quot ; you 're the one & quot ; - paul simon 's new track is enjoyable at most , but marks musical talent at its best . 10 ) & quot ; cousin dupree & quot ; - moderately bouncy music by steely dan does not justify their win . 11 ) & quot ; what a girl wants & quot ; - it is simply shameful to include such kind of bubble gum pop on a respectable compilation 12 ) & quot ; save me & quot ; - very docile and slightly unnerving song from a new artist ; decidedly bad choice . 13 ) & quot ; both sides now & quot ; - another uninspired pick ; nondescript in every way . 14 ) & quot ; oops ! i did it again ! & quot ; - britney is ok , but if she deserved a place at the grammys , it would have to be for her prevoius album . 15 ) & quot ; show me the meaning ... & quot ; - almost disturbing backstreet boys have no place in the same room with a grammy ; a ghastly song , truly repulsive . 16 ) & quot ; pinch me & quot ; - the best and the brightest on this album ; barenaked ladies truly underrated as a band , always producing high quality music . 17 ) & quot ; breathless & quot ; - the corrs are nothing spectacular , but still bearable . to make a long story short , this album is only for collectors
