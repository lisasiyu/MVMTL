should never have been made this is one of the worst compilations of 'acoustic ' or 'remixed ' music i have ever spent money on . i am a huge fan of the first compilation , metal mania : stripped . it did *not* have a `` volume 1 , the ballads '' on the cd jacket . this disc 's addition of that title , and the retro renaming of the first , was obviously a plan by the marketing types who saw the success of the first album and simply wanted to make more money . the songs are simply really , really bad versions of the originals . the scorpions ( one of my all time favorite bands ) seem more interested in having the audience or their female r & b back up singers perform the song than to sing it themselves . the remnants of ratt , warrant , and cinderella should be embarassed for doing what they 've done to their few memorable songs . a few of the tracks are decent , but overall i find this extremely poorly thought out . i would suggest you make an effort to hear as much of this album as you can before you spend money on it ; i am so dissapointed that i am not going to be purchasing another alubm for some time without real fear that it might be as poorly done as this one
