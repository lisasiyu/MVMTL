an absolute crime one of the few documentaries that has actually meant something to me and generations of like minded folks . it is such a shame that this is the best that could be done as a means of representing the movie . were kazaa alive today i would create my own cd following the chronological order of the closing credits . well , worse has been done ( i.e . bush + iraq ) so i should not complain , but instead i 'll protest and not buy this incredibly lame misrepresentation of an incredibly well made documentary
