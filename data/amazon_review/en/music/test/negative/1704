show me the meaning of being dated ... the backstreet boys are one of the most dated groups of the 1990s . lots of pop culture trends from the 90s are incredibly dated in 2006 : full house ; teenage mutant ninja turtles ; hair metal ; grunge music ; the macarena dance craze ... but out of every trend that ever occured in that decade , nothing , and i mean nothing even comes close to being anywhere near as dated as boy bands are . i recently heard the backstreet boys song `` everybody backstreet 's back '' and whoa ! ! ! it was like stepping into a time warp ! every one of these cheesy , manufactured , synthesized sound effects brought me deeper and deeper into the past , until i arrived way back in 1996 ! this was an era when genuine musical instruments were virtualy non existant , and computerized synthesizers and drum machines ruled the pop music word . sure these corny sound effects were trendy and hip in 1996 , but by 21st century standards they just seem embarrasingly dated . i can only reccommend this cd for one thing -- -- making it feel like you 're a decade back in the past . i ca n't think of any other group from the 90s that sounds more dated than these guys . `` show me the meaning of being dated is this the decade i need to be stuck in tell me why i ca n't be there where you are there 's something dated in my heart
