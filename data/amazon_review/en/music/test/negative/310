different ? nope , its the same stupid cold . yeah , this is metal madness ! ! scooter delivers such gruesome lyrics and vocals , the two guitarists do psychotic shredding riffs and blazing solos , the drummer does machine gun double bass at 400 miles per second ! ! metal is revived ! ! as you can see , i 'm joking . scooter has little baby squirel nuts , hence his super weak and annoying voice . his lyrics about `` i hate my parents , my daddy touched my privates '' tripe is nothing new , and nothing pleasing to the ears . the guitarists are very bad , they 're downtuned and they only do powerchords and do n't solo ( because they ca n't ) . the drummer is very basic , nothing special . bass ? ca n't hear it . want the best album of 2005 ? go for `` ghost reveries '' by opeth . opeth cares about music , cold only cares about fame and money .
