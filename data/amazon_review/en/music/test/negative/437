is this really brian stokes mitchell singing ? i eagerly awaited this album , ever since hearing mr. mitchell sing in the kiss me kate cd . his singing in kiss me kate is unbelievably gorgeous , with his lustrous baritone nuancing every phrase and word . the singer on this cd is hardly recognizable as the same singer . the timbre of the voice is not the same , mr. mitchell is trying to sound like a lounge singer , not the magnificent broadway star he is . i hope he does another album , the next time bringing to life great broadway songs in the style of his kiss me kate and man of la mancha performances .
