part of history but the music is very ... bad the music on this anthology disk is very bad . you have to `` want '' to like the germs . you must have alternative motives . your mind must already be set before you press `` play '' for the first time . maybe somebody cool that you know liked the germs or maybe they were name dropped in a magazine you like or that guy from the offspring wearing his blue circle logo germs t-shirt is burned deep in your psyche ... maybe you just like the name `` germs '' ? it is a cool name for a band and they do have a cool minimalist logo . if you were to first encounter this music blindfolded wearing headphones and without any knowledge that this music is the germs , you would likely rip off the headphones , take a couple asprin and run for the hills . why ? because this music is just plain bad
