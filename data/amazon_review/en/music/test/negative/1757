sorry koop i am a huge triple6 fan , especially of the founding members . these guys all have tons of tallent and impress me with almost everything they touch however this is the worst album i own by any origional 3-6 member . i tried to like it b/c of how origional tha koopsta is but every time i listen to it i find my self skipping to the next song untill i have made it thru the album in about 10 minutes . if you want a real kk album get the devils playground . thats a solid junt .
