seldom have i been this disappointed i have at least half of these armstrong 78s in my collection , and they are master pressings , not dubs . when played with a proper sized needle and equalized properly as well , they sound many times better than the tracks presented here . this collection is an inconsistent sonic mess . the timbre of the songs changes from track to track , some of the speeds are wrong , the volume levels are all over the place , and the overall listening experience is brash and painful . i do n't worry so much about surface noise , and this collection has plenty . but a bigger issue is the way the music has been eq 'd -- - in many cases an unnatural bass boost that makes the bottom end sound boxy and muddy , and which consequently makes the already-hyped highs sound even thinner and brasher by comparison . there was obviously no attempt made to properly compensate for the turnover frequencies of the original records , and it 's a big problem for me . the collection sounds like many contributors sent in material transferred/remastered 'their own way ' and the result was just thrown together as a finished product . i was very , very , very disappointed ; and feel that the inflated purchase price is not justified . the hard bound book is nice , but is mostly filled with fancy , decoratively framed pictures and montages ; very little real reading . also , after 2 or 3 'readings ' , pages began to detach . extremely cheap manufacture . the cds had glue all over them , which i had to clean off before they would even play . there is mention in the notes about 'unauthorized ' reissues done previously ; i assume they are referring to the john r. t. davies version on british label jsp , which is sonically far superior to this set , and by the way , legal according to european copyright law . well , if columbia legacy could learn how to put out a decent product , people would buy it , and they would n't have to present mr. davies ' excellent work as suspect . do n't waste your money on this one
