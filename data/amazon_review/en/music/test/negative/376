why ? this recording is just ok . i did n't see why she needed to do a cover cd patti is so much better than this and it 's not that she is singing the songs just ok it 's just that she does n't add anything different to them to make me say yeah thats it . make the next recording will be the one i can enjoy until then i guess i will put `` flame ' my favorite patti cd
