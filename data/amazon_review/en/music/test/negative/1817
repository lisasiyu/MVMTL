the luster left before this album i am amazed that this album has gotten such good reviews here . this starts kim 's long descent into his boogie demise . if you want to hear savoy brown at their finest and the music that gave them their acclaim , buy `` looking in '' and `` raw sienna '' . if you like the blues side of their music get `` blue matter '' . but by the time this album came out , the magic was gone
