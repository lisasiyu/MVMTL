dizzy up i do n't listen to this kind of music as i really hate the whole radio/alternatine scene . i worked in a music store when this album was released and must have heard it 5 or 6 times a day as we had to play new releases in the store . although there is no talent in this band vocal or instrument wise , the music made me reminisce about high school days . anyway , this was a flavor of the day type band who has been forgotten about by now . it was obviously a group created by music execs to have some radio play , milk every dime that it was worth and then thrown out like old chewing tobacco . it 's such a shame how music is being ruined like this .
