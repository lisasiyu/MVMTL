dr_bites over the years , i have tried in vain to purchase the `` real '' original version.. yes , donny osmond is decent and all.. i grew up watching him and his family on tv.. but concerning this title , they try to pass off the various versions on this site and in stores as `` the original version '' .. it 's not ... i have the `` real '' original version on vinyl.. i 've been looking to replace it on cd.. the `` real '' original has been way overshadowed , if not completely forgotten , by the various versions over the years with cast after different cast.. the `` real '' original was actually recorded and released in 1971 ( `` after '' jesus christ superstar ( 1970 ) , not before it ) .. it was performed by the joseph consortium , on scepter records , and had a black cover with a small litho-drawing of joseph in a white and gold coat.. the front of the cover had a `` flap '' that opened up and told about the album.. the `` real '' original version blows all these versions out of the water.. i know because i bought them all , in hopes that one `` was '' the real version.. i give up.. if anyone has a cassette version or a cd performed by the joseph consortium ( the `` real '' original version ) and want to part with it , leave a message here and hopefully we can hook up and work something out.. here 's to hoping.. thanks..
