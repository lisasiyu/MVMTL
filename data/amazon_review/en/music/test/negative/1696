a major disappointment to me . the worst of the morse era an album i was looking forward to greatly after the success of purpendicular . i was let down . it has in my opinion only one really great track - the first one . i tried a couple of years later to get into it again , hoping it was just my disappointment in not getting purpendicular again . i still could n't get into it . i 've read a lot of reviews that say its ' brilliant , but i just do n't see it . not recommended at all . i know a lot of `` blackmore 70 's era '' purple fans discount everything modern , but i 'm not one of them - i absolutely adored _|_ as well as bananas , but this one did absolutely nothing for me save for the first track
