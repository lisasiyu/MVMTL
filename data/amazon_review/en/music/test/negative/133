stop trying so hard brandon cruz is trying to recapture something he never had . his credibility as an artist . why else would he redo the songs written by kyle instead of writing his own ? kyle toucher was the backbone of dr. know ! i am utterly amazed at how brandon can take truly amazing songs and butcher them beyond recognition.i recommend & quot ; the best of dr. know & quot ; if you want to hear these songs as they were intended
