practice does n't always make perfect i vividly remember when this album came out , it was among a handful that ushered in the hippie era . of course one always associates the grateful dead with lsd , the hell 's angels , and poor personal hygiene . but their contribution goes far beyond that . music was the life's-blood of flower power , and what this album loudly proclaimed was that anyone , anyone , no matter how talentless and drug-addled , could start a band , provided that access to a garage was no problem . this came as welcome news to the legions of talentless , drug-addled kids who consequently folded the dead into their collective bosom . the complete absence of musicianship is precisely what made the grateful dead so appealing . their songs , both unoriginal and poorly executed , were never more complex than the average highlights crossword puzzle . chord changes seemed more like questions than statements and guitar solos wandered in a stupefied haze lacking both point and direction . most egregious of all was the singing which hovered somewhere between horrifying and unforgivable . but listen again , and remember that this album was recorded 40 years ago . then consider that the dead have toured more consistently than the stones , shlepping their zonked-out noodles from one end of the globe to the other , jamming interminably until the cows came home - presumably in an attempt to silence them . then play something recent by the dead and let the penny slowly drop . the music is still horrible and they still ca n't sing . all that work , wasted . it 's a shame . had they invested that much energy into something for which they were suited , like repairing automatic transmissions , just think how high they might have soared
