disney karaoke vol.2 [ karaoke ] quite disappointed that there are no screen lyrics available . although some say karaoke is merely singing the lyrics to the instrumental version of the song , modern day tapes and cd 's *do* include the & quot ; cdg & quot ; . disney seems to fall behind the times . you 're better off with a sing-along video -- at least then the kids might learn to read ( or at least recognize words ) . my 4 & amp ; 2 year olds would n't know what to do with just the instrumental version , of 'true ' karaoke . i do prefer vol2 over vol1 or vol3
