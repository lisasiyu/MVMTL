give this a wide berth what a hateful album this is . each song , a classic in it 's own right , eviscerated by this glorified club singer . the song `` it was a very good year '' illustrates my point , you hear williams 's voice , and it 's dire , but then to have sinatra sing on the same song so you can compare the two was folly indeed . i would be surprised if this sells even one copy , especially since the originals can be purchased for far less than this . which fool would therefore choose the talentless imitator over the original ? do yourself a favour and buy the originals if you like these songs , if you buy this people will point at you in the street and laugh
