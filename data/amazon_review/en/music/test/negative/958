worse than a bad recording pros : they sing well . cons : none of the carols are complete . they draw you in with a little teaser , tack on a big finale , then dash on to the next just as you start responding . worse , the tracks bleed into one another , so randomizing playback sounds just awful . i 'd love to have a recording of unabridged christmas carols with this caliber of musicality , but ca n't recommend this cd
