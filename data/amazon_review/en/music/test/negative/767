is this what i waited for all this time ? ? ? ? once `` let 's get free '' came out , it lauched a revolutionary group that was powerful in their lyrics and made you feel their whole message . after damn near burning another whole in this disk , i picked up their mixtape . it was alright but i was waiting for that 2nd full length album continuing from the debut album . i bought this on the 1st day it was released and was highly disappointed . most of the beats sound the same . the album length is entirely too short . i would have given this 3 stars because the album content is not awful . but dead prez loses a lot of credibility when on the same album you say `` turn off the radio '' and 5 tracks later you collaberate on a song with mr. radio himself , jay-z . that loses a star right there . was this an attempt to appeal to the very radio stations that you constantly blast for not playing real hip-hop ? well , i live in the major city of philadelphia and i have n't heard about this song burning up the airwaves nor did i hear about it topping the billboard music charts . great job , guys
