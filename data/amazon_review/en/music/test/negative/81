johnny ramone does not play electric heavy metal guitar ! ! frist of all this is an okay album do n't get me wrong , but i bought it because johnny ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really is n't . plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom , with two tin cans on a string : one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it . catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again i 'd probably just d/l essential tracks like i ca n't be and i do n't wan na be learned/i do n't wan na be tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced ramones album like end of the century or pleasant dreams
