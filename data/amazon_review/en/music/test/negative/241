wow. , this stuns me in its mediocracy this is truly one of the worst goth and related genre compilations i have ever heard . with the partial exception of disk # 2 , the songs chosen of even the best bands were among their worst or most mundane songs . it almost seems as if someone was given a list of bands and their songs and said 'pick songs to go on this album ' they put up a list of songs up on a board and picked them by randomly throwing darts at it . great bands on disk 1 , but again they picked some of the more mundane songs overall from bauhaus , legendary pink dots , die form , christian death ( disk 4 ) and some of the more classic favorites . again- on disk 2 which showed the most promise for other than the utterly mundane they had poor song choices- for example they chose 'drool ' for switchblade symphony ( which is a band i truly adore otherwise ) which is one of their least impressive and mundane songs . though they made it clear by the intro this was not just 'goth ' music , but supposed to encompass industrial and darkwave as well , i was stunned at how little gothic and darkwave music there really was- and was perplexed as to why they bothered putting metal-related bands on like two witches and several others on the compilation . a few good songs scattered on disk 2 and 3 , but why pay for 4 disks of music with some to a few good songs on each , when everything worth listening to could have just gone on 1 album ? hours of boredom listening for a few gems . for a good compilation i would recommend the goth box and the disease of lady madeline
