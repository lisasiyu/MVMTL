bonus dvd is a dud i grew up listening to bob dylan , and was really looking foward to his his new dvd , modern times , and was really disgusted when i tried the bonus dvd in two dvd players i have , and lent it to a friend to try , and neither one of us could get it to play.i should have returned it , but after my friend tried and failed to get it to play , as stated , i was just disgusted . i desided not to order any more music dvds from amazon.i must say that the music on the first dvd was great , starting with thunder on the mountain , it was good to listen to some new dylan .
