america lose focus of their strengths america 's first album from 1972 , the self-titled one , was a masterpiece . this is the third album ( as the title suggests ) from 1974 . so what 's it like ? i find that this band have very rarely focused on what they are good at , that is acoustic pop . too often they have tried to be an eerie , progressive rock band , a funk band , an adult contemporary band and what not . only the self titled album , some of it 's folow up ( homecomming ) and 'human nature ' from about 25 years later deal with what america are all about , country guys singing about countryside and birds and how we could all live a better life if we relaxed more . the problem with `` hat-trick '' is that it does n't play to america 's strengths , at all . it tries to be a progressive rcok album and mixes in all these airy-fiary psuedo-satanic lyrics into their music . like the 8-minute title track is about a broken teenage love affair , but then they start saying `` you 're a bat out of hell '' , but it does n't work . if you 're going to sing about `` bats out of hell '' sing it with conviction , like dewey sings on something like `` hangover '' , do n't sing all soft . i mean they are a soft-folk rock band trying to sing about scary monsters getting you in the middle of the night . on the plus side you get the tracks on the greatest hits album ; `` muskrat love '' , `` rainbow song '' and `` she 's gon na let you down '' , all vintage 70 's pop . i ca n't remember anything memorable from the other songs . `` green monkey '' and `` molten love '' try to sound so scary , but do n't . `` willow tree lullaby '' is the best of the rest but does n't feel like much more than a card-carrying folk track that feels rather throw-away . overall i would give the album about 3/10 ( 1.5 stars ) they never really recovered from poor directional decisions , though have made some pretty good music since , though the best album since their first album is surely `` human nature '' . that bitchin ' done , do n't hesitate to add this one to your collection and i hope you enjoy it , because , why did they make the album ? for someone out there to enjoy themselves while they listened to it . this `` old scrooge '' did n't , but hopefully you do .
