hello mediocre i 've been a beastie boys fan since i was in 8 years old . i played the cassette version of license to ill until it did nothing but make a squealing sound in my head phones . and until a while ago i would maintain to anyone that every beastie boys album was great , cool in its own right and an evolutionary step forward by some of hip hop 's most talented artists . ( get to the point . i know , i know . ) but i had never really owned `` hello nasty ' myself . it was the only one of their albums i had n't picked upon release . until recently . now , upon closer inspection reveals that there really is n't a stand out track on the whole album . `` intergalactic , '' `` body movin ' '' and `` super disco breakin ' '' may have been pseudo hits but they do n't really stand out from the rest of the album , which feels like mostly filler . decent filler , though . there are a few stinkers : `` song for the man '' ( it 's cool when they try to do new things and the lyrics are interesting , but this track is utterly skippable ) and dedication ( following house of pain 's shout out track lead is indulgent and just plain boring to listen to ) . like their previous two lps , there are a few decent instrumental track that break up the album . but in general the whole album seems to pass unnoticed . i listened to it 4 times in a row while at work an could n't really discern any standout track . but for what it 's worth , i was n't annoyed . all in all it 's cool to hear the b-boys make a cohesive album with a unique sound , but it 's not mind blowing . i 'd recommend it for serious fans and people collecting all their cds . it 's certainly wo n't detract from your collection and there will be a time you 'll want to listen to it . but i would n't expect to find yourself picking it over paul 's boutique , check your head or even to the 5 boroughs ( awesome , by the way ) for that matter .
