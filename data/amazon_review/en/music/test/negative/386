classiness and loneliness ev3 came in a time r & amp ; b tunes did n't gave to much space for funkyness , the deaprture of dawn robinson to a supposed solo career did n't hurt the group in the vocal aspect , perhaps , what went wrong in ev3 was n't the lack of another girl to make the quartet , in fact was the quality production that the group lack of . & quot ; whatever & quot ; the outstanding track of this album , was a slow funky r & amp ; b tune that somehow aimed for better airplay that it ultimate received , and of course was the only saveable track . the hole album is influence in that slow r & amp ; b beat , not the funky jams of en vogue that fans were acostume to . even the highly anticipated ballad produced by no other than david foster & quot ; too gone , too long & quot ; felt in the space of being pure pop , and pretty close too be another flop , but the voices of each en vogue member shine , specially maxine 's in the bridge part of the song , something that it 's caracteristic of ev3 is that was really crowed by filler cuts and really bad ones . in the name of music the only other joint that can be saved from being lost in creativityless , are & quot ; eyes of a child & quot ; poppy friendly song . despite the singles releases , and the later mention this album was such a dissapointment for many fans that expected a little more from the & quot ; funky divas & quot ; because after this they should be call & quot ; the amazing boring divas & quot ;
