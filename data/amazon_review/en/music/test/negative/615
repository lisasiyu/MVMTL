d-e-l i remember around 1991 , nba inside stuff did a feature on b.j . armstrong ( my favorite player ) of the chicago bulls . b.j . said that his favorite song was `` mr. dobalina '' . i remember thinking , well , if b.j . armstrong likes this guy named del tha funkee homosapien , then he must be good . and yes , del 's first album `` i wish my brother george was here '' is an absolute hands-down hip-hop classic . so i recommend that album over this one ( it 's cheap too ) . del was at his creative peak with that first album ; it featured great production from ice cube ( back when ice cube made good albums instead of movies ) . since then , his career 's been a mixed bag . his cd 's are very inconsistent . a best of cd is probably a good way to get an overview of those mixed-result cd 's . but i think you 'd also be better off buying `` deltron 3030 '' and `` i wish my brother george ... '' instead
