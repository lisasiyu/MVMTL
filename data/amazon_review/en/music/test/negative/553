borrrrrrrrring this cd is so boring . sarah mclachlan has written / performed songs before that have set people alight with her passion , her intensity , her hurt , etc ... these are very tired renditions of all-too-familiar christmas songs . sure , i can stomach a kenny rogers christmas , for some reason it just seems to make sense . but sarah mclachlan putting out a christmas album seems to be nothing more than a combination of not having new material of her own and needing some more bucks . excuse my frankness , but this album is very disappointing
