meh . basically , i think they sold out on this soundtrack . alot of the songs that are prominently featured throughout the movie are missing ( for example , sum 41 's makes no difference , mest 's what 's the dillio , bis ' detour ( do you wan na go my way ? ) ) and instead , we find alot of songs of which we simply hear clips of during the competition mixes . now , if they had actually featured the mixes in their entirety , it would be different . but instead we are left with a bunch of , quite honestly , mediocre songs
