going through the motions this is n't as bad as the garbage tracks morrison did to get out of his bang recording contract ( nothing like & quot ; ringworm & quot ; in this collection ) , but this is not even a mediocre van release . i like most of his releases , even common one , inarticulate speech , and beautiful vision . here , van just seems commited to getting the & quot ; product & quot ; out on time . down the road was much stronger , and days like this
