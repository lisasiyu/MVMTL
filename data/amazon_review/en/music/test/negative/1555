the unseen did a whoops on this one i do enjoy the first ep 's and the albums from these guys , however , this cd kinda landed way off the mark . the greatness of the past cds were the energy along with the catchy street punk sing-a-long songs . on this album the unseend didnt seem to give it much time and effort . even a new version of one of there old songs couldnt save this from being a flop . sorry guy
