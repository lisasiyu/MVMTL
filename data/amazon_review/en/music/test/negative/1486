a musician tells it like it is..rodgers rolling in his grave unfortunately , i read the other reviews posted here and bought this recording based on the glowing sentiments expressed . hmph . if this is what people think a great recording is , then musicality has certainly taken an alarming turn for the worse . a few people did mention that the voices might not be the best , but seem to think that this is a small matter . guess what -- the two lead singers are pretty darn bad , and to me it 's a big deal . they are marginal singers , at best . i can only assume that acting and dancing are valued more than truly beautiful voices anymore , and that the music is taking a back seat to more visual concerns . it was actually , quite literally , painful for me to listen to the tracks sung by riding and hayden . every time that we want a musical delivery , we 're cheated of the pay-off . rodgers and hammerstein created works of genius that are pure musical wonder , and this particular work deserves passion , feeling and true musical prowess from the performers . this recording sorely lacks these qualities . the only redeeming qualities - the singing of clive rowe as enoch snow and nice conducting in the prologue . otherwise , save your money and - no , do n't save your money - buy another recording like the old one with shirley jones and gordon macrae and listen to some good voices . really . trust me . i have a fine set of musical ears and i know voices
