what happened to louie ? ! listen ... i dont know why they put the 5 star reviews up front ( probaly to make him look good and cause they problay wrote reviews first ) but if you actually listen to this type of music , this cd really is an insult . if you think sandstorm is the greatest thing ever made , then your an insult to us listeners . the first dance cd i ever bought was infact a louie devito cd . nyc underground 3 . i loved it ! me and my friends worshipped that cd and couldnt wait till nyc 4 cameout . but as time went on and we really got into dance music ... we figured out that devito just takes the top hits from any category and crams them onto a cd . i mean common ! ... stacie orrico ! ? ? ! then people who only hear these songs in clubs or on the radio think hes the king because hes got them on his cd . do yourself a favor and dont follow cd stores 1-10 top hits concerning dance , techno , trance and so on . oh yeah.. and dont buy the cd . its sad
