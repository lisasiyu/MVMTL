the duke meets the earl i bought this album on pure speculation it was an amazon recommondation and was uncharted waters for me . owning around 200 blues albums with close to 100 of them being lps . i had never listened to either of these guys . read the reviews and seemed like it would be a good venture . received my cd figuring it would be like most blues albums and would take several listens before it would start throwing its arms around me . wrong ! this is one of the few albums i own that nails you right out of the box ! it has been in my car stereo for around a month now and shows no indication of getting old.the first three tracks are non stop adrenalin guitar work with number three at just over 15 minutes just being a total piece of work . smooth like a well aged whiskey . the final track with guest singer is one of the more haunting blues pieces i 've ever heard . it 's one of the few pieces i know that actually brings you to the edge of reverse blues and makes you feel bad this track is also in the 15 minute time slot too . all and all you can just let this cd run and it becomes nice back gound music to what ever it is you are doing . all in the way classical music does . i 'd be surpised if any one really listening to this could give a bad rap ! this is a real guitar players record
