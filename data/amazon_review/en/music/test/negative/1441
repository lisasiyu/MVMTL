concepts get better with practice i love this show ! that said , i do not care for this version of it . the inclusion of the word `` concept '' in the title means it is just that . this was , thankfully , not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song , `` one night in bangkok '' . with most broadway musicals , the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show . if you listen to the recordings of phantom , mama mia , beauty and the beast , you can discern the basic storyline of the show . listening to this particular recording of chess , though , will leave you wondering `` what was that ? '' the broadway arrival of chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers . this recording seems too much like a mish-mash of songs that do n't really relate to each other . for musical fanatics ( like myself ) , i say `` yes , you should have this recording in your collection '' , if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on broadway . if you are only buying the album because of `` one night in bangkok '' , purchase the broadway recording instead ; you 'll be much happier with the performance by phillip casnoff rather than murray head
