horrible ! ! ! ! george benson can be one of the best guitar players , make some of the best recordings , and sound so good , if he wanted to . if you think george benson is any kind of jazz , you 'd be right . he even started out playing straight ahead jazz . but by no means , is this a jazz album . many of the songs on here are horrible r & b with vocals , by benson . that 's ok if that 's what you like , but i curtainly dont . we already got enough r & b vocalists . benson is a talented man ! why does he have to lower himself to play this garbage . the only good song on this cd is softly , as in a morning sunrise ; and that 's questionable . no , george benson did not pull it off with his latest effort . benson , you got ta play some jazz . any thing else , but this . lay off the r & b vocals and show the world what a talented jazz guitarist you are
