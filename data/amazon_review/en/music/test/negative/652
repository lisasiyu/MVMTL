not worth it jessica simpson is through being famous for her `` talent '' and is now known primarily for her sex appeal and stupidity . when she started out years ago in the music business , she had a pretty good singing voice . now she 's filled up her cd 's with bubble-gum lyrics and a breathy , whispery , off-key voice . where other artists have grown in their musical talent , jessica appears to have stayed the same , and maybe even gone downhill . i do n't feel that this cd is worth the price .
