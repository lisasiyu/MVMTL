entirely unclothed emperor parading about embarassingly this is an album the enjoyment of which requires the listener to excuse him- or herself from the very smallest shred of critical intelligence . the gray & quot ; oracular & quot ; drizzle spreading dully from the 90 % asleep gob of this fatuous ennervated biped drives this listener up a tree . i 'd excuse him , but i have better things to do , like putting my head in the oven . the degree to which this album is embraced by a loving public strikes me as all the justification a person ought to need to write off the species entirely . other than that , thumbs up
