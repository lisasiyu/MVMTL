missing many songs from the film a soundtrack gets its power from the combination of images with the song . there were a lot of great songs from the movie yet they are not on this lame soundtrack . the soundtrack is okay , the best songs are from sheryl crow and hootie but the songs that are most memorable from the film are missing . i understand that there were probably licensing issues precluding use but that is what makes the soundtrack good ... to re-live the euphoria from the film
