this sucks so badly ... everyone who reviewed this piece o ' crap 1 star had the right idea . now , let me drive the point home further : this song is pathetic . billy joe should really quit whining about how he `` walks alone '' . after all , green day is on top of the music world right now in spite of being a lame nirvana retread . so sorry , but you do n't walk alone . maybe if he had the decency to admit he was only in it for the money , i would n't be so opposed to this song . i 've heard it said that this song has emotion . that 's great ... where ? i know it 's not in the bored way billy joe sings his uninspired , typical `` nobody-loves-me-even-though-i'm-also-a-rock-star-and-i-have-fans-on-the-other-end-of-the-world-but-becuase-i'm-a-sellout-i'll-sing-about-being-a-loser '' lyrics . you want emotion ? listen to bell bottom blues by derek & the dominoes . you can tell that eric clapton meant every word he said . with this annoying track , all you can tell is that green day is a highly overrated group . if they do n't stop playing this song , and fast , i do n't know what i 'll do .
