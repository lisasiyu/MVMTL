cute -- but the packaging is better than the music a lot of the performances are horrid , some of the arrangements are insipid . there ended up being about 30 tunes and songs here that were of interest -- and over 100 that i 'll never listen to again . in many ways , it 's a beautifully packaged vanity project of limited interest musically .
