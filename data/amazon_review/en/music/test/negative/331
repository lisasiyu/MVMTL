buyers beware these are the same tracks from totally buble which was released without buble 's consent . `` totally buble '' is not an album that i wanted to be released . they were songs i recorded for a film called `` totally blonde '' many years ago before i was signed to 143/reprise records . the decision to release it as an album was made by the film 's producer , and i had no control over stopping him . it is important for everyone to know , that i only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and i sincerely apologize if you purchased this album .
