? ? ? ? ? ? ? i havent listened to these guys since vaseline way back in the early 90 's ... ... ..after reading rave reviews about this album , here on amazon , i had to see what the fuss was about ... the first couple of tracks are ok ... ..especially the first one , that is the best song off the album ... .as i got further down the trackilisting , they start to all sound the same ... . how about the singer , if my memory is correct , he is that crazy looking clown like idiot with huge red puffy hair ... .. i think his voice is so stupid , its not even funny ... ..oh and the lyrics , come on now ... ..they are absolutely ridiculous if you consider yourself as one of those worm type little people , that rootes for guys like roger from the nerds ... ..this is your type of music ...
