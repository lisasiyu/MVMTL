regarding full-length `` dazz '' by brick i bought `` old school - vol . 2 '' specifically to get the full-length version of dazz by brick , among other songs . i was disappointed and angry that it was the 5 min . radio version . after reading your reviews here , i 'm glad i did n't choose to get the best of brick . though i enjoy other songs by brick , dazz is my all-time favorite . today i found the long version on the `` disco super hits '' cd . though i 'm not crazy about other songs on this cd it 's worth the money . i will be playing my dazz over and over with my sun-roof open , a smile on my face , and the wind blowing free in my hair ! : -
