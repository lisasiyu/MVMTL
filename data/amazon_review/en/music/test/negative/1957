george 's sleeping pill george harrison had incredible talents that inspired the world . he was not only a member of the beatles but he was also one of the writers . in his solo career he sang along side of bob dylan and other greats in the `` concert for bangladesh '' . . . . so just what happened ? how did this man who soared with the eagles suddenly take a nose dive and swim in the turkey droppings ? how could such a winner like george harrison create such a loser of a solo album ? my guess , maybe , it was his divorce with patti boyd at the time . perhaps it may have been because of his laryngitis , but that had already healed after he made his `` dark horse '' album . but whatever the reason , his other albums take off to the skies while this one crashes into a tree . harrison plagiarizes his own material with `` this guitar ca n't keep from crying '' which is pitiful excuse for `` while my guitar gently weeps '' . if you have a small child that can not go to sleep , just play him this song at night and the problem will be solved . the best song this album is `` you '' which is horribly mediocre but the only one that is not boring . the song `` his name is legs '' could have been a good hard rock song except that it was too repetitious and you would still get bored after the first half . the rest of the album is a giant sleeping pill . no need for over the counter insomnia medicine ! play this record before you go to bed and have a great night 's sleep !
