this is one common project that made absolutely no sense i am a common fan . i have all of his projects and go out of my way to get all the music that he is featured on or artists that he aligns himself with personally . if he 's on it or likes it , its alright at the very least . or at least thatw what i thought . this album was indeed eccentric to say the very least . unfortunately , what many do not realize , is that just because it is different does not make it good . this album is not good . the same socially conscious message is there for the most part and that is the only reason i dont give it a one . the production overall is horrible and though the message is the same , the lyrics are not quite as sharp . his worst effort clearly . some cat on this page said that it is better than can i borrow a dollar and one day it 'll all make sense ... ... ..he 's on some extremely potent narcotic drug to say that . he can not beleive that himself . that is the most single ridiculous critique of a solid hip hop album that i have ever heard . nothing personal , but i by no means agree with him and neither would any other head who has heard either of the albums . he 's crazy ! !
