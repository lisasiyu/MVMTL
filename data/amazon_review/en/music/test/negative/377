very disapointing ! ! ! ! i love patti , and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date . this one is not good at all . this a low point in patti 's career , and god knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk . live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what i can see on tv . i really wanted to like this , but `` ai n't no way '' this song should have been remade by patti and mary who has a pitch issue . if you can not do a song justice , do n't sing it ! ! ! ! ! patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers , but singing high notes do n't `` make '' a song , interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics . patti and mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register . patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one . this cd came and went , period ! i literally gave it away ! ! ! ! !
