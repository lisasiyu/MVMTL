good performance , antiquated recording my kids and i have much enjoyed this recording , but the narration is often too quiet and sounds a bit muffled . moreover , the narrator speaks with a british accent , making comprehension a bit trickier for little ones . in general , i have missed the sound quality obtained in digital recordings , so i 'm now shopping for a better recording of this wonderful piece of music
