electronic noise i got this cd from a local music store and could n't wait to listen to it . unfortunately , there is nothing good to say about this mix . please read the other reviews written by people who have evaluated this mix ( including my other reviews ) before you make your purchase on this one , and see whether you agree with their taste of music by how they have rated other mixes . you will be surprised to learn that most of the people who gave rave reviews about j.z alive mix are not into this type of music to begin with . i have never come across a compilation as bad as this one . sure you can force yourself to like it , like other reviewers , but be true to yourself . this comp . did not even give me a reason to want to give it another chance . usually there will be something , either a good track , an awesome outro/intro mix , a flow or something that pulls you to give another listen to a cd that otherwise you might think `` naaa '' . j.z 's alive mix is actually dead ; no emotion , no soul , no intelligence , just pure electronic noise
