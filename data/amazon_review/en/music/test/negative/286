kind of a drag , really note to soundtrack producers : when we buy a soundtrack with a bunch of good songs , we want to hear the songs . sure , a bunch of dialog scattered throughout is fine and fun , but not when it 's cut into the music ! ( see the soundtrack to `` jay & silent bob strike back '' for how to do it right . ) basically , what they 've done here , is try to create some new experience that is n't quite the movie and is n't quite the soundtrack . you do n't get to hear the full versions of the songs as the artists recorded them . the beginnings and the ends are crossfaded together with snippets of dialog . it 's like a soundtrack/radio drama hybrid with no plot . the dialog runs into the song , which runs into the dialog , which runs into the song , which runs into the dialog , etc. , throughout the entire cd . on the first listen , you think , `` oh , yeah , ed complaining that the zombie blew the call-and-response in 'white lines . ' that was funny ... , '' but then you 're kind of screwed for the rest of your life because the editors have mixed in the boys doing their , `` ... diggeda , diggeda , diggeda ... '' bit right into the middle of the song . if you truly want to hear 'white lines ' or any of the other tunes , you 'll have to get them elsewhere . sorry . i 'm not sure what the objective was with this disc , but if i wanted to relive the movie , i 'd pop in the dvd . if i wanted to hear the songs , i would have liked to have played the cd , but that wo n't work here . the songs and the movie dialog on this cd are like siamese twins sharing a single stomach . you get one , you get the other and there 's no separating them . this is a bummer since they 're good songs . what i 've got now is a cd novelty that i really ca n't use . i may trot it out once a year , but i 'll be disappointed every time . maybe i 'll sell it on ebay..
