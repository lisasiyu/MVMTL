oh for god sake while i am a blur fan i just can not listen to this drivel . it 's picked up this cult status among blur fans as it 's the heart-rendering story of damon albarn 's break up with then girlfriend and lead singer of wire rip-offs elastica , justine frischmann . 13 is a document of that break up and my god it 's useless self indulgence . mindless even . first we 'll start off with the singles . tender - a plodding gospel song that goes nowhere and proves that damon just ca n't hack it when it comes to soul no matter how much he protests . long winded and uninteresting coffee & tv - while i marvel at the video , i do think that that takes away from the fact that this song is very ordinary and nothing at all special . it does feature one of graham coxon 's more agreeable vocals and goes by fine enough . no distance left to run - awful . just plain awful . it never deserved to be a single . it should never have been a single . the lyrics are the most embarrassing i have ever listened to and damon 's voice is just off beyond all point . although i 'm sure those who love this album will point out that it 's supposed to represent the pain he 's going through . it just does n't work . as for the rest of the album it just a horrible mess of styles thrown together to make it sound like they 've been listening to the coolest albums around and that america 's underground is really cool which is ironic given that this band originally wanted to go against all that . people say that blur is graham 's album and this is 13 's album and while i 'm not so sure i 'd label blur graham 's album i can definitely agree with 13 being damon 's album . it 's completely self-absorbed and the music is secondary to the theme of the album which in my book is never a good thing . however there are a couple of good songs . bluremi and 1992 are toetappers and the often underrated optigan 1 . poor optigan 1 . the optigan is one of the more fascinating instruments and has a gently surreal yet antique way of sound . it 's a credit that this was made . yet it goes almost unnoticed by many because `` oh it 's just an instrumental . '' a shame that , because it sounds like everything this album is trying to be ; emotional , warm , hurt . but most of the tracks here are surrounded in half thought-out ideas , lazily produced songs and in the case of trimm trabb , nicking the opening riff of wined and dined by syd barrett . i once said that this album was a poor man 's bad moon rising ( by sonic youth ) and by god i stick to that statement . while that album had oozing soundscapes , inventive lyrics and a sense of adventure even in dealing with some similar viewpoints ( although not all ) ... ... this feels completely lazy , lyrics depressed 15 year olds would laugh at , music that does n't really do much and not a lot much else . it 's painful to say that this is the same band who an album beforehand made something that was a stroke of genius . this however is not the answer though . buy this if you are in love with damon 's ego . otherwise , do yourself a favour and buy other blur albums ( other than the great escape and leisure ) or better yet buy sonic youth 's bad moon rising . beats the hell out of this cra
