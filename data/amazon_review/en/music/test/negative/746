a big disappointment i expected alot more from the cd ! i expected more or what creedance clearwater revival was ... .the songs on the cd were n't the best & the quality of the cd was only average.this is not worth the time or the money ! and i 'm a big fan of 60 's rock ! ! try buffalo springfield , or crosby , still , nash & young or janis joplin with big brother & the holding co. and the old stand by 's : beatles & stones ! ! long live rock & roll !
