probably the most stimulating relaxation cd i 've ever heard points for the concept , but this cd kept me awake ! the crashing waves are loud and distracting , even on low volume , and the music frankly a little depressing . i actually found myself getting agitated listening to it . then again , i had some of the worst nights ' sleep ever during a vacation in belize in which i camped on the beach for a week . oddly enough , gibson 's ocean sounds works better for me , probably because there the waves are gently washing up on shore rather than smacking into rocks . if you are used to ocean sounds then natural sleep inducement may work for you , but if you 're landlocked like me you may not find it as helpful
