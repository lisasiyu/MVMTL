beware : do n't use in slot loading multi-disc cd players there was a post from another reviewer about waiting for jams in slot-loading players ... well , here you go . i would love to buy this cd , but i ca n't , because the new fiona apple dualdisc jammed my six-disc rockford fosgate in my 2005 nissan when i put it in my player in the record store parking lot ! and it took two months to have my cd player replaced . anyone who buys this format must know you are taking a 50-50 chance in damaging your cd player . i had to buy fiona again on itunes and then burn a cd for my car . a real ripoff . i hate giving bruce one star , but this rating will get others to read this post and hopefully not ruin their nissan car stereos
