why ? as other reviewers have pointed out ... ..why ? ? ? this compilation does nobody a service - it cheats longtime fans who have already purchased this material countless times in the past ( although thankfully there is n't anything unreleased here to force them to purchase it ) - and it is an unhelpful starting point for novices who are curious about joni 's brilliant catalogue . if you want to get started with joni , buy any of her albums up to court and spark . all of these are brilliant and accessible enough to make you investigate further . at least her recent beginning of survival compilation had a theme - it provided a consise representation of her geffen output so that fans who are n't too devoted did n't need to fork out for the geffen complete works box set ( although , it has to be said that the geffen stuff is complete dreck ) . this collection has no such unifying theme , other than the fact that these tracks were all selected by joni herself . big deal . seeing as she now refers to her geffen output as the most significant of her career , it 's quite clear that she is n't the best judge of her own music these days . avoid this and just work your way through her classic albums . you 'll be glad you did
