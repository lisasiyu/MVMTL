band was so bad , singer killed himself this band 's stated agenda was to create good old pop music , the kind you used to hear on the radio in the 1960s and 1970s . unfortunately , their execution was lacking . their singer and songwriter had next to no talent . his best work was singing with liz phair on a cover of `` turning japanese . '' and even that was hollow and soulless . then he killed himself and nobody cared except maybe close personal friends and relatives , but maybe not even them if they 'd heard this record . it 's that bad
