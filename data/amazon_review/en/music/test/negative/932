rhino stumbles i really expected more . rhino , the author of the stiff records and 'left of the dial ' box sets and the 'just ca n't get enough ' series assembled this tired set of eighties new wave ? wow . a third of this cd has been anthologized to death . toni basil ? men without hats ? a-ha ? modern english ? thomas dolby ? dexy 's midnight runners ? again ? ? ? where 's nena and `` 99 luftballoons '' ? i could name six more interesting choices in my sleep : pete shelley . freur . lene lovich . heaven 17 . fun boy three . blancmange . gary numan , haircut 100 and frank & moon zappa lend a breath of fresh air , and rhino does their usual stellar job of remastering , but it 's not enough . this is for the person who : a. is an extremely casual music fan ( i.e . buys a cd about every other year ) , or b. is too young to have been around when these songs were all over the airwaves . otherwise , you likely have the better stuff on this cd elsewhere , and who needs to hear `` mickey '' ever again ? ( and i mean ever again . ) if you fit one of the two profiles listed above , you 'll be completely content . if you do n't -- save your money .
