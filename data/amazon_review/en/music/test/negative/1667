disapointed this is probably the biggest disapointment i 've ever had in a cd . when i bought this i was expecting the crazy das efx from sewaside , dead serios and hold it down . if you know das efx then do n't get this album . the beats are all the same and the lyrics are wack compared to what they used to be
