if you like classical music do n't buy this cd . most of the tracks were chopped down to 3-4 minutes so some of the best parts of the compositions are missing . i do n't know what i was thinking trying to buy 40 classical songs on two cd 's . if you really want to enjoy the music you would do better to purchase a cd with fewer , but better quality tracks
