sorry..but they 're no pentangle i 've tried very hard with this album since its release , but have to disagree with most of the reviewers here . the incredible string band , pentangle , bread , love and dreams comparisons are , in my opion , wishful thinking . this is n't due to espers ability as song writers , but to their incessant use of annoying overdriven heavy metal type guitar everywhere . this ruins what is otherwise a nice album
