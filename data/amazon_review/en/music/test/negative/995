get his other cds instead this is okay but it is not the sterling brilliant work charlap does on his three previous efforts at all . get any of those instead of this one . get stardust . get somewhere . get written in the stars . any and all of those three instead of this one . another warning ... this gershwin one has the annoying copy control demon on it so when you load it onto your mp3 it skips and jumps . most annoying . whatever happen to fair use by people who buy the music ? ? ?
