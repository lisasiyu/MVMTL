*thumbs down* this cd is n't too bad but at the same time i wish i had n't bought it . i think the singer said to himself `` let 's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally '' . ( and in a realllly bad way ) oddly enough , the absolute best song these guys ever put out is n't featured on either of their cd 's . ( sweet summer ) besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song , it 's nothing like the first cd . nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of do n't stop on this cd . just kinda bland soft rock . i recommend downloading sweet summer as it is their best song by far and perhaps possibly buying the first cd , but do n't waste your time on this one
