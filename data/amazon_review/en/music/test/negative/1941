an unfortunate production the `` hardest thing '' i 've ever had to do is listen to this cd , february 28 , 2005 recently i had the misfortune to be given this cd by a homeless man . i was coming home from my job at the paper clip factory , where i put paper clips into cardboard boxes , when i passed a man asking for spare change . i apologized because i had none to give him , and he handed me this cd . `` take this , '' he said in his grizzled wino voice . `` i tried to sell it to make money for food but no one would buy it . '' so i brought the disc home and put it into my cd player while i was cooking dinner for myself and my seventeen dogs and also my latest mistress , angela adams . i wish i had not put it in the cd player , because the music that came out was really not that good . imagine if the backstreet boys met o-town for dinner , and the four least talented decided to step into the alleyway beside the restaurant for a few minutes and began to scat . n'sync hears the racket and pops in to see if their services are needed , but nick lachey steps forward and says , `` no , n'sync ! go away ! we do n't want any danceable beats or r & b flava in our music ! '' so justin timberlake and crew slink back into the empty garage next door to practice their moonwalks . not only is the 98 degrees music boring , but an examination of the cd itself reveals more issues . 1 . the font which is used to write the words `` and rising '' is an unfortunate choice . the components of the `` d '' in `` and '' are not joined as tightly as they might be , so the `` d '' looks like an `` al . '' this changes the name of the album significantly . 2 . the boys are standing in front of a wall of fire , which i assume is supposed to be a reference to their name , 98 degrees , which is a warm temperature . however , any idiot knows that fire is much hotter than 98 degrees . human beings are hotter than 98 degrees , usually by about .6 degrees , and they burn when put into fire . in fact , 98 degrees the temperature is not that hot , just like 98 degrees the performing group . 3 . several of the members appear to have gotten tattoos of the band 's name on their arms . how lame is that ? can you imagine if people in all bands did that ? i bet emma bunton would feel really lame right now , what with the spice girls having broken up and become completely irrelevant to pop culture . what 's that ? 98 degrees is no more ? no one buys their music ? nick lachey is best known as mr. jessica simpson ? ha ha ! bet you 're glad you got that tattoo now , sucker ! i recommend you not buy this cd . buy anything else instead . i hear britney spears is genius
