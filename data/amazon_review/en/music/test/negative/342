great companion to the `` ai n't i 'm a dog '' cd i got the above title from another vender and they were not able to send this one and this is absolutly the best rockabilly on record/cd . columbia records was not known for their rock and roll in the 50 's and if this is not rock and roll i do n't know what is . get this cd and the companion `` ai n't i 'm a dog '' . you 'll be glad you did
