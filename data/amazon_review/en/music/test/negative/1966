no long version of dazz here have you ever heard a song that finds its way into your head , going round and round and round - but you ca n't place the title of it , or the group ? so it was with me , and `` dazz '' , put out by a group called `` brick '' in the 70s . imagine my delight when i heard a similar track on my xm car radio , which displays the title and group of every song played . a little research , and , voila , i had found the origin of that song which was playing in my memory ... ..but , alas , the song in my memory was approximately 15 minutes long , with absolutely tremendous flute and bass solo 's . i ordered the `` best of brick '' ... ..imagine my disappointment when it turned out to be the 3-minute version of the song . subsequent research on the web , and amazon , indicates that there is currently no cd with the long track of dazz . a real shame . if you 're looking for the long version of dazz , do n't waste your money on this cd .
