superb lyrics and music - lifeless sound no doubt , these lyrics and music are superb ; after all , this is why i purchased this cd . what wonderful memories ! but , this particular cd 's sound quality is lifeless and dimensionless . i did n't intend for this cd to be simply background music , as i like to become `` drawn into '' the recording , but that 's all i can do . what a disappointment ! i have ordered many wonderful cd 's from amazon that sound great , but felt compelled to write and warn others . i give this cd at 5-star rating for its lyrics and music , but only a 1-star for it 's sound quality . with engineering like this , its no wonder so many would rather use free music-sharing services on the internet rather than make a purchase
