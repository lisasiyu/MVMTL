tough going reading this novel was slow going . as a guy , i found the lack of action stultifying , and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them . the answer to the book 's primary riddle -- who shall emma marry ? -- becomes obvious early on , and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered . there 's a bit of local and historical color , but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of , say , a summer outing . not one of jane austen 's best
