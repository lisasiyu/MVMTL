utter garbage , cheap record company oh , i see ... issue the original uk version with 4 songs , but leave off the u.s. version 5 or so songs ? and you have plenty of room to fit them all ( because the u.s. version clocks in at under 44 minutes , so adding 4 more tracks would have been a piece of cake ) ? just more scumbag tactics from record companies reissuing cd 's . strummer is rolling in his grave . just say no , and stop buying the music from these scam record companies . if you must buy used , so they wo n't get your dough !
