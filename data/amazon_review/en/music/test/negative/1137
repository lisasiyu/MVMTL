danger danger - self-titled ( sony ) first cd of five titles this worthless fourth-rate glam metal band had bothered to put out. can not believe they lasted that long.i remember seeing these guys open for alice cooper on his 'trash ' tour.talk about your suck-support acts.simply love some of the song titles here , like their mtv video `` naughty naughty '' and `` bang bang '' .like , how long did it take for them to think those up ? other hair bands i do n't care for include trixter , warrant ( after cd no.2 ) and firehouse.total waste of time , money and effort.i 've heard some patrons compare this band to the likes of white lion , faster pussycat or poison.do n't you dare ! danger danger does n't even come close.avoid at all costs
