brainwashed anthem for the neo-conservatives wow . where do i even begin ? it is sad to think that so many americans are as misinformed about iraq and the war on terror as this darryl worley is . first off , i do n't know anyone who is saying `` you should n't worry about bin laden . '' if anything people against the war in iraq wanted our government to spend more time and efforts tracking down al-qaeda 's leader . the fact that bush jr. will not make the hunt for bin laden his # 1 priority is one of the many reasons why millions of americans voted for kerry . they want a leader who will stand up and protect us from the mastermind who attacked us and not send us on a wild goose chase like what bush jr. has unfortunatly done . think for once darryl ! next , if you are going to write a song about invading iraq at least make references to it . also , now that the war in iraq and our president 's approval ratings are so low . i doubt darryl worley would ever make a sequel song about staying the course in iraq . he and his managers are probably thinking about the next tragedy to cash in on . hmmmm maybe he will $ ing about hurricane katrina next ... we have spent so-far 500 billon dollars and more than that worth in human life lost in iraq , all that in a war that `` ended '' according to our president on may 1 , 2003 . perhaps , outsourcing jobs to other countries should be extended to crappy songwriters too .
