an opera rip-off does not make you a great singer ... i was distressed and disgusted with `` sometimes i dream '' being a rip-off of `` e lucevan le stelle '' , from tosca . he 's not the singer for me ... .and his cover of `` nights in white satin '' was very ho-hum . justin hayward should have stayed with the moody blues for that one
