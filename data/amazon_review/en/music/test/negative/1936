mozart for masochists i love glenn gould -- when he 's playing bach , that is . but gould hated mozart , and while some of his early mozart recordings are quite nice , the mozart recordings he did in the 60 's and 70 's ( i.e. , on these discs ) were simply bizarre . and not in a good way . they are exhibitions in spite , and spite is not fun to listen to . granted , some of the slow movements are played beautifully -- but there 's more to mozart than slow movements . the fast movements ( i.e. , two thirds of the music in the average sonata ) are a horror . if you want to hear gould at his eccentric best , buy anything he did with bach -- or his haydn albums , his early beethoven sonatas ( avoid sonata no . 23 , though ) , his sibelius , scriabin , schoenberg or his byrd & gibbons albums . but stay clear of mozart .
