bor-ring after first buying wr 's `` heavy weather '' i 'd have to say that this album really disappointed me . now it does have it 's moments ( nubian sundance ) , but all in all , i 'm just not feeling this one.i did n't like the sound quality ... but it wasnt all about that though . as opposed to `` heavy weather '' songs like `` cucumber slumber '' sound dated ... kinda puts me in the mind of a bad 70 's blaxploitation movie , while other songs just plain put me to sleep . basically it just does n't have that funky/rock/jazzy sound that jaco pastorius brought to the mix .
