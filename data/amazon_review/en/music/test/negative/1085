i did n't believe a word of it ... hated the `tunes ' ... was thoroughly bored there 's a myth going around that jarvis cocker is some amazing poet , immortalising the average and championing the silent kitchenette majority . there is an equally prevalent myth that he tapped into a musical vein that discovered something new in old synthesized sounds and cheesily orchestrated compositions . in actual fact he both is , and has done , neither . this record is consequently as bland as it deserves to be . it is truly a non-event and should be avoided without giving it a second thought . the observations cocker is lauded for could be written by any 15 yr old public school boy who has watched coronation street or the royle family on uk tv -- possibly more authentically and possibly better . musically it 's pretty much the same deal . you feel like asking him `` what do you listen to for pleasure , jarvis ? it certainly ca n't be hackneyed crap like this . '' the whole thing sounds like early scott walker trying to do a number on a modern northern city ... pretending , sub joyce , that he casting it into an immortal and tragic frame . the problem is that jarvis has no muse . there is certainly no bloom to lift the themes and you 're left with a sense of dull ideas penned on the back of write-up from q magazine . i 'm sure this cd will appeal to someone somewhere . good luck to them and bon voyage . perhaps i 'm just too bored with mediocre efforts to lift my attention and join the party . jo whiley can probably fill-in for me while i 'm away doing something more interesting .
