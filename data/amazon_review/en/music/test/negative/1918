music to listen to while watching whales die in the 1970s and 1980s i bought most of the ecm catalog as albums were released . this was the first one i actually hated . i also hated jan garbarek 's & quot ; afric pepperbird & quot ; but was already a garbarek fan from & quot ; dansere & quot ; and & quot ; witchi-tai-to & quot ; and if i had listened to & quot ; afric pepperbird & quot ; first , i might never have bought other garbarek albums , as i have never purchased another stanko recording . it is common to comment on a trumpet player 's technique , but stanko has none upon which to comment . for reference , my preferred trumpeters are kenny wheeler and roy hargrove
