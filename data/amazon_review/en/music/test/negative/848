not for my son ! my mother-in-law bought this soundtrack for my son who is 4 years old . we trusted that since this was a disney/pixar movie that the sound track would be appropriate for kids as the movie is geared towards children . however , there is a song on there by chingy ( who i not heard of until we heard this soundtrack ) that is very sexualy suggestive . here is one verse from the song . i like the way you look in them pants , see ya fine ( fine ) lil momma a quarter piece , she far from a dime ( dime ) the type of girl that 'll getcha ' up and go make you grind ( grind ) i 'm thinkin ' about snatchin ' her up , dirty , makin ' her mine look at her hips , ( what ? ) look at her legs , ai n't she stacked ? ( stacked ) i sure would n't mind hittin ' that from the back ( back ) i like it when i touch it cuz she moan a l'il bit jeans saggin ' so i can see her thong a l'il bit i know you grown a little bit , twenty years old , you legal do n't trip off my people , just hop in the regal i swooped on her like an eagle swoopin ' down on its prey i know you popular , but you gon ' be famous today i am appalled that such a song would be on this soundtrack . if your children are older and you do n't mind this kind of music i would recommend this cd as the rest of the songs are really good . however if your children are young and you do n't wish for them to be exposed to this type of song i would strongly not recommend this cd
