oh , wow , another band with just 2 members ... somebody call queens of the stone age and tell them that death from above stole their equipment ... and their licks . is there room for another qotsa ? probably . what i 'm wondering is why this is n't found all over cheeseball commercial radio stations . but then , this is n't quite the adolescent , swoon-inducing caterwaul of , say , sickly sweet dollboys fall out boy or the faux-heavy attention-spanless swill of mascara-dowsed cherubs hawthorne heights . death from above , while not at all mind-expanding , truly is heavy and heavy is not light , and light is bright and bright light breeds happy thoughts and happy thoughts are a preteen girl 's wet dream . so , while it 's a perfect match for formaldehyde-smoking jocks and tuba-sized bong-owning dropouts , it does n't quite fly with the doll-collecting crowd . and who knows , i have n't seen what the band members look like ; maybe they all have buckteeth , receding hairlines and crossed eyes and that 's why they did n't get a trl invite .
