where is the best song on this whole soundtrack ? i 'm not buying this cd because i just found out it 's mortal coil 's track which is missing which completely ruins the whole cd . that song is so beautiful . why is it not on the cd ? that 's why i 'm giving it one star although the other music used was highly effective
