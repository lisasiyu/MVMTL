`` -i- am spock-tacus ! '' you can bet that if peter david had lifted a cliche as hoary as the `` i am spartacus '' moment for one of his stories , he would have at least given a nod to his source ! spock as messiah became fairly tedious , as did the rehash of 'old codger from ost becoming a liability and then proving himself ' plot line from relics . dry , humorless , with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick . i just do n't get why mr. friedman is so popular . i 've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the st fiction offerings in the last few years - kevin ryan , peter david , greg cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit , heart and intelligence . like another reviewer here , i keep trying to like this author 's books since he is so prolific , but damn it , jim , star trek fiction should never be a chore
