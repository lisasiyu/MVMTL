a major let-down ! it was water-down metal ! actually ... .it is s***t metal ! ! ! ! ! i purchased this album when it came out , i listened to it once and threw it in the garbage afterwards . it was that bad ! ! ! it didnt have any of the catchy riffs of the earlier misfits . and the drums ! ... the drums of the old misfits gave it a unique sound ... and this one ! it was second-rate heavy metal/thrash drumming . this album was a terrible , terrible disappointment . i could not believe i spent my money on this album . it is a lame , sad and pathetic attempt at resurrecting the glory of the old misfits ... ..this album and the ones after this , proves this to be true .
