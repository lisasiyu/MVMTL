`` tallahassee pain ... .in the @ $ $ '' let me just say that , while i do n't own the album , i did buy it for my wife . she loves it . that does n't say too much for her taste in music , though . she also loves akon ... i was born and raised in tallahassee . i listened to an interview that this overly-cocky s.o.b . gave , where he called all the artists in t-town crabs in a bucket , and that he had to struggle and fight to make it out . that he was the first artist to ever make it big out of the capital city . there are a couple of issues with that . like mainly the fact that he was n't first , or even in the top 5 . you may have to go back a little ways , but all you really need to do is check out a dead prez song called ( of all things ) `` tallahassee dayz '' . stic.man himself went to rickards high school on tally-ho 's south side . so , he ( t-pain ) needs to get his history straightend up first before he decides to go on national radio and embarrass himself ( again , and again , and every time they play his damn songs ) . oh , three more things : 1 ) that video he claimed he shot in tally was shot in atl , 2 ) i would n't have given this any stars if i could 've avoided it , and 3 ) i do n't know what he 's talking about , but there ai n't no strip clubs where i 'm from..
