if this is the real thing i 'll pass i guess some people out there actually liked this , but not here . `` from out of nowhere '' is somewhat decent , but after that the rest of this blows dead bears . i especially hate `` epic '' which if not for this the group would never had made it . i guess because of the diversity to the song that made it popular , but it made me want to gag , and then vomit as the song does n't make sense to me for starters , and in the key of e , and just droning on and on for over 5 minutes that it 's worse than the gas chamber . after that it just got worse . 17 years has come and gone , and it still stinks .
