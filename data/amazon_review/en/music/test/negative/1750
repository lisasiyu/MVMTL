not as good as i 'd hoped i liked early winger , mainly their hit singles but the entire `` in the heart of the young '' album was pretty good , if straying a little too close to def leppard . i have to say that those works have n't stayed with me , and are only worth a listen when i 'm in exactly the right mood . `` pull '' saw a darker , blusier side and was all the better for it . in the end , however , only `` down incognito '' and the fantasticly rockin ' leppard-esque `` junkyard dog '' remain with me to this day . i skipped winger altogether until i read the reviews posted for iv . i thought i 'd give them a try , hoping this time a modernized winger would create a catchy yet serious side that held out through the whole album . sadly , iv falls into the same category as an english journalist once said of british cooking : `` fine preparation , but desperately in need of spice . '' the musicmanship is top notch as are kip 's vocals , the latter of which remain strong and with the same great range he 's always had . but where did the great riffs go ? iv is a softly bubbling pot of an album . there are no songs that really make your ears perk and demand a 2nd or 3rd listen before moving on . conspicuous by their absense are any lasting , ear-grabbing riffs to pull you in and demand you jam along . sorry to say , it 's an album of well-crafted filler
