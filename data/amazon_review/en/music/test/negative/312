dear hipster : why read this review -- you 're going to buy it anyway when i saw the futureheads at chicago 's empty bottle in 2004 , it was a revelation of jumproping vocal harmonies , savage guitar abuse and anthemic absurdity . the band 's self-titled debut album was just as exciting . the futureheads have barely stopped touring since , and it shows . all of their technical craft remains evident on news & tributes , but there are few if any memorable moments . the songwriting just is n't there . and believe me : the band knows it . at this year 's pitchfork festival , they played perhaps three songs from n & t , choosing to lean on the older , tighter , hookier material . want a great new rock album ? go buy the tokyo police club ep .
