a poor man 's michael jackson meets r.kelly prince is talented , though i ca n't remember when i last heard it because he has dropped plenty of wack music for a really , really long time.in hindsight he is basically a musical version of puffy.meaning while prince can play , he ai n't never done anything remotely original.he was in the late 70 's through the 80 's a poor man 's michael jackson.then fast forward to the 90 's on this long-winded album he was trying to jack r.kelly 's style.interesting irony is that michael jackson & r.kelly could do prince 's whole thing in there sleep , but when he tired to emulate them he comes across even more corny than he already is.he will touch the king of pop mj & the king of r & b r.kelly so maybe in the future prince will find some originality ? ? i doubt it.he just bites off everyone.wasted talent
