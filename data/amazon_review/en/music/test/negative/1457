ack ... eject ! you see the name andrew lloyd webber and assume it ca n't be horrible right ? wrong ! when i put this cd into my player i was horrified . some of the music was ok , but most of it was awful and cheesy . the london cast putting on southern accents are really bad . the lead character swallow , has a voice made for a high school production , but not a soundtrack like this . this is not typical alw , musical theater , or good music . this is good milk gone sour . i do however like the voice of the character amos ( pronounced in this cd as ay-moss ) which is why my favorite song is `` tire tracks and broken hearts '' i suggest this for collectors , and alw fans , but do n't expect the normal , this is a new rock-christian alw .
