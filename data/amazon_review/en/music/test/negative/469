try this idea for the yank market , jon do n't offer this release as an album and make us buy an overpriced cd single with it to get the christmas disc . instead , bring the `` 3 ships '' album back out with however many of these songs will fit as `` bonus tracks '' . from what most customers are saying here , this release was a dud . fortunately i still have the lp version of `` ships '' that they really seem to want . today i dug it out , made mp3s and burned that to a cdr . which i will gladly destroy when i see `` 3 ships ( bonus tracks '' show up here for me to buy . this may be non-pc , but can i get an ay-men ?
