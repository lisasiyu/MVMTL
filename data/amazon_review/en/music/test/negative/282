all hype i bought this album because i am so into sigur ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews i read say that `` ... if you like sigur ros you will like mbv.. '' let me say this album is no where near a sigur ros experience . if i could compare them to anyone it would be very early cocteau twins , though i must be clear i do n't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of elizabeth fraser . it would be more palatable if the production value was higher ... .it sounds terrible . the sound quality is comparable to some old vhs tapes i have from the mid 80 's that i recorded off the tv ( then soaked in water for a few days ! ) .
