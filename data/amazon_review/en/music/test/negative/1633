journey no longer knows how to rock on this atrocious album i 've never had this album , never thought about getting this album , and never would touch this album with a ten foot pole . journey by this time in their career , decided that they did n't want to rock out anymore . this is just saccharin sweet pop music for teenage girls . like a previous reviewer said , this sounds like a steve perry album with the journey name on it . i thought they were starting a decline with the release of escape , but even back then they could actually rock on occasion . these mostly are just syrupy ballads or just weak songs in general . steve perry was the shot in the arm that journey needed back in 1978 , but with this release he 's kind of in charge of the downfall , also . if you like to rock out , this ai n't the album to get , so basically take my advice and stay far away from raised on radio
