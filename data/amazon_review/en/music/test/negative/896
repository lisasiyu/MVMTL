dull music for elderly people , why the 5 stars ? i bought this album because i love charlie haden 's tone , and was impressed by the inclusion of the very fast playing alto saxist miguel zenon and pianist gonzalo rubalcaba in the credits . but why were they hired ? there 's hardly any need in the bland arrangements for more than competent amateurs . it certainly needs a singer and a rocket up the band . i am so puzzled by the five star reviews that i went back and switched on the cd . the track i picked at random was nice , but i could n't face a second , and played a fall record instead to wake me up . i shall try again , but it seems a bit dreary .
