does n't quite hit the mark i 've purchased the original pcm encoded cd more than once because i enjoy this album so much . i was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that i still ca n't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc . why would you disable that option ? i guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the cd . the recording label obviously wants the quick income of reselling this album without having to put any effort into remixing it or adding content
