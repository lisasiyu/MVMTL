spectrum too sweet this recording has a lot to answer for , having spawned literally a thousand similar relaxation records . i bought it enthusiastically in the mid-seventies . how has it aged ? not very well , i`m afraid , the passing years revealing all too well its lack of musical substance . i will not deny that it may relax children and musically uneducated adults . but i can not stomach his pretense that this western diatonic scale rambling is being linked to the actual activity of the chakra system . this is the stuff confusion is made of , and halpern would deserve more than two stars if he simply stuck with his ability to compose harmless relaxation pieces , not calling it music with actual ability to heal
