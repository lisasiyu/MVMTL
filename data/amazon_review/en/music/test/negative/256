they 've finally dissapointed me i feel like crying right now , literally . i suppose that i saw this coming , even though i 'd give anything to avoid it : the goo goo dolls have straight up sold out , and no other band could dissapoint me more than they could . the goo goo dolls were the sole band that brought me through my teens , and probably had the single most early influence on my taste in music . no other band had the intensity , musically and emotionally , that these guys captured on their earlier albums ( albums like jed , hold me up , superstar carwash , or a boy named goo for all of you who started with dizzy ) . the complete lack of words to describe the feeling a certain song gives you -- you know what i 'm talking about- these guys had it in everything they did . had it , past tense . their progression that critics tote as `` maturing , '' alas , was the dolls slow descent into what they 've become now . we ( longtime fans ) saw it and silently groaned to ourselves , not able to admit to ourselves that it was happening . it started with dizzy up the girl ( with what , for or five singles ? get serious ) . do n't get me wrong , i enjoy that album , but only because it still has some of the magic that made the goo goo dolls what they were . the songs still felt real . gutterflower was the real omen ; but at least the songs were still somewhat interesting , musically . and so it comes to this , another great band ruining itself . trust me , i tried desperately to like this cd . desperately . but it does n't feel real . the lyrics are cheesy . the musicianship is way below par ( as compard to their creative ability and talent ) . the songs are forgetable and all sound the same . the only song i found somewhat enjoyable was `` listen . '' ( the only taste of real ggd i could find on this cd ) . ( and only two songs with robby on vocals ? its a shame . his raspy voice is beautiful . ) its hurts me immensely to say these things about john and robby . they 've been my idols for more than half of my life . it feels like a part of me is dead . sounds cheesy , but the ggd have never dissapointed me . time to face up to the facts : they finally have . i guess all good things come to an end . so if you want to hear some good music , go to the used cd store and pick up superstar carwash , and hear what this really great band used to sound like .
