the most overrated album in history ! never a beach boys fan i had to listen to this much hyped album after hearing rave reviews . what a dissapointment . i just do n't get it . & quot ; god only knows & quot ; is indeed a masterpiece , but the rest of the album is filled with boring music that does nothing for me . i 've tried multiple listenings to make sure i 'm not missing anything , but the plain truth is that this album stinks . i was expecting some deep music as described by some beach boys fans , but the best use i can get out of this album is using it as a coaster . in a word , boring
