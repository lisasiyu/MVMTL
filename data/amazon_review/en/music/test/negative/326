what a horrible album usually i skip over album reviews if they are too extreme ( 5 or 1 star ) . but it 's quite called for here . can a man rap with any less charisma ? ? ! ! cam 's come quite a long ways , as evidenced by this album . average production . uninspired , generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content . the production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it 's not on purpose . an amateur job all around . it would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape . there 's definitely growing pains all throughout . skip to his later selection
