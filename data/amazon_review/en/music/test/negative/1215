definitely not an original band i bought this cd cuz i love the black betty tune ... w/great expectation i figured their other material was gon na blow me away ... wrong ... ram jam should have named themselves rip-off jam ... .after listening to this cd i have concluded that they didnt't have an original bone in their bodies ... the songs were a mishmash of blatant allman/skynyrd/blackfoot attempts ... the vocals were without energy or feel ... i can understand why they wernt sucessful where others were
