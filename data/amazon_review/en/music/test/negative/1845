my sacrifice -- listening to this album ahhh , the long awaited scott stapp solo album . the resurgence of scott stapp begs the immediate question -- is there anything scott stapp ca n't do ? the answer is invariably yes : sing , write decent songs , or stay out of jail . lets start with the album cover and the goofy aramaic looking symbol behind him . when loosely translated , the writing reads the phrase `` i 'm a tool . '' though i 'll have to give him credit , i was expecting the album cover to be a picture of him nailed to a cross . instead he went with a tastful picture of himself dressed like a biker and posing like he 's being voilated by a [ ... ] thermometer . for all those folks out there looking for that `` inspiration '' they all seem to find in stapp 's lyrics , i suggest you get some inspiration from the business end of a lousiville slugger . maybe then you wo n't reach out to the psuedo-christian rocker that got arrested on his wedding day . and i do n't even have to mention the video of him and kid rock having sex with groupies .
