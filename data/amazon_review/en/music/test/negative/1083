wildly overrated ! the fact that as of this writing 20+ copies are available new and used at big discounts might be a warning sign . the big-concept selling point here is that on this album pwr was finally freed to be his highly original self , and played tunes by ornette coleman , coltrane , and monk ( along with his more standard fare ) . however , on these supposed epochal encounters with the ultra-moderns , he does little more than state the themes as written , with no improvisation at all on two and minimal improvisation on the third . critics whom i trust praised this highly , and i bought it on their recommendation -- my mistake ; do n't make it
