how dissapointing i find it hard to believe that the same band who put out the heavy metal classic `` burn my eyes '' and the strong follow-up `` the more things change '' , would suddenly sink into the nu-metal trash . to be honest , most nu-metal that i actually like , i would n't buy a cd from ( the nu-metal cds i do have are from my nu-metal phase ) . the awesome riffs , the cool solos , the sweet drumming , and a band who had a message about society have been pushed aside here for power chords , rapping , and self loathing lyrics . i gave this 2 stars because i like 2 or 3 songs on here , but one of those 3 songs is a cover . when i saw the music video for `` from this day '' , it almost made me want to slap rob in the face . he went from a tall , powerful metalhead to a stupid , trendy , spiky-haired w igger . they would get worse on `` supercharger '' , but thank god that machine head recovered on `` through the ashes of the empires '' . this is not a good place to start for machine head at all . get their first 2 albums and their new one to hear rob and the gang as a post thrash/groove metal powerhouse , not a nu-metal slump
