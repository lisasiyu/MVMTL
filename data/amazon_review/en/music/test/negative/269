would the real sting please stand up ? is it just me , or do all sting 's new songs these days sound basically the same ? i 've loved sting 's quirky , compelling - and not infrequently erudite - songwriting and music-making as far back as i can remember , from early police through to 'ten summoner 's tales ' - but every time i listen to one of the newer albums , i just get a feeling of wading through formless aural goo that refuses to coalesce into anything resembling a distinctive voice or vision . i do n't want sting to make part 2 of 'turtles ' or 'summoner ' ( artists have to evolve and explore to be worth listening to ) but i miss the clever playfulness of 'englishman ' or 'heavy cloud ' , the sombre poetry and sweeping thematic unity of the whole 'soul cages ' album and the heartbreaking simplicity of 'fragile ' or 'fields of gold ' - i miss the way the music and words *worked* together , and the way there was always one more thing lurking below the surface if you listened carefully enough , or a cleverer musical joke than you 'd initially caught . the point is , 'sacred love ' , 'brand new day ' - and even 'mercury falling ' - could have been made by anyone - there just is n't anything that separates these songs ( okay , except maybe 'desert rose ' and 'thousand years ' ) from easy listening elevator music , nothing that makes them sting 's and not just another faceless product that exists mainly as background to a slickly edited music video . even the outrage seems carefully calibrated -'this war ' is certainly no 'russians ' ( even discounting the brilliantly quoted prokofiev theme ) , and the extra verbiage is neither forceful nor intelligent enough to induce me to actually listen , as opposed to letting it play in the background . on the plus side , i am looking forward to getting hold of the new album of elizabethan songs - sting certainly has the musical smarts to take on such a challenge , and i 'm keen to see how he handles the delivery of the music . but i 'll still miss the old sting - the one who could make me dive into a book to check a reference while simultaneously making music that always had something new to offer - and i 'll continue to live in hope
