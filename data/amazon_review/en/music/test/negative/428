letdown the first album was so good - walking the fine line between cheesy pop and beautiful sentiment . this one is just all cheese . the guitars have been replaced with 80 's ( the bad 80 's ) sounding synthesizers and the hooks , which may still be there , are just buried under layer after layer of production . i ca n't even believe this is the same band . i played it for several friends who i turned on to the delays without telling them who this was . the reception was..uh..not good
