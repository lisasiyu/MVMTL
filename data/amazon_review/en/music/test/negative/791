continual slide mack 10 seems to have lost it . like ice cube with war and peace , he tries to sound hard with an edge but you can tell he 's trying too hard . he seems to have lost his hunger along with ice cube after the westside connection album . this is probably 10 's worst album has he continues to fall . wc 's the only hope for the old westside connection . mack 10 's gangsta believability is very very questionable after putting out a pretty lousy album here
