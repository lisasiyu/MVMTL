not even for gertrude lawrence fans ! this cd is shamefully misleading ! it only features snipets of the original score and two members of the original cast . in fact , there is more dialogue than music on this cd ! worse , it sound like somebody dug up a set of '78s they found buried at the bottom of their gandfather 's trunk and decided to record them on cd , scratches , pops , and all ! i am a huge fan of gertie lawrence , but even i did n't have the nerve to play this cd more than once ! pick up the royal national theatre 's production instead
