atrocious noise reduction job i 'm appalled this cd is still in print using the same horrid transfers sony made in 1991 . the major label philosophy at that time was , `` eliminate any and all trace of hiss or crackle from the original 78 , no matter if it totally kills the music in the process . '' great progress has been made since that time in the development of technology to transfer 78s without destroying the music , but has sony bothered to create a new remaster ? no . they are still pressing new cds from the original 1991 transfers and they sound horrid . save your money , i beg of you , and wait for somebody to do this material correctly . this release is a disgrace .
