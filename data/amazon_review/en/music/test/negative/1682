oh , no ; not these guys again ... i 'll admit it ; i never was much of a pretty ricky fan , especially after listening to bluestars . i mean , i like sex as much as the next guy , but that seemed to be all these guys ever talked about -- and it did n't help that they have very , very below-average rapping skills ( and pleasure 's singing is pretty okay ) . and this trend continues on late night special . now , i wo n't say that nobody likes pretty ricky ; after all , this album did debut at # 1 on the billboard 200 . but i have to say that this is another one of those cases where i looked at the other reviews and now i 'm asking , `` did we all listen to the same album ? '' and aside from all the usual sexual talk , the guys still rely on dated rhymes , like `` let me do you after school like some homework '' ( `` leave it all up to you '' ) , `` you got me feenin ' like jodeci '' ( `` love like honey '' ) , and , once again , `` if i 'm lyin ' , i 'm flyin ' '' ( the title track ) . as was the case with the first album , the guys are n't very impressive when they do n't talk about sex either , mainly because considering the way they normally rap ( lyrics and style ) , it 's kind of hard to then take them seriously ( especially slick ) . this is evident on `` stay '' ( but pleasure 's singing is pretty god-awful on that song too ) and the necessary song about clubbing , `` push it baby '' . and `` so confused '' is aptly titled because the chorus is about being in love with a girl who 's taken , but then the verses contain their usual dirty talk . this album also contains a pretty statutory song , the aforementioned `` leave it all up to you '' . but in the long run , maybe that is n't horrible because teenage girls are probably the only people that 'll pick up this album . like i said before , i have nothing against sex , but if that 's all you talk about and you 're wack , then it 's really a turnoff . i 'm going to have to pass on this late night special and see what else is on the menu . anthony ruper
