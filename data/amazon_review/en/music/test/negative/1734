pretend this one was n't made i have not heard kerplunk , but probably out of dookie , insomniac , nimrod , warning , and american idiot , this is the only one i would truly label as bad ( nimrod was better , but not great either ) . the sound is very forced . green day admitted that they tried to make it darker sounding to lash out at fans who criticized them as sellouts . it also was trying a little too hard to preserve the `` i 'm still punk '' notion which fortunately green day gave up years later . i have known for a long time that billie joe was never the best guitar player , ( except the guitar playing is pretty good now ) and brain stew 's refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad . it sounded even worse in the live album , bullet in the bible . geek stink breath is really the only other song on this album i liked . however , its too short and the guitar playing way too simple . in general , unless you are a major green day fan , there really is n't much you 're missing in this album .
