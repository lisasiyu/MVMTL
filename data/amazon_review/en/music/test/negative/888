big disappointment i 've loved some of shakira 's previous songs , and when i heard `` hips do n't lie '' , and the fabulous `` do n't bother '' ( i love those lyrics ) , i just had to get the album . i put it off for a while , but saw it at a semi-reasonable price , and bought it . my oh my . it is n't good ! ! ! the only two standout tracks on the album are the two previously mentioned tracks . i listened it to it twice . normally i can love an album on first listen , very rarely will i get bored of it on a second listen . nope , not with this one . shakira has a lovely voice , but the rest of the tracks are nowhere near as upbeat as `` hips do n't lie '' and `` do n't bother '' . do n't bother buying this album unless you are a true , die hard fan of shakira . do n't waste your money
