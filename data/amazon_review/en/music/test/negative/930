this is a farce , part one by 1976 , somebody had the rather strange idea of tearing apart the australian version of `` high voltage '' and `` t.n.t '' , ac/dc 's first two albums , and then sew some of the pieces together into this hodgepodge . who 's to blame for this rip off ? . somebody at atlantic records ? . some members of ac/dc ? . maybe both ? . who cares anyway ? . certainly the late bon scott , a man who never minced words , was not particularly delirious about this idea . as he bitterly screamed in the title track of `` dirty deeds done dirt cheap '' : `` neck ties , contracts , high voltage , done dirt cheap ! '' . now that i 've got used to the aussie albums , listening back to this `` product '' feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated , low quality spirits . even the front cover is ridiculous . perhaps those who conceived it intended to capture angus young 's manic frenzy on stage . but the result is hilarious : a picture of angus young looking like a retard holding an obviously fake , broken gibson sg . a real broken guitar would have saved the day ( just a little bit ) . every enthusiastic record collector knows that both atlantic records ( now warner music ) and epic records ( now sony music ) are serious labels that took , and still take risks , by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will . so , it seems that , with their approval of this re-issue , the surviving members of ac/dc are the ones to blame for this farce to go on , and on , and on ... if this is so ... well ... guys , we , the fans , made you filthy rich . we deserve the `` real deals '' , available worldwide , at a `` reasonable price '' . a final word about this re-issue : i do n't own it . in the words of pete townshend , i `` wo n't get fooled again '' . alas , there are no bonus tracks , nor previously unreleased material . for reasons unknown to me , the surviving members of ac/dc seem quite apprehensive about sharing a bit more of their music with us ( both warner music and sony music are reissuing classic albums with tons of bonus/previously unreleased material ) . if bon scott ( undisputedly the band 's most uncompromising member ever ) , was still alive , i believe things would be different . by the way , if you are interested in the real stuff , please be so kind as to read my review of `` .t.n.t . ( import ) '' . other items to be avoided : the skimpy `` retrospective '' ep `` '74 jaibreak '' , and `` bonfire '' , a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice , in different versions . none of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of ac/dc 's first four aussie albums
