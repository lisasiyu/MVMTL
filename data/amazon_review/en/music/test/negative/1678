the 10 cd 30th anniversary collection is a better choice . i do n't really disagree with the other reviewers ' evaluation of piaf . she is truly one of the great artists of the 20th century . i got this set ; and then i got the 10 cd 30th anniversary collection . this 2 cd set has only a few songs recorded in the late 50 's and early 60 's when recording technology could do justice to her voice . the 10 cd set has several cd 's recorded toward the end of her career . the recorded sound is outstanding ; and piaf was still in great voice nearly 'til the end . i know the 10 cd is expensive ; but i prefer it above anything else i have by piaf
