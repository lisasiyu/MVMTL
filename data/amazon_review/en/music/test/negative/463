the downfall of fall out boy ... this might be a `` great '' cd to some people , and it might be good in your eyes , but it is blasphemy to good music . why do n't you guys try bands like black flag , the sex pistols , the misfits , maybe even my personal favorite 90 's grunge , i.e . nirvana . fall out is so whiny , i 'd like to give a thumbs down , for the future of good music do n't buy this cd
