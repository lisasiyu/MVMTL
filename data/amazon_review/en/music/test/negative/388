a bit disappointed i went into this a pretty big golden smog fan eager for a new effort from the guys . with tweedy 's songwriting having taken a great upward swing in recent years and with louris ' departure from the jayhawks , i was hoping we 'd see a few more tweedy gems and some great tunes from the past few years since louris ' `` rainy day music '' was released . now , while there are some really good songs here , nothing really comes close to the `` red-headed stepchilds , '' `` radio kings , '' or `` jennifer save mes . '' the album lacks something but i ca n't put my finger on it . it almost sounds like a band that has too much focus . considering golden smog started as a buncha musician friends sitting around , drinking beer , and goofing off , this album feels wrong . it does n't have that sing-along feel ( with the exception of possibly one or two songs ) that the first couple albums ( and even ep ) had . just a little lackluster and , considering the amount of louris has his hand in on this one , almost comes off as an album of jayhawks throw-aways
