fool me once , shame on you ... this had the sacd logo sticker on the cover and the way the logo is designed , implied that this was in 5:1 . shame on you . it is in stereo . i have always enjoyed this album that came out when i was in high school and have a stereo copy already . when i saw it in the sacd section of best buy , i thought it would be the livin end to have it in surround sound ! it was a severe disappointment to see that it says stereo in small letters on the back after i had opened it already . if i had n't opened it , i would have returned it . why bother putting out a sacd if it is only in stereo ? ?
