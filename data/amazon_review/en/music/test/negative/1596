buyer beware huge camouflage fan ! so , needless to say , i was very excited to learn that there was a best of cd/dvd compination available . i have been into the group from the very beginning , but unfortunately , had never seen many of their videos . thanks mtv . anyway , i ordered rewind-the best of 95-87 to catch up on all the videos that i had never seen . i received the disc and promptly placed it into my dvd player ( panasonic ) . it would not play the disc , `` unable to read format '' . ok , i tried my second dvd/vcr combo , it will play anything ... ..no , not this time . `` format : unrecognizable '' . i tried the disc on three other players ( samsung , hitachi , and a portable sony ) , all to no avail . i finally placed it in my imac , my last hope . it said that it would not read as a dvd , but it could play it in another format . meaning , it will play the disc , but as a computer image , not as a true dvd . the picture was very small and quite grainy . so i still got to see the videos , but not in the format that i had hoped . i just wanted to pass this information on to other fans of the band . it is a risky purchase , and a pricey one at that
