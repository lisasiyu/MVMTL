why , india , why ? ? ? ? i 'm a massive , huge , big-time india fan . i have every release and have witnessed her powerful live performances from nyc to miami , but i must say that i 'm not feeling this cd . it sounds a bit rushed and her vocals seem to be recorded diffrently than usual , not as strong . i love the title track as well as `` cuando hieres a una mujer '' and `` no es lo mismo '' . that 's 3 good ones out of 11 songs . this from an artist that has released cd 's that you can listen to from beginning to end . i do n't even know what to say about `` madre e hija aka madre '' , although i think the sentiment is sweet , it 's comes across corny . now that we 've lost celia , i was hoping that she would raise the bar a bit and drop an unique , beautilfully produced cd . i figured she would snatch salsa back from reggaeton and create a classic in the vein of ms. cruz . i 'm a bit dissapointed that she 's still singing about lost love and scorned lovers . i thought after her great sony release `` mi alma y mi corazon '' we 'd get amazing material ... ... and what happened with sony anyway ? ? ? now she 's with univision ? ! ? ! india-i still admire you and i 'll always support your work ... ..spoken like a true fan .
