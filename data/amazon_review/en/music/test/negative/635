avoid aside from the song , `` brother '' , this cd is not worth your money . i 'm not attacking these guys on a personal level , but anyone that appreciates music will see this cd has no flow . it sounds as if a few guys got together and created some decent riffs and then hastily hired a singer to apply lyrics so they could pump the thing out . the result is just as i said ; a few good bass and guitar riffs and lyrics with religious overtones and no feel to the whole thing . there is nothing clever or conceptual about their music . nothing lasting or memorable . nothing worth your hard earned $ . if this band has as much talent as the reviews that i read here all seem to say , where is the 2nd release ? there wo n't be one
