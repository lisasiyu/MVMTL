mrs. blue bird saves the day i bought this cd thinking that the songs , production , harmonies , or something would have been along the same lines as the ballroom considering curt boettcher 's involvment ... ..wrong ! in my opinion mrs. blue bird is the only worthwhile song on this disc , and it itself is only a marginal song , sorry . i was hoping they were n't going to be some rip off of the sunshine company . they 're not at all , but maybe should have been . i guess i was hoping for something that rocked a little bit , or had some killer harmonies , or some off the wall arrangements , or was at least up-tempo sometimes . again , in my opinion , besides blue bird , the songs are very draggy and slow . i 've tried , i 've listened to the disc serveral times to give it a change to grow on me . not going to happen . my apologies .
