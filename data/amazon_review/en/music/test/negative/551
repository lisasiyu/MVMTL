they were too lazy to score new music ... . so the creators of this show paid a lot of money to various record companies to feature songs on the tv show soundtrack and hardly if ever used new music that they themselves would compose or not . it is really product placement of the worst kind . be lazy and let other recording artists do the work for you , considering that this stupid show was made the way it was , it was not surpiseing that they reverted to this just to save money
