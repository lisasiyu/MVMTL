great idea ... so so execution i do n't get all the rave reviews here . i 've owned this cd since it came out in 1997 and its been probably more than 5 years since i had a desire to listen to it . now listening to it trying to figure out what i want to put on my i-pod and i really ca n't find anything other than the 1st 2 tracks , which are great . the filter/crystal method track is a classic . but beyond that i just find the songs somewhere between mildly interesting and boring . i am a fan of many of the rock & electronic artists here , but this experiment just did n't pan out in my opinion . it 's been 10 years and i have n't seen any other collections like this so i must not be in the minority . nice try , but there is not much more here beyond the concept
