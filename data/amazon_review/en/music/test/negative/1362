oh no , its ice cream music 21/2 scoops out of five . obviously some very talented players here , some moments of complexity here and there , but the material is poopy . for my personal tatse , this would get a big fat lonely star , but it 's not really bad music , i just could not get it . the production is typical of early 90 's , way overdone , shiny , artificial , there 's no proper spacial imagery at all . can you say compression ? yuck . not the greasy , sweaty funk from the 70 's . made me think of being in an ice cream parlor at times . were these tracks leftovers from bad 1989-90 sessions or what
