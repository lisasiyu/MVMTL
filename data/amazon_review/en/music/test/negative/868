a big let down ! i bought this cd a while back and it was a complete let down from what i thought it would be . the commercials made it look so good and made it sound really good . the commercials depicted at least 45 seconds of good music from the cd , and that is about all i found . on both cds combined there are like 2 songs that are ok . i bought the cd , walked out to my car , popped it in , and listened . an hour later i got out of my car and took the cd back ( or tried to really ) . now the only thing i use the cd for is to watch the little movie clip of the hot girl on the second cd . all in all , a big let down
