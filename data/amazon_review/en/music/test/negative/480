remastered ? and what for ? i 'd have expected some noise reduction in the songs of the first cd ( for example , try the partisan ) . the original recordings were noisy . this remastered version keeps all the noise , but now the sound is even poorer than in previous releases . all in all , the selected songs are a good representation of cohen 's musical career
