perfectly dreadful if celebrated film director ed wood ( plan 9 from outer space ) made an album , it would sound like this . the transformed man by william shatner is n't flawed or ill-conceived , it 's perfectly dreadful , reaching sublime and awe-inspiring new heights of schlock . each passing minute finds listeners recoiling in astonishment as they struggle to believe their ears . this smorgasbord of embarrassing implausibility and pompousness is only possible through the offices of shatner 's hideously bloated ego which has blinded him to the project 's breathtaking stupidity . if the phrase , `` so bad it 's good , '' is in your lexicon , the transformed man just might be your guy .
