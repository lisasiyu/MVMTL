suicide at a time when fine music is fighting for its life , haroncourt delivers this . the sound is crystalline . every voice is heard . the performance is dead , dead , dead . for the good of music , harononcourt should remove the key that winds his clockwork heart and throw it away . this is the most lifeless performance of the mozart requiem on disk . many more like this and classical music will be dead -- it can take only so many defeats
