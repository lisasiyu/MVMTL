a dissapointment do n't get me wrong , i love brian stokes mitchell . his deep voice is intoxicating and beautiful , which was why this cd was such a dissapointment . all his songs are high and do not show off his wonderful low voice . mitchell should stick to what he does best and it is not covers of songs made for tenors . i hope his next album will be more fit for his voice , i 'll be the first in line
