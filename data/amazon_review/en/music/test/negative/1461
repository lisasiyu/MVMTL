it 's about time for trent to retire to the producing world . . . this album was an absolute disappointment . i 've never thought of a nine inch nails album as fun , but the only redeeming quality for with teeth is that some of the songs ( `` only '' , `` you know who you are '' ) are just fun . the others fall somewhere in the realm of pretentious , irritating , or just plain bad . here are the main problems , as i see them : 1 . lyrics - this should come as no suprise , though , as trent was never a poet . take love/sex , add addiction , frustration , inadequacy , failure , deviance , etc. , and you have 80 % of the nine inch nails songs ever written . additionally , trent can not sing . . . or scream ! ! ! his range lies somewhere around mumble and whine . this is easy to see past when the music is good , but not on this album . 2 . lack of complexity - nin has always been interesting , if not good , musically . trent laid on the synth layers thick , and it was possible to listen to an album ( the fragile ) many times and keep noticing new things he was doing musically . that does n't happen here -- this is very one-dimensional and boring . 3 . not innovative - nin was good because he/they did things that no one had done before musically , and that in and of itself was exciting . nin never sounded like anything else , though there were a lot of knock-offs in his/their wake . either the technology is so accessible that everyone is doing what nin used to be the only ones to do , or trent reznor got lazy , because this sounds like every other piece of electronic-rock crap to come out in the past decade ( except with trent reznor 's voice ) .
