turn off the tv on the radio ! this band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now , but i 'm just not feeling it . the single `` wolf like me '' is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album . it is a great song , but everything else is just blah . i think the band could use a different singer , the guy they got does n't sing very well or very `` soulful '' . the music is good , very original and the only reason i have n't sold the cd yet . i really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy . do n't be fooled by these 5 star reviews . just listen to the cd before you buy it . that 's my advice
