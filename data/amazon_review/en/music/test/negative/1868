not good , but not entirely bad . i bought this cd online but realized soon afterwards that it was hard to listen to ... but heavenbound was so impressive i can not give it a bad rating . first of all , of course it 's bad ! it was their first cd , it was the late '80s and kevin was not a prominent member . but rewind , give them grace and see how far they 've come , and you 'll appreciate how they started out , however bad it was . however , i see no reason for anyone but a die-hard fan to buy this cd . compared to the other incredible selection of christian music that is out now , it 's a pitiful little dot in the corner . but it signifies the start of successful christian rap/hip hop , so it 's pretty interesting as far as christian music history goes . but like i said , it 's not worth it if you do n't know the group . do n't `` start here '' , and in fact , do n't even really end here . it 's more interesting than `` good '' . overall , it 's not the greatest ... but if you think it 's worth the buy for heavenbound , then do it , because the song is really lyrically great
