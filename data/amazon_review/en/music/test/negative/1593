a disco christmas - ack ! i love christmas . i love the festive atmosphere . i love the spirit of giving and i love christmas music . this stuff , however , is downright painful to listen to . a few tracks , with the slower tempo , can be tolerated in small doses , but the more `` upbeat '' number are too awash in synthesizer arrangements and come across as little more than `` a disco christmas '' and severely test my love for the music of the season . destined for shopping mall pa systems everywhere
