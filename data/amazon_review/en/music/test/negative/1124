love the music , dislike the dual disc i really enjoyed the music , once i resigned myself to playing it on my dvd player when the cd would not play for me . i was disappointed the cd would not play . if i had known there would be a problem , i would have just ordered the regular cd . jane monheit has some classic christmas tunes , as well as some lesser-known ones , such as `` the man with the bag '' which i thoroughly enjoy . i do n't find the melisma as bothersome as some other reviewers do . it does n't seem distracting and allows her to make the songs her own . just for fun , i checked out the `` live '' performances and was unimpressed . with so many music videos that have high production value , her videos feel gimmicky at best and simply can not compete . in addition , her lip-syncing seems amateurish . i can not recommend this feature at all , thus my two star rating on this item . my advice : by the regular cd . i plan to send this dual disc back , if amazon will accept it , and get the regular cd . that way i can listen to it in my car and have the ability to put in on shuffle with some of my other favorite holiday tunes , which is why i bought it in the first place . i 'm sure her cd will become one of my family 's holiday staples
