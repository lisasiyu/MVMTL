put together too quickly and it shows ! ! ! ! ! first of all , let me say that i think billy klippert should have been the canadian idol . buy his album as it is far more superior to this one in every way . now , objectively speaking , i do believe ryan malcolm has a nice voice in its natural range , but at times ryan is stretching it in this album . i believe most of the songs sound the same , and truly there is just not enough variety on this album , at times i feel like im listening to elevator music . i think if the producers took alittle more time constructing this album the result wouldve been alot better . now i do think his release single & quot ; something more & quot ; is catchy , nice hooks and sentimental lyrics , but unfortunately its the only gem on this album . buy the single and forget the album . i believe canadian idol fans should give billy 's new album a try , you wont be disappointed ! ! ! ! !
