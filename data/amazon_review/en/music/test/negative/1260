ridin low living legends was good but did you think that puffy was going to let this legendary duo out of memphis make another album without a harmful pop vibe attached to it ? you dont know pus daddy very well . relax and take notes , cruisin , runnin out of bud , get low and stand up are the only tracks that are worth checking out . this is the rest of the album . filler : ridin high ( fruity commercial joint , sounds forced , i hate puffy so much right now ) , 30 rocks ( the hook doesnt make any sense plus who told diddy kong it was cool to bust a verse ? ) , hickory dickory dock ( worst hook since ... ... .yung joc 's i know you see it ! ) , clap on ( speak of the devil , dumb joc makes a lame appearance on this dead track ) , memphis ( sampling a hillbilly tune ? who let them do it ? the worst ode to a city ever ) , alcohol p**** and weed ( worst hook next to hickory dickory dock ) etc . bottom line : this is the worst album ball & g ever made . their rhymes and hooks for most of the songs were weak and their guest appearances were pretty tame . signing with puffy at the time might have been a good look for them now its a negative look for them . puff dookie cant stand to have rappers on his label that are not as commercial and pop as he is . if the first boyz n da hood was alright you can almost imagine how bad the next one is going to sound . support every album eightball and mjg made on suavehouse records ( including in our lifetime , their best album ) and stay away from this train wreck of an album .
