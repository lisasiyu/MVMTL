avoid the cd ! ok , i figure if you 're looking at this cd , you 're a laurie anderson fan and can recall at least twice you 've seen her great concert movie , likely at a midnight showing back in the 80 's . well , if you 're that person , avoid the utter heartbreak which is this cd . i counted 18 tracks from my old vhs copy of this concert , while only 8 made it to the cd . the banter between tracks is omitted entirely . the tracks are out of order ( ok , small nitpick ) , and it 's certainly not worth the effort . i 'm sorry , laurie , but warner scr-wed you hard on this one . on the up side , the sound quality is good , certainly better than my vhs . but hey , this is a concert film soundtrack , but apparently they forgot to include the second disk . laurie fans will be livid . ( others merely confused ! :
