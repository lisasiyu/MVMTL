what happened ? i really liked tevin campbell in disney 's `` a goofy movie '' . it made the movie really special . but now when i go and see what his old cds were like , they sound almost nothing like the guy . the music is way too slow paced and his voice sounds bored and well ... like it 's just dragging on and on . maybe it was because the music was more upbeat and bassey -- not to mention totally cool in the movie . i only gave the cd two stars because of his terrific performance in `` a goofy movie '' . check out that cd if you want to see the best of tevin
