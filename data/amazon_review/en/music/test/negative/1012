sadly disappointed i purchased this album with such high hopes and when i popped it in to give it a listen , i was sadly disappointed . it was not the dj shadow that i knew . the majority of the tracks were rap , which would have been just fine if it had been good rap . it had no flow , no connection and was all over the place . i took a risk and purchased this album without looking at the reviews and i 'm sorry i did . always read the reviews ! ! ! !
