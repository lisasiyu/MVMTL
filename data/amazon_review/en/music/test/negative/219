pompous , self indulgent drivel ! just like the beatles , led zeppelin in most peoples eyes can do no wrong . sorry they can and this along with 'in through the outdoor ' is a band so full of self importance that they can serve up drivel like this and go platinum . i mean if any other band served up psuedo raggae ( d'yer maker ) , a funk james brown catastrophe ( the crunge ) , half finished songs ( dancing days , the ocean ) and a complete mish mash of ideas ( song remains the same ) it would be career suicide , not zeppelin though . i find their arrogance on this quite breathtaking . sure 'no quater ' and 'over the hills ' are great , but jesus does n't plants warblings and hippy drippy lyrics grate after a while . mind you he never was that great when compared with say paul rogers or ian gillan . the only saving grace with this is one of the greatest cover designs ever
