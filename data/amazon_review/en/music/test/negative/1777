not a great performance as a long-time fan of mountain , i found this set to be far less than satisfactory . leslie west and felix pappalardi are here , but corky laing and steve knight are absent , replaced by bob mann and alan schwartzberg , neither of whom plays well . mann 's guitar/keyboard work is surpassed in its awfulness only by schwartzberg 's drumming , which is simply dreadful . however , no one in this lineup appears to have any real enthusiasm , slogging through one ragged number after another . the version of & quot ; nantucket sleighride & quot ; is so long that it soon becomes an exercise in pure tedium ; it 's a wonder that anyone in the audience was able to stay awake all the way through . none of the other cuts on this album is much better ; in fact , the highlight is the moment during leslie 's & quot ; guitar solo & quot ; when a speaker blows ; the rest of the album merely blows . this entire set sounds like a contractual obligation , and nothing more
