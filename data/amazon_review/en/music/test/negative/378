horrible . just plain horrible . as an amazon reviewer , i have dedicated my account to providing a level-headed review of anything that i have listened to that is worth reviewing . more often than not , i will point out the good and the bad for each album as to give to the minds of those who have n't heard it yet unbiased information as to decide for themselves whether or not to purchase it . however , i believe i have actually found an album that has no redeeming value anywhere on it . chingy never was very talented , whether lyrically or flow-wise , but at least his first album had a couple enjoyable beats that pushed the limit of synthesizer use , helping make some of the song more listenable . but his follow-up is ... well , how can i describe while also being nice ... unmitigated crap . there , i used a big word in an attempt to be nice . even if you 're into the whole `` cash-money-hoes '' pop rap that 's been overtaking the mainstream , this album wo n't do a thing for you . some of these types of rapper at least incorporate some of their young `` hood '' life experiences to make it their own , but chingy , other than his nasaly , thick accent , does absolutely nothing to place his trademark on this album . all that this album offers is more generic `` i 'm rich so i 'll flaunt it until you puke '' crap . worse , the beats are unoriginal and do nothing to add to the `` music '' . i do n't even know if you can call this music , as it does not follow any of the guidelines that music sets down . chingy has no talent and no amount of argument is going to prove otherwise . i ca n't believe i once even listened to this guy . it makes me sick that people like this guy are the ones that get paid millions of dollars and sell multi-platinum records for showing absolutely no sign of musicianship at all . he and all his fellow rappers should be sent back to the hood and be forced to study music theory for the rest of their lives . and for the love of god , chingy , learn to spell ! you 're not impressing anyone with your unintelligent songs like `` wurr da git it gurlz at '' and `` fall'n '' . i do n't see what 's so hard about spelling those right . here 's a short lesson : `` where are the get it girls ? '' and `` falling '' , my god , you ca n't even spell simple words right . bottom line : there is no reason why you should buy this album . like i said , even if you absolutely adore rap and hip hop in all its forms , you most likely will not find any songs on here worth listening to even once . you 'll just find it covered in dust in your closet years from now and retch with disgust that you actually dropped full cd price for such a worthless waste of materials . for rap that actually warrants more than one listen , try busdriver or del tha funkee homosapien , who actually have lyrical prowess and interesting flow . for good music in general , listen to great metal bands like children of bodom and blind guardian , and maybe even some classical composers like dvorak and beethoven . those artists have/had more creative talent in a single atom than chingy has in his whole body . this cd gets no points whatsoever . i would also give 0 stars to it , but amazon has not yet realized that 1/5 means that there 's at least a shred of quality on it , but this album does n't even deserve it . 0/1
