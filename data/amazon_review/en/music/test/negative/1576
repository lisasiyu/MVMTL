agree . not as good as the original . every soundtrack sounds like the previous one because of slow , ponderous , heavy , sterile , dry interpretation of the themes . one just expects some brightness in the playing but this is never delivered . this recording & quot ; tries & quot ; to have a story . stick to the original soundtrack . 1000 times more enjoyable
