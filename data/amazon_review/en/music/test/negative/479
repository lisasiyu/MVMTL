yngwie malmsteen ( amazing guitarist ) hit the nail on the head to quote him , ( in the new issue of revolver magazine ) , he said ... `` i call it crap ! it really disgusts me when it starts creeping into heavy metal . mozart once said 'music is melody ; melody is music . ' talking into a microphone over a drum machine is n't musical ! rap has no melody , so it 's not music . it is completely an utterly devoid of any talent . i 'm repulsed the media glorifies it so much . '' you 're 1000000000000000000 % correct man , keep up the good work . for good rap , listen to ice-t and public enemy . for good music in general , listen to yngwie malmsteen 's solo work
