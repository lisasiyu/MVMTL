what happened ? i bought this cd when it first came out as a huge hrc fan . vagrant records also has a quality track record judging from their band roster and their ability to somehow summon up the best of a band . i thought hrc would benefit from much higher production quality as well as the influence of oustanding acts such the alkaline trio and saves the day surrounding them.. however , owning for the cd for nearly two years with many listens has made realize that the band used to create captiving , listenable hardcore is gone . nothing about this cd particularly interesting or grabbed me even on the first listen . the disc loses its appeal early as nameless , medtempo pop crowds the speakers . the vocals are more clear , however ; the trade off is less compelling melodies and a lack of creativity . tracks like & quot ; the pharmacist & quot ; identify a theme of short , competent , but boring songs . i have n't heard anything more form hrc released this album and i do n't think i would shell out 15 bucks again for something i would hear on the radio
