egotistical blowhard i went to see mato 's reinvented indigenous 2 nights ago with high expectations . i have been a fan and seen him many times with the family members that he has since dumped because someone got him to believe they were n't good enough . the sound mix was so bad it was painful to my ears , it physically hurt . mato came off so look-at-me egotistical it would have been laughable if it was n't so offensive . new band members - nothing special , certainly no great improvement from his family which he obviously does not understand was a portion of his band 's original appeal . i walked out on a 15 dollar ticket to save my ears . in the past couple days i have visited with a few people and they all said the same word `` disappointing '' . in summation - i highly recommend the early indigenous recordings . i strongly advise you to avoid the new and supposedly improved `` mato '' and any new recordings . hopefully he will come back down to earth and rediscover his roots but i doubt it . i gave 1 star only because the review format forced me to
