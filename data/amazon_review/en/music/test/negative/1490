not john lee hooker well , of course it is john lee hooker , but these slick , mushy recordings are very , very far from hooker 's gritty 40s , 50s and 60s waxings , and songs like the saccahrine , string-laden `` six-page letter '' are even wussier than the worst of his late 80s/early 90s guest star recordings . hooker obviously did n't have a chance to listen to the final mixes . whatever you do , make sure you listen to this album before buying it
