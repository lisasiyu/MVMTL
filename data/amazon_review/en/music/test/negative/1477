a grave dissapointment after all the hype i expected this disc to be great . boy was i wrong . i love the wailing souls but i can not even listen to this . what were they thinking ? ? ? a truly poor and weird output from one of my favorite reggae harmony trios . the first track , `` row fisherman '' , is such a bad version of a great song . skip this and buy firehouse rock or face the devil . even better try and find a copy of their first ( and best ) lp from 1974
