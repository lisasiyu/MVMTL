very relaxing except for the birds the sound of the water rushing over rocks on this cd is very relaxing . the only problem is it also has the sound of birds chirping which is very annoying . i did not hear these birds chirping when i first played the sound sample on amazon.com . so if you are thinking about buying the cd for the sound of water alone , you may want to look at a different cd
