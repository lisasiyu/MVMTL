well ... . dunno ... .. i used to like tiziano ferro songs . his first album was a straight hit in the face , a wow ! great dinamic songs . 111 was more normal , more calm . but this one is really really slow ... he changed his usual pop style for a r & b that does n't convince a lot . if you like calm balads or are a fan of tiziano , then you 'll like it , but if you do n't ... . better do n't buy it
