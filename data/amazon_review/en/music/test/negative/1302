no , not so great to compare this to a digweed , sasha , or nick warren mix would be very misleading . with a few exceptions ( sugarglider , mara ) , this is a very generic , flavorless trance mix . it is *not* complex . there is no groove , no soul , no build - in short , very little to keep your interest going . it 's not the trance that you 'll find on digweed-hong kong or anthony pappa - nu breed . if you 're expecting something of that quality , do n't buy this . i was very disappointed in this mix , although it did give me new appreciation for the kind of mixes created by quality djs ( not fortier )
