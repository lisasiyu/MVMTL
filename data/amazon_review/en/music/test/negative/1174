2 1/2 stars -- post punk energy music . punk , like all great rock music , was a rebellion , in this case against the excesses of the late '60s and early '70s . but somewhere along the way , it was unavoidable that bands would come along that loved the energy and honesty of punk and the very material they were rebelling against -- in the case of xtc , the lush pop and psychedelia of the late '60s . but these influences were far receeded on their debut album , `` white music '' is firmly lodged in the sounds of punk and new wave and is , more than anything else , an album of energy music . the net result of this is that hte album is inevitably at odds with the strenghts of the band -- songwriters andy partridge and colin moulding would come later to excel at lush , detailed arrangement full of unerring pop hooks , textures and harmonies , but here , it 's all very stripped back , ska and punk influenced pop . moulding 's trademark slithering bass is n't quite in place yet , though he 's already starting to find holes to fit himself in , he primarily forms a solid lockstep with drummer terry chambers . partridge 's guitar , for his part , limits largely to angular punk and ska trends -- loud and aggressive , pushing the music along from the front , which leads barry andrews ' buzzing organ sound to be largely the soloing voice in the band . but with all this , the real weakness was singing voices too used to poor microphones of cheap clubs -- partridge and moulding both use an unnatural , clipped vocal style that seems more concerned with trying to annunciate than anything else , to the detrimant of the band 's sound . with all of this creating an unnatural tension on the album , it still manages to hit pretty frequently , helped no doubt by the fact that partridge 's songwriting was already top notch . standout `` statue of liberty '' best illustrates this -- hints of ska , gentle organ textures , and a funky bassline over which partridge 's clever story of unrequited love can be read out . nearly as notable are punky opener `` radios in motion '' ( full of crackling punk energy ) , the loose-yet-detailed arrangement of early single `` this is pop ? '' ( featuring the closest partridge would ever come to snarling punk rebellion , even if it is laden with great pop hooks ) , and new wave gem `` atom age '' , with just enough of a hint of brian wilson to pull it above the rest . on the other hand , there 's a lot of largely forgettable material -- moulding 's songwriting feels like it 's not quite ready ( `` set myself on fire '' ) and his vocal is even more painfully forced than partridge 's ( `` cross wires '' ) , and even partridge has a couple duds ( `` spinning top '' ) . add to this an ill-conceived ska take on `` all along the watchtower '' that makes partridge sound like a bad hendrix imitator and you end up with a pretty mixed package . the reissue adds quite a bit to the original -- remastered sound that has the net effect of making the record sound a bit more dated than it probably would at least provides clarity to the music and there 's seven bonus tracks -- early singles and the `` 3d ep '' . most of this stuff is largely forgettable ( moulding 's `` heatwave '' , partridge 's `` dance band '' and `` traffic light rock '' ) , but early single `` science friction '' and its b-side `` she 's so square '' are pulsing full of nervous tension and energy and make a decent listen . xtc would find enormous heights in the following decade , and i ca n't help but color my reviews of their early material based on the heights they 'd eventually reach . i have a sneaking suspicion that had i not heard what they 'd be capable of in the future , i 'd be inclined to give this a much higher rating , but compared to their later work , `` white music '' sounds positively amateurish . it 's got its moments , but they 'd go on to do a lot better
