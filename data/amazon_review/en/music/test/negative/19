least favorite edwin album although it kills me to write anything less than glowing about edwin mccain ( i think he 's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we 've seen in the last ten years ) , i just can not get into this album . like others have said , i too have every edwin album and have seen him in concert . i love everything he 's ever done ... . but this album just does n't do it for me . and i know people will say ... `` give the album a chance '' ... .. or ... `` let edwin grow and move in new musical directions '' . but ... .. i 've listened to this album at least 10 times all the way through and it 's just not growing on me . it feels `` flat '' and just does n't feel edwin-ish ( if that makes any sense ) . even grammercy park hotel , which i saw him debut live and which is on his live dvd does n't feel the same on here ... . just does n't have the feeling or soul . i would pick up austin sessions over this album any day . that is edwin doing what he does best . maybe he feels the pressure to write some `` hits '' so that he does n't have to spend two solid years on the road in the black pearl ( his tour bus ) ... .. and who could blame him ? ? ? but this feels like he 's trying too hard . i soooooo hope he comes back with a better album next time , so i can rave about it , because although i gave this album 2 stars ... . edwin , as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10 ! ! ! ! ! !
