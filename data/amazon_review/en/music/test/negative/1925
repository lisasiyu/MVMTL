does n't work sorry , this cd just is n't all that and i went and bought it based on the fact that i love book of shadows and read the reviews . bls earlier stuff is awesome , and i 'm into skynyrd and allman bros. and other southern rock as well as heavier music so i thought i 'd like this . i do n't , it does n't work . zakk 's singing on this just pushes me away , or not sure what it is but the cd sounds like he wants to be bob seger - which imo is not a good thing . get book of shadows , which is excellent , or if you want other mellow metal from zakk - hangover music vol 6 blows this one away too .
