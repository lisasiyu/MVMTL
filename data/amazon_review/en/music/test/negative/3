better stoned ? um . i have nothing against bands that are `` mainstream '' . that has nothing to do with their quality of sound . ( granted , many mainstream bands are horrible , but they all deserve a chance , no ? ) dave , though , he has never impressed me . not that he 's awful , i suppose it 's okay background music ... better than nothing . just oh so mediocre . i do n't understand why is he so highly praised ? voice-wise ? eh . nothing special . lyrics ? hah ! music ? umm ... bland ? it 's all the same ! maybe i 'm missing something ? if you like one of dave 's songs , then by all means , buy this ! you can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song . two stars because it 's at least music . but that 's on the high side , considering how static it is . dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer .
