there 's nothing in here ! after all the reviews i read , this has to be one of the 'disappointing ' albums i have picked up in the recent past . the music is dated , the lyrics are poor and the overall direction seems pointless . where is eric taking his music ? i have no idea . drop it . there 's tons of better talent out there
