yukk ! ! ! she does n't sing ... she yells ! ! ! and using one of ednita 's songs as she did with `` lo que son las cosas '' is just sacrilege at its `` best '' ( or worst ) . it 's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself . she has absolutely nothing on beyonce or cristina aguilera . her cd is just plain bad ! if you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices ( and that actually sing ) , you might want to look for la lupe , celia cruz , ednita nazario and lucecita benitez ... and these are only the ones i remembered at the moment
