where 'd the rock go ? dissapointing after `` image of the invisable '' . the rest of the disc is slow . i understand an artists right to make the album the way they truly wanted to with time taken to get it just the way they invision it , which is explained in detail with a booklet with the cd , but i 'd rather they have had the deadline pressure and made another artist in the ambulance or illusion of safety . did they have to include a piano intro in almost every song on the album ? maybe the songs will grow on me , but they will never feel like the good old stuff
