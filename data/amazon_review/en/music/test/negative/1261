blame puffy it is sad that these two southern hip-hop legends good names have been blemished by bad boy records . the transformation from their classic hit `` on the outside looking in '' along with a host of other great albums to this disgrace is quite sad . i 'm sure your boy puffy offered alot more money and fame than they have ever had in the underground , and it hurt 'em . some will say `` well thats what you get for being a sell out '' but if your in the game making underground hits for almost 2 decades and your only know to a small region , you may not feel the accomplishment or respect you deserve . i forgive them , not puffy . buy some of their old stuff
