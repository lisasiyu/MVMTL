bad title , good music although i do not agree with the message this cd is trying to get across , i will say the music is great . i think rock stars/celebrities should quit pushing their views on easily persuaded 16 year olds who think of rock stars as idols . it seems people in this world do n't make up their own mind anymore , instead they are manipulated by the `` loud-mouth minority . '' get your facts straight , but in the meantime , enjoy the great music . 2 stars for good music , missing 3 stars for the stupid message they are pushing forward
