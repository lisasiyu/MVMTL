baaa baaa , music for sheep ( 0 stars ) emo noisemaking and christian themes . the two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship . face it kids this is a fad . a really pathetic fad . disco was a fad and they has thousands upon thousands of drones listening and participating in the disco scene . the same happened with hair metal and nu-metal . those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day . you will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity . as i always say in my reviews , this is trash and should be treated so accordingly . this band should take their emo wrist cutting lyrics to heart and kill themselves for the better of humanity .
