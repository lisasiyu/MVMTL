the second star is for persistance while not quite as bad as some of the stinkers which were to follow , this is another terrible effort by the so-called fab four . yesterday is instantly forgettable , dizzy miss lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the 50 's and ticket to ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly . as usual , i did enjoy ringo 's excellent drumming and i liked the song act naturally . for shame !
