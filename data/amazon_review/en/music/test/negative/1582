i wish there was a lower ranking pink sucks . this is a horrible cd and horrible albunm art work . they gave her too much freedom on this cd since mizzunderstood was a big hit . that is probably why her new song stupid girls is so catchy and sing-songy it makes me want to puke as well . but i guarantee they didnt let this wan na be riot grrrl go all hard core again . if they did , this new disc is bound to wind up in the .99 bin along with try this .
