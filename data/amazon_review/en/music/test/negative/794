the fall of hooverphonic continues once hooverphonic was a great band . their first album with the brilliant singer liesje sadonius was brilliant and also the second album was great with geike singing quite good . then came a decent third album with a couple of good moments followed bye a very dissapointing 4. album , a live album i did not want to invest in , and now this even worse album . i have heard it once , and i do n't think i will ever hear it again . not that it is horrible , but it is just not worth spending my time for , and geike has now lost all the beauty in her voice , and now sings quite badly most of the time in my opinion . i surtenly miss liesje sadonius ' beutiful voice in this band . anyone knows what has happened to her ? but back to the album and the conclusion . if you did like hooverphonics first albums best , then do not buy this and be dissapointed once again . but if you did like the 4. album , you will surely also like this .
