i 'm sorry but this album sux i listened to this album and i actually felt cancer forming in my ear drums . nelly is wack as hell period . he is the modern day version of mc hammer . take a look at the music he is making now . this album is commercial as hell but when you slide down nelly 's resume it gets even more commercial . i mean how low can you go ? country grammar has some decent beats that get professionally wasted but the number one beat waster in the world . nelly is the worst rapper actor to ever walk this earth . what we need to do to people like this is to yank him off stage and tar and feather this klown . check out real hip hop like mos def and immortal technique
