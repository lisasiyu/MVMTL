self-referential bs , and not of the good kind i 've probably listened to `` crane wife '' several dozen times ( one of the perks of working for a hipster clothing retailer ) and after rolling meloy 's lyrics around in my head for a month or so i can honestly say that he has created the pirate-prog rock song cycle of the year , which somehow is not as cool as you 'd think it might be . what i really do n't understand is the slavering fanboyism this band seems to inspire within some `` intellectual '' music fan circles . just because you need to use a dictionary to decpiher meloy 's overblown dickensian narratives does n't make them well-written or intelligent . instead `` the crane wife '' is the newest addition to the recycled 18th century story sketches meloy does n't seem to be able to depart from . maybe i 'm just too picky but lyrics such as `` produced my pistol , then my saber to make no whistle or thou will be murdered '' from `` the island '' come off as extremely silly , especially when filtered through meloy 's extremely nasal delivery . the `` crane wife '' titled-tracks produce some interesting images , but ultimately lose their effectiveness due to meloy 's weakness for 10-dollar-words . overall , the whole album sinks under the weight over over-writting , over-singing , and over-playing . meloy and co. should put down the dickens for a little while and read some william carlos williams .
