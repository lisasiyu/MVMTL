shoulds be called 0/20 this is just absolutely terrible from beginning to end . i 'm so sick of these underground d -- -riders giving this 5 stars . this is garbage . i 'd much rather listen to a good commercial rap album than this garbage . the lyrics are boring and wack , the production is bad , and the concepts are stupid . i 'm gon na go pick up cam'ron 's new album `` killa season '' next week and i suggest you go do the same . for good west coast rap , wait for ice cube 's new album that comes out june 6th . this is one of the year 's worst albums
