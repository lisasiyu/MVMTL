the 5-star reviews are complete bull does this band even know how bad they sound ? this is the same generic emo c r a p as afi , green day , and my chemical romance . they think they 're sooo clever with the song titles . yeah , right . song titles do n't need to be 1,500,000 words long . by the time they get the titles out in the refrain , the song 's over . as i have said , do n't waste your time or money . chrissy : call me out if you must , but i really do n't give a rat 's a.s.s . what you think of me . to try and derail all the people with common sense is pathetic and childish . ps : `` clueless whiner ! '' re : interesting comment , considering you spent nearly all of your `` review '' bitching about other people . who 's the whiner now
