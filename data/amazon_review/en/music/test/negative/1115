not one of live 's best . i love this band . they have an amazing amount of talent . however , this album has fallen short of their greatness . the first song is remenisent of `` the distance to here '' , but you 'll find out very quickly that this album lacks live 's creative song writing ability , and falls short of portraying their amazing talant . if you 're a hardcore fan , i would buy the album , but do n't expect greatness because it just is n't there
