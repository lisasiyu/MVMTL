rebirth , eh ? that 's both pretentious and funny . when used in the music industry , the term rebirth would indicate erasing the slate and starting anew , and presenting yourself as something different . perhaps jennifer lopez thought of this knowing that her singing career was in decline , and opted to give her fourth album the title rebirth . is there any legitimate sign of a rebirth on this album , you ask ? a few songs in , and the answer is clearly no . the songs are still built on synthetic arrangements with synths and samples where real instruments could be , the lyrics are still some of the most shallow you 'll ever hear , lopez still is n't doing much in the way of writing , and her thin voice still sounds the same way it did on her first album . you would think by now that with all the time that lopez has spent as a recording artist that some aspects of her output would have improved , but that is not the case . if the lopez faithful ( who made her first two albums multi-platinum hits ) need any proof how weak her voice is , listen to some of the songs here , including the single `` get right '' - she talks her way through a lot of these tracks . that 's right , not singing or rapping , but talking . you have to hear them to know what i mean . did you ever stop to think that she does n't perform live because she ca n't sing a note in tune ? one thing i 'll give her credit for is that at least she is n't taking advantage of her fans by performing `` live '' concerts while miming the whole thing ( like those hacks britney spears and hilary duff ) . the material is so weak that it 's little wonder why her fan base has eroded as of late , despite her high profile . in summary : not being true to its title , rebirth is instead a continuation of the weak bubblegum pop and lite r & b sounds that we 've come to expect from jennifer lopez . in short , expect more studio-enhanced singing , more synthetic music and more lyrics so weak that even black eyed peas would have rejected them . you can definitely do better than this album - just do n't expect to hear it on the `` hit music '' station
