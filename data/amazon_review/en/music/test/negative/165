give me a break normally , i am very open to listening to new music -especially scenster/indie-hop - and when , months ago now , i 'd heard about the bravery i was intrigued . i turned on the radio here in san francisco to the best indie station on the planet and kept my ears open . i remember hearing a song and thinking , `` wow , the strokes ' new song is amazingly good . '' then , when the announcer stated that the song was in fact performed by the bravery , i was horrified . simply stated : how are these guys not the strokes ? sorry , but they sound exactly like them ... but not as good . lyrically , they are not as original and the lead singer does not have the same passion or enthusiasm in his voice as the lead singer for the strokes . however , lucky for the bravery , people are actually buying that they are a unique and catchy band . what a joke
