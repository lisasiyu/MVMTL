do n't buy if you have ipod the songs on the cd are great . jane monheit has a beautiful voice and she performs several christmas classics well . this `` enhanced '' version is horrible however . sony has `` enhanced '' this version of the cd so that you can not import the music into itunes and then subsequently play it in your ipod . you can only use it in sony digital players
