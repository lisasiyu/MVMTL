a miserable , mopey masquerade someone here says `` alot of indie snobs love deerhoof '' . that 's correct , and that pretty much speaks volumes . here 's another band with hip vintage equipment , boring song structures , alot of connections , and nothing to say . as if there were n't enough of these bands out there . absolutely nothing of consequence is going on here : it basically boils down to a phenomenal waste of human and natural resources to make this band 's cds and release them to their 30 or so fans ( mostly indie rock cd store clerks ) . it is also a waste of your time , and mine , giving them another moment of thought . extra points docked for the worst band name ever
