separation sunday this is not ... .. i enjoyed separation sunday tremendously , an original ( although not for everyone ) album full of hard rocking music and raucous lyrics to match . as a thitrysomething , i found the lyrics on sep. sun . to be a clever look at the party scene and the passage of time , with both the highs and lows of growing out of the mayhem and into adulthood , or reaching your own `` resurrection '' . this new album ( boys and girls ) is much more drab , with less of an in-your-face delivery of fairly lame lines that i would be emarrased to listen to if i were older than 20 . these are juvenile songs which sound aimed at the mtv generation , with cheesy lines and hooks . i had thought this band was the real deal , and had argued as such , but after hearing this it is clear they are a bunch of posers .
