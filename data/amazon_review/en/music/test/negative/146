not what i wanted the title of this cd threw me off ; the description and the first review did n't help either . the primary reason for buying this cd was the song `` you are my sister '' , but this version is a duet with someone that ca n't sing . i ca n't tell which cd has a version of the song as seen on letterman . disappointing
