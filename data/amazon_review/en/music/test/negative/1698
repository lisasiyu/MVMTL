paul weller 's failure ok , do n't get me wrong i 'm a major paul weller fan , since 1977 , but apart from a couple a gems like 'solid bond ' and 'shout to the top ' this is weller at his worst.after the rise and rise of the jam , he tries to go all soulful and funky and misses by a mile.do n't waste your money on this rubbish , go buy the jam boxset and listen to weller at his most powerful and leader of the greatest band ever
