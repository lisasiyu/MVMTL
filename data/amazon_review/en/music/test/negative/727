two star average ... hahaha let 's face it . rap/hip-hop basically killed itself during the turn of the century . with no talent retards like 50 cent , ja rule , nelly , ludacris , lil jon , d4l , and a million others dumbing it down with processed fake lyrics and repetitive beats that drive real music fans crazy . it 's horrid , i tell you . with a bunch of guest appearances by other mainstream hacks and horrible vocabulary , no wonder the society has gone corrupt . hopefully this hack will stop rolling around in the money and get a job at the local gas station . if you want good rap , go for n.w.a. , wu-tang clan , public enemy , and anything the members in those bands have done . for talented music in general , go for between the buried and me , unearth , chimaira , necrophagist , dying fetus , aborted , the black dahlia murder , despised icon , darkest hour , meshuggah , cryptopsy , basically anything that i give good reviews on .
