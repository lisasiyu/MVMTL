this sucks bigtime what the hell is this crapola ? the real misfits were not about lame as* bullsh*t ! like everyone else says , what you usually hear without danzig has lost it 's edge . they lost their edge . what 's the point of making music and calling yourself the misfits when you 're really not changing anything ? punk is about change . change is usually edgy , this is honestly far from that . the misfits changed music - they had their own sound , they were original , and nobody else had that sound . i 'm saying this about alot of other bands . we 're not danzig heads , we 're not kissing as* . the misfits truly lost their edge . we 're not expecting every band to always sound the same - but at least create newer and edgier music because nowadays every band sounds the same . it 's all up to the original bands to influence everybody , and when you 're making music that does n't influence anyone , what 's your point - money ?
