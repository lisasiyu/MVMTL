ethereal and sublime goes ricky martin sorry , i 'm a big fan of the first two d.f . cds . anxiously awaited the third ... bought it without hesitation ... mmm , sadly disappointed . the magic the first two brought to the world is what seemed to set them apart . cosmic , mysterious and almost spooky . so fitting to the groups name , deep forest made me feel sensuously connected to the natural world . comparsa on the other hand , though it must certainly fill the musicians desires to expand their creative global conquest , fans like myself feel abruptly misdirected . harsh , tinny , fast latin rhythems , overwhelm a majority of the otherwise liquid and textural backbeat tracks . i just ca n't seem to kick back and drift away with this latest endeavor . unfortunatly , it reminds me more of a nature company latin sampler ( do n't get me wrong , i love the works of groups such as b-tribe ) . but if you 're expecting more of the same to come out of this beloved duo , get ready for a hard right . perhaps their next albumn will return to a kinder , gentler world
