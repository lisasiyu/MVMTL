gershwin 's playing overated after i heard this cd i bought gershwin plays gershwin on the naxos label which ar n't piano rolls . any pianist can tell that many of these rolls are heavily edited and ca n't be played by a pianists with two hands . on the naxos album that has some of these same songs gershwin 's actual playing does n't sound very good . many of gershwins contempories such as james p. johnson , eubie blake , luckey roberts and even zez confrey were much better pianists than he was , however they did n't have his melodic gifts as a composer . i would recommend artis whodhouse's transcriptions of jelly roll morton 's piano rolls ( on the same label ) instead because most of those are exactly how he played them and in my opinion morton was a better musician in every way than gershwin .
