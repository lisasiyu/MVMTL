big mistake / lost opportunity the point has come that nearly all great recordings have been remastered in some way , shape or form and subsequently re-released . because of that i decided to get an ipod strictly for the purpose of `` collecting '' as many of my favorites as possible . my plan has been to buy most of them from amazon or an amazon seller & then put them on the pod . so much of my favorite music has been re-mastered ( makes me feel old.. maybe cuz i am ! ) that this has become quite a project ! anyway , almost every re-mastered cd i 've picked up has sounded better than the original . some are improved so much that it 's as if the album seems like a brand new release ( psbwb is a phenomenal example ) . anyhow , i did n't realize that cte was remastered and remixed when i bought it . i expected it to be like all the other remasters i 've listened to - a favorite album with much better clarity and a lot more boom . countdown to extinction is a masterpiece as far as i 'm concerned , even though my favorite megadeath album is probably peace sells . countdown was ( when first released ) absolutely perfect - something no other megadeath album had been . dave had recently gotten sober if i recall corectly , and that along with the new guys made this a new sound with much more maturity than before . it was landmark to be sure . did i mention it was perect ? the remix was a horrible mistake in my book . if dave wanted a remix for himself & burned it during the remaster work that would have been fine - but to release the so-called `` remastered '' cte in a completely different form sucks - i feel ripped off . i want the opportunity to own cte in remastered form without anything other than the quality of sound being tweaked . maybe if enough people complain and continue to do so the nagging will eventually lead to such a release . dave should be aware that potential new megadeath fans were won over by the thousands with this album , and it probably continues to do so - but if the average cd of cte floating around on the net or on store shelves 5 years from now is the remaster ( and thus also remixed ) , it will likely not win the new listener over . that 's sad , because cte is megadeath 's `` black '' album - and the remix is a completely different album with completely different songs . it is not a remix or a remaster , it 's a new release . had this remixed version been what was released when cte originally came out , it would n't be worth issuing as a remaster in the first place . i want my cte remaster ! ! ! !
