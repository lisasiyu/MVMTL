tony bennett ... er , eric clapton i only hope this does n't signify the end of his career . any time an artist begins consistently collaborating with `` friends '' , it signals the end of a career . look at santana . the guy ca n't make a solo album anymore . this is what happened to john lee hooker . musically , this albums lacks the care clapton used to give his music . he used to be a careful , calculated musician who knew how to rock . just bear this in mind if you buy the album . you may want to enjoy this cd with a 6-pack of ensure while wearing your favorite pair of depends . and a members only jacket . clapton just does n't know what he wants on this album . blues ? jazz ? easy listening ? ho-down appalachian stomp ? hee haw ? crooner ? eric , make up your mind . then give us a cd worth a listen
