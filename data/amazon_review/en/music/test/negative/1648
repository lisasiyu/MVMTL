not my first choice johnny rotten must have been upset with his record company when he recorded this effort . the production is sloppy and there does n't appear to be any attempts at song construction . it 's simply jah wobble wobbling along while rotten moans and rants unintelligibly . it would n't surprise me if all the tracks were recorded in one take and in one day . blah blah blah pil 's first album is much better
