hahahaha i would n't have such a big problem with rap if they did n't call it music . that 's like calling the teletubbies 'theater ' . a bunch of guys talking to a beat is not music , it 's poetry with a rhythm . and these guys do n't give a f*ck what they are writing about , all they care about is the loot . so f -- - all of these rap artists taking up space on the tv and radio . progressive 4 ever
