overrated group when i first started to get into doo wop , back in the early '70 's , the records of the channels were some of my favorites . i played `` the closer you are '' a zillion times on my stereo . it just had this a particularly striking sound that you could n't put into words . earl lewis ' voice , to me at that time . was unlike nothing i 'd ever heard , and nothing i 'd ever hear again . i was caught up by the beauty of the `` new york sound '' , and loved it . the same was true with many of the other channels records that i got to add to my collection . to me , they were always at the top of my favorites list , or close to it . nothing could dissuade from loving each and every one of their records . until , in 1970 , reality set in . i saw them live at a `` rock and roll revival '' show , at the academy of music theater , in manhattan . they were billed , along with 8 other groups , in a outstanding show . once the channels showed up on stage , one problem became obvious : earl lewis could n't sing to save his life . and these , supposedly , were the best years of his voice . true , he attempted to get through `` the closer you are '' , `` the gleam in your eye '' , `` that 's my desire '' , and several of their other local hits with the group . but every time he did so , it became apparent that the guy had no pitch . he just could n't find the notes . the result was one of the worst listening experiences of my life . `` pain in my heart '' was a pain in my ears . you could say that earl simply had a bad night . i wish that was the case , but every time i saw them on stage , probably six times in all , through the next four years , featured along with a number of other groups in other shows , it was the same story . when the group backed away , and earl lewis had his solo parts to do , he was about as sour and as off-key as a singer could get . ( that 's still the case , even these days . ) and what was remarkable to me was how the auduence , at every show , never noticed . they applauded and cheered , as though everything was just the way it should 've been . how sad . there was more attention placed on the nostalgia of the song , than how well or poorly it was performed . these experiences made me go back to my collecton , and listen to my channels records with some better insight . i began to think that on a few of them , earl lewis simply got lucky on a few takes , and actually found the notes ! the backup group , while adequate ( and also somewhat off-key ) , is n't the greatest ensemble to hear , either . for proof , listen to their disastrous version of `` that 's my desire '' , and compare it to the flamingos ' recording . for better , exquisite singing , check out the harptones , the moonglows , the jive five , the dubs , or anything by the flamingos . in my opnion , as far as the records of the chanels are concerned , the best of the bunch are `` bye bye baby '' and `` my love for you will never die '' . they were a better than average ( on a few of their recordings ) ny group , but hardly worthy of the praise they 're given . and believe me : until i saw them live , i used to be awed by what i thought was incredible talent . not anymore . i hate to burst anybody 's bubble , but it helps to put it all in perspective
