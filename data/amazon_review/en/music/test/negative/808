past his prime long-time waits fan here , with several of his albums being on my all-time favorites list . i owned this album for nearly a year , before i traded it in . it took me a while to figure out why i always wandered out of the room after a few songs and forgot about it -- because it s -- ks . the lyrics either are incoherent , just strung together ( eg get behind mule ) , or veer off into the cringingly sentimental ( eg house where nobody lives , chocolate jesus ) . the music mostly drags , when it 's not downright grating . he 's lost it . you ca n't blame him for not knowing it , i guess . but it 's long past time to write him off -- since bone machine . ( the stage works black rider , alice , and blood money , show a consistent weakness -- a lack of focus lyically as well as musically , not to mention a lot of low fi recording . i had a similar experience where it took me a few years to realized why i kept skipping tracks on black rider -- because it mostly su-ks -- and treaded it . ) he peaked with the island trilogy . my personaly favorite is frank 's wild years . before the far-out sound , he also produced a lot of real poetry along with his jazz-club shtick . now his writing seems almost like senile mumbling . and his thematic concerns hvae descended/ degenerated into the likes of loving family life . is there any chance of a renascence ? ( not as yet based on a sampling of real gone . ) all the kids who have caught onto the waits thing need try to think a lot harder about these songs and compare them to songs on rain dogs and swordfishtrombones . back then even when the references and language were oblique , or obscure , they developed a story or an image or a sentiment . it built from line to line -- developed an idea , with continuity . now it 's mostly a string of stylized cr-p , using the vocabulary he developed all his life but to no end .
