fakey-*fake live album alert* not only is this a bad representation of ac/dc live , ( they only opened up with riff raff during the brief powerage tour and who cares about rock n roll damnation , live anyway ) , but this is a fake live album . judging by many of the alternate live recordings available , ac/dc just never sounded like this live , its all doctored up , the crowd noise is fake ( listen to the `` fweep '' of the tape machine being turned off at the end of `` whole lotta rosie '' , a glaring mistake and proof of the fakiness . not a horrible album , hell aint a bad place and problem child are pretty good , but where is live wire ? rocker was'nt available yet in the usa either which just makes it all the more confusing . proof that bon scott ac/dc album can ... . ps : let there be rock and flick of the switch are the best ac/dc albums..
