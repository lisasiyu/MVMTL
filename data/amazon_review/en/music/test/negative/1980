how about a band has to actually be good to havea hits cd ? how can you even have a hits cd considering they had no decent music or hits to begin with ? i listened to the entire cd and couldnt find a single song worth listening to for more than 8 seconds . this cd is full of horrible songs and now i have to have surgery to stop my ears from bleeding
