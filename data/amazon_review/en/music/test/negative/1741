where did it all go wrong ? considering he was one half of the excellent wham ! great things were expected from mr michael when he went solo . unfortunately the pressure must have got to him as this album is a disaster . fans of classics such as wham rap , bad boys and club tropicana drinks are free will be bitterly disappointed . it seems obvious to me that andrew ridgeley had been carrying mr michael for years
