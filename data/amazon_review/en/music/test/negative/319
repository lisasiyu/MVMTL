inner thoughts from a hollow man . imagine no possessions ? fine , then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces . imagine no religion ? fine , if religion 's such a `` crutch '' , then you forsake your million dollar drug habit . imagine no countries ? fine , then you move from england or america to africa or el salvador . the world will be as one ? fine , then you act like an adult and do n't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most . john lennon was a text book phony . he was a grown-up with a child 's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he would n't . maybe if he did n't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded ... ..then and now . the utopian dreams of the 60 's are history , and they were destroyed by none other than lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation . his blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn . thank you very much . -dw .
