snooze fest i 'm sad to say that suede has hit rock bottom with `` new morning . '' there 's just nothing here that moves me . no edge to the music or lyrics that i expect from this band that was so darn good in the early 90 's and that desperately tried to carry the torch after butler left . brett anderson 's voice sounds pretty good . i just wish they had better songs to show it off . they had mixed success on coming up and head music but this just falls flat imo . if you are planning to sample suede for the first time after reading or hearing about them i would recommend the bernard butler era albums `` suede '' and `` dog man star '' . the double album b-sides `` sci fi lullabie '' is fantastic too and lets you taste great tracks full of promise even after bernard butler split
