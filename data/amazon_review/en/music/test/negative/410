disposable i have good news for the guys in rooney and hot hot heat : you 'll have plenty of free time on your hands these next few months , as seattle 's the lashes have taken the liberty of recording your new albums for you . be sure to send them a thank-you card from the beach . i 'm only half-joking . get it , the lashes ' full-length debut , sounds exactly like the aforementioned bands . ( maybe instead of thank-you notes , those bands should be sending cease-and-desist letters . ) and while plenty of bands sound like plenty of other bands -- hell , a good chunk of cd reviewing is merely pointing that out -- what 's most distressing is that , as a result , the lashes have no personality of their own . one minor aside : a buddy of mine teased me earlier this summer during a trip to the beach when i popped in rooney 's self-titled debut for a little driving music . `` what is this ? inoffensive pop rock mix # 1 ? '' he cracked . my friend has a point , and it extends to the lashes : the music cranked out by these acts is sunny , hooky and instantly disposable pop that works best when used as , well , driving music en route to the beach . granted , this is not a crime , but it 's hard to get too eager about such ephemeral music . every track on get it -- with the exception of the mid-tempo , string-section aided `` dear hollywood '' -- is upbeat and interchangeable-with-every-other-track-on-the-disc power pop , from the jangly single `` sometimes the sun '' , the new wavy flourishes of `` the world needs more love letters '' , and the bouncy keyboards of `` nate 's song '' . trying to differentiate between these songs is like trying to pinpoint the differences between brands of toothbrushes -- they all do about the same thing , with very little variation . i mentioned that there are no actual crimes against music on get it , but the lashes are guilty of playing it too safe .
