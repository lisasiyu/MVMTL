another band that sounds the same as all the others ( sucks ) well the band sounds like a yellow card , simple plan , panic at the disco , all american rejects etc . all of the bands have the same sound and music that a person from 10-17 would buy . and you proboly saw the video before hearing the song on the radio . if your older 18 and up . you need to get in to some good music . try the ramones , the offspring , sex pistols or even green day .
