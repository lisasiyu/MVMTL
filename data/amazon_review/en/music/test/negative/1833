a handel don't my initial reaction on hearing this recording was to deaccession it at once . on better thought , i decided to hold onto it as a striking example of how not to sing the music of handel . nothing works here : the garbled coloratura , the inept dynamics , the cardboard emotions , the lack of arc . the performances convey no hint of sensitivity . ms. fleming 's warm voice has been much better deployed in other repertory , like strauss . but this wo n't do . perhaps more distressing than the singing itself is the rabid loyalty of the flemingites , who obviously consider this singer to be the second coming of callas . this is a discredit to the singer herself , who has remarkable talent and poise and has no need of mindless fans to protect her from her mistakes . to the fledgling singers who admire this recording so much , i would urge a broader scope . a future of handelian singing in this mold is a very discouraging prospect indeed
