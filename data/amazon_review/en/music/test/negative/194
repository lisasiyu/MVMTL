an ozzy osbourne rippoff , do n't buy have u heard `` let 's go '' from from this poser who thinks nobody has ever heard crazy train from ozzy osbourne ? he completely killed a really cool part of that song and replaced a really hardcore song with somthing dumb like `` let 's go ! ! ! ! ! '' and other dumb rhymes . i never understood why rap did this . think of me as white heavy metal trash if u want but at least heavy metal people play guitar and rappers use mics and rap about things nobody cares about . heavy metal people are experienced with their fingers while rappers like trick daddy use their palms ( think about that for a minute ) now if u like trick daddy i have no problem with that . i would also have no problem if they did a cover for crazy train from ozzy but i get pissed if they start ripping off giutar riffs from him . i 'm more of a heavy metal type of guy but i like some rap . listen to eminem , ludicris , or lil'john if u wan na hear some rap with original ideas
