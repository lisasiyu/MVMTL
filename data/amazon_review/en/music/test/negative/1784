great music & amp ; performances , disappointing cd i must agree with the previous reviewer , who found this cd 'lacking in grandeur ' . the vocal performances and music are meticulously crafted and delivered , and may indeed be true to the spirit of the period in which they were written . but they are curiously lightweight , and i felt like i was listening to musical fluff . & quot ; jesu joy of man 's desiring & quot ; -- in my opinion , the most moving of all the cantatas -- was far too fast-paced : it sounded distressingly like the minute waltz . & quot ; sleepers awake & quot ; received similar treatment . professionally , all of the performers on this cd undoubtedly delivered , but what they delivered was curiously lacking in the soul-stirring majesty that bach 's cantatas can evoke
