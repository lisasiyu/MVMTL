puts the dead back in dead prez this is typical political hip hop . rants , slander , and completely moronic and asinine conspiracy theories . all accompanied by weak beats , bad lyrics , and terrible performances by m ( oron ) -1 . this political rap garbage needs to die out and it makes me happy to know this junk flopped . save your money and buy ghostface 's new album . this will be surely headed to my list of the year 's worst albums . big big big big thumbs down
