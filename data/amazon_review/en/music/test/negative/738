could have been so much better what a shame that gems such as longfellow serenade , signs , lady-oh and both sides now were left off this release in exchange for several low quality live recordings that do appear . given mr. diamond 's long and illustrious career , this release disappoints . again , what a shame . so much potential and so little fulfillment
