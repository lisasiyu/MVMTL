yet another mis-titled `` very best of '' album yet another attempt to re-write history and ignore the pre-rumours era of the band . to truly be called the very best of fleetwood mac , you would have to include at least , black magic woman , oh well , sentimental lady and hypnotized . there are many more quintessential songs from the pre-buckingham/nicks era that should be included , but those four were in heavy fm rotation in the early 70 's . they exposed the band to a huge audience , which made their commercial breakthrough in 1975 possible . to exclude them and then title this release a `` best of '' is criminal
