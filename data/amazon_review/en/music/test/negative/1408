misinterpretations ! i was shocked to see that maurice white had a hand in this misinterpretations of earth wind and fire 's classic songs . this cd was to launch or re-launch the stax label . its too bad the label did not launch with more orginal artists and compositions . while you may like the arrangements of the elements ' compositions , i could not get through this effort . the originals suit me just fine .
