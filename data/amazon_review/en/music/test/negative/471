please make it stop ! ! i read recently that sheryl crow 's song `` good is good '' a song from her new album , was nominated for a grammy award . seriously , how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that . tnmc , also won a grammy when it was released . i still can not understand why , but i do have a theory . simply put , the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity . while only a mediocre talent at best , sheryl crow is deified . i realize that this is only my opinion ( and i have a right to state it ) this type of music nauseates me . there is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated . do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek . i do have a solution : all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned `` crimes '' should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some `` soul . '' peace
