one of the few slayer albums that you can skip . live undead is n't a must have to be in your collection of slayer albums . this record only provides evidence of the greedy metal blade record label . some people say that they threw in an audience sample afterwards to create a fake live album . well it is and it is n't . this is n't a concert , but it 's a real audience . this is slayer simply rehearsing 7 of their songs from show no mercy and haunting the chapel and they brought about 20 or more fans into the studio or whatever to hear them play . on the plus side , several of these songs are played better than the originals , however the production is terrible . a possible reason for this is that brian slagel and metal blade released this without permission from slayer , at the time they knew nothing about it . what is here is early slayer , just beginning to develop their true sound , but it 's only 23 minutes in length and metal blade is asking 17 dollars for it ? but as fellow reviewer fu2 put it , here 's what they should have done , take all four metal blade releases , remaster them , maybe add some bonus tracks and release them as 2 discs with maybe show no mercy/haunting the chapel and hell awaits/live undead or something similar . but here is the real kicker about this record that is my biggest complaint . on most early versions ( vinyl and first cd release and some imports ) there is a redone version of chemical warfare as a untitled track with better quality than the original that can no longer be found on this release . why ? i have no idea . if you are planning to get this , chances are you are a fanatic , and personally , this is the only slayer release that i have yet to see in a cd store . i recommend finding this off ebay , and maybe the vinyl version as that is a picture disc and is a really cool thing to look at and features the picture on the back of the case with the band playing but with a hole in tom 's face for the record player . i give this two stars because this is n't worth the price that they are asking for . this is listenable but there are plenty of other bootlegs out there with more songs if that is what you are looking for , because that is exactly what this is . metal blade 's cash in on slayer because as i stated before , slayer knew nothing about this until it was released . i could n't possibly give anything from slayer a one star because that just does n't seem possible , as the talent is present , but this thing just does n't have very good sound and is n't worth the price and once again , only for fanatics . hoped this helped . interesting fact : that after this was released ; the band called the undead released a live album called live slayer
