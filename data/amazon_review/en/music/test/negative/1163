what in the world happened ? when i first heard that 4 strings would be coming out with another album i was excited . i had so thoroughly enjoyed their first cd that i had high hopes for this one . the first single was amazing ! the day it came out i ran out and bought it . i must have listened to it hundreds of times , it was so good ! i could n't wait for the actual album . then it came out ... my excitement diminished . first of all , i realized that vanessa was barely on the cd . you do n't mess with a good thing ! vanessa 's voice complimented the music so well ! then a second problem arose : the music seemed like a rehash of the previous album 's music only this time with different lyrics . what happened ? ! the only relief i found in this cd was the track `` euphoric eyes . '' it 's the only track that does n't make me want my money back . ( even both versions of the title track `` turn it around '' make me angry . i advise getting the single , as it has the best version . ) so here 's my verdict : major disappointment . why , 4 strings ? why
