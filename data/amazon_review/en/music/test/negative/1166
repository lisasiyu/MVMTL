disappointed - use original i must say i am rather disappointed ... however i am not the `` target market '' . the problem is it is basically the same as original , only played using keyboards and instead of voice you get another track of keyboard . all the songs are `` lullabys '' itself as written originally by smith & co . therefore my suggestion is get your cd burner and create your compilation for the baby from original cds . it will do the same job and you will have more fun : ) ..as the songs get slightly boring played with keyboard and without the lyrics ; ) my son ( slightly & lt ; 2yrs ) already knows the original songs , of course -lol- , and he does not seem to relate to this more than original . he likes moby most of all : d ok , that is my 2c . p p.s . the same is true for radiohead and nirvana that i bought as well . p.p.s . i bought many of these for my friends babies and ( some ) like it a lot.. so ymm
