hideous arrangments ! ! ! - stay clear . 1 of dylan 's worst ! ! ! i 'm a huge dylan fan - and collector ( i have around 120 or so of his albums , bootlegs , shows etc. ) . this is one of his worst ever - if not the worst - the only redeeming feature - the singing is not bad - even good on afew tracks . docendo discimus is dead right - spot on criticism - i could/t have said it better myself - so i wo n't try . anyone , imh , who gives this album more than 3 stars is of his rocker..
