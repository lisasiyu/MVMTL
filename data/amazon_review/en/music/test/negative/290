not as great as said by most yeah i read the reviews on how great this album is . dont get me wrong its unique but that doesnt mean im gon na feel it . im sure some underground head is gon na read this and trip and write a review dissin me . so let me tell you there is just as much fake ass artists in the underground as mainstream . so dont discriminate mainstream and underground . give mainstream a chance . you might like it . i dont even talk about whats what anymore . i like outkast , the game , and some g unit that doesnt make me a `` a non true hip hop head '' . oh yeah back to the album . i really didnt like it cuz it was borin and left me thinking about other things . im mad that i bought this cd . i will give him a 2 star for effort though . heed my words majority kids
