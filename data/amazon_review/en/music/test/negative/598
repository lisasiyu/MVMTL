shhh , do n't tell anyone but miles gives me a headache shhh , do n't tell anyone but miles and his `` in your face '' trumpet give me a headache . i like funk and groove so i should have done a bit more homework before trying out the jazz scene . for me this cd is mostly silent except for some irritating trumpet blowing like foxtail into your eardrums . i was about to give up on the whole jazz scene when i came upon panthalassa . track 1 of that cd ( in a silent way/shhh/peaceful ) is nice ; smoothing out and grooving out miles while staying true : say the purists . if you love it remixed and electrofied ( yes sir ! ) check out dj cam 's tribute to `` in a silent way '' .
