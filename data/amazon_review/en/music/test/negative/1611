a terrible waste of money i bought this album thinking it would be good , because every review i read gave it 5 stars . so i thought `` why not ? '' and bought it . i put it in the cd player , and was immediately dissapointed . the first thing i noticed was how terrible the sound levels were . it sounds like it was recorded in my garage , everything is way over-saturated and the drums are mic 'd terribly . you ca n't even tell what 's going on half the time , which is n't saying much , because there is nothing very interesting happening in the guitars . so i listened a little longer , thinking `` it has to get better , maybe they 'll add some symphonic stuff or something , considering this was reviewed to be some sort of black metal masterpiece . '' i was wrong of course , as the first track remained pretty stagnant , as did the next , and the next track etc . assumed that the frontman must be a good singer , considering his howl is absolutely laughable . once again , bad sound levels come in to play here , even though not a whole lot could cover up how terrible this dude is . basically this album is not the black metal masterpiece it was hyped up to be . if you are into really bad prog metal with bad production , this album is for you . if you 're not , steer clear of this album . it was the biggest waste of money i made this year
