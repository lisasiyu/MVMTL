lights back on i loved lights out 1 and 2 , but 3 was a huge disappointment , even after a few listens . disc 1 begins with a robotechno caucophony that 's just straight up weird , painful to listen to , and runs far too long . the rest of disc 1 gets better , but it still left me waiting for some climactic crescendos or wild mixing twists . cd2 begins with an equally banal sound , and does n't get interesting until about halfway through . ( in fact , the last half of cd2 is the only part of this set that i ever listen to at all anymore . ) overall , the song choice is pretty blah , and even the mixing seems a bit sloppy and uninspired . it 's definitely got lawler 's dark and nasty fingerprints throughout , but it sounds a bit canned , and definitely does n't meet the standard set by 1 and 2
