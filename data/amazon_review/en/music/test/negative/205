and then he composed himself ... let me start off by saying that after extensive therapy , i feel that i 'm finally able to write this review . i 've been reading some of the other comments on this board and all i can say is that i 've never been an advocate of hindering people 's right to free speech ... until now . i just got finished listening to jeffery gaines 's version of in your eyes and i have two burning questions that just wo n't go away . first of all , where is it that the other contributors to this board buy their smoke ? and secondly , why did n't mr. gaines just cover peter gabriel in gasoline , strike a match , and call it even ? on the other hand , i must agree with a few of these people on one point : this version of in your eyes evokes emotions in me i never thought i had the capacity to realize . i honestly ca n't say i blame anyone who finds their eyes welling up with tears when confronted with this towering monument to mediocrity -- i had the same experience myself . and as for those wisened souls who feel this version has some measure of value and , in fact , & quot ; blows peter gabriel 's version out of the water , & quot ; here 's a thought for you to tax your proton-sized brains over : a nuclear bomb can blow many things out of the water , but that does n't make it a good thing to inflict on innocent people . but if , after considering this , you still arrive at your original conclusion , there 's only one course of action i can self-respectingly recommend . take your own life . do it now before it 's too late
