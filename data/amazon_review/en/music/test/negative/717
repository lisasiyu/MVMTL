2 and a half stars `` howl '' comes so close to being good . they capture a real authentic `` backporch '' sound , with great production . the lyrics are passable , the singing is n't too obnoxiously affected . but there just are n't any good songs on here . it 's like when you meet someone who dresses well , seems to share some common interests , and can make small talk like a champ . but then when you finally try to have a substantial conversation you realize they are thoroughly uninteresting , and just sort of suck all around . well , it 's the musical equivalent of that . they set a great vibe for beer drinking , sitting on the porch , etc . just like a tape of whales calling to each other really gives you that authentic ocean feel . but nice as they sound , whales do n't write good music and niether do the black rebel motorcycle club . alot of people see music 's primary function as providing a nice background . i 'm sure they 'll be pretty happy with this cd . also , a lot of people are lifeless zombies with no souls .
