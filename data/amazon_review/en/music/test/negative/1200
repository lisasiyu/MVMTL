1 star for remastered - 5 stars for original who remastered it ? it sure was n't bob ; find the unremastered cd if you can . or better yet , - the original lp is absolutely amazing . this remastered version is a record company trying to tell you it is `` new and improved '' when it is neither . for the best experience in appreciating bob marley and what he accomplished , read a biography , then listen to all the original albums . here are some of my favorite bob marley songs that are not usually on any best list : heathen , small axe , who the cap fit , war , get up stand up , johnny was , duppy conqueror , cry to me , one foundation . if i was forced to pick his best song it would probably be `` war . '' even though he did n't write the words and it is largely spoken , it is extremely powerful
