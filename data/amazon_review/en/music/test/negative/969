a lukewarm effort for the boys from the jungle ... close but no cigar beneath the remains , sepultura 's 3rd album from 1989 this album , along with chaos a.d. and arise , is considered to be the embodiment of sepultura 's classic era , and many fans consider this to be one of the finest , if not the finest installment in the band 's catalog . with that said , this disc offers straight ahead thrash metal and little else . there are a lot of great riffs , great solos , and a lot of time changes , which will be enough to whet the appetite of many metal fans . be that as it may , though , you should be warned that the boys really did not make an inspired effort on this record . it 's basically just a slash and shred metal record with very little creativity or personality . an album like this really ca n't stack up against some of the greatest creative works of the genre , such as metallica 's ... and justice for all , iron maiden 's powerslave , or megadeth 's rust in peace . i would give a track-by-track evaluation , but nothing really stands out here . i also have a gripe with max cavalera 's vocals . i was really not pleased with what i heard from him , as his vocal style was not very well developed at this point in his career . andreas kisser and cavalera sound pretty good on guitar . the standout track would probably be `` slaves of pain . '' there 's a great little bit around the two minute mark where cavalera sings , `` open your eyes / do n't lose your steps / liberty is a dream / and it also is real , '' then it slides into a spine chilling riff and a great solo . drummer igor cavalera also turns in a pretty decent performance . this disc has something to offer , but what i 've come to find is that there are some albums that really captivate you and there are some albums that you just ca n't get into no matter what you do . unfortunately , beneath the remains fell into the latter category for me .
