fluffy pretentiousness hellogoodbye has a sound that 's really in vogue right now . the problem is they forgot that no amount of 'being hip ' can replace 'tired cliche writing ' . in many regards - most of the songs on the album could have been sung by a female pop group in the 90s and it would have sounded perfectly in place ( especially touchdown turnaround ( do n't give up on me ) which is borderline annoying ) . the band also needs to adopt a more singular sound . the point is an album is supposed to be cohesive , and the swtich from more traditional instrumentations to songs and a purely synth base instrumentation makes the alubm sound like two bands fighting for the attention of the listeners . in many ways , it 's almost as if the band wanted to be both phases of the band depeche mode at once . in case you do n't listen to depeche mode , their early releases were very light and poppy and purely synth base , such as the song `` just ca n't get enough . '' however , at some point ( i usually point it around the single blasphemous rumours ) , the band became much more darker and eventually became a more traditional rock band in the sense that their albums were dominated by guitars . then they went back to synths while keeping the darker sound . the problem is that the band accomplishes neither very well , and even if they did , the two sounds do n't together at once . then comes the lyrics . their songwriter employs cliches and shows that he understands the basics of how to rhyme . for instance , `` everywhere and everytime/ i am yours and you are mine '' from touchdown turnaround . the other lyrics are just as simplistic - just like `` i like where we are/ when we drive in your car '' from here ( in your arms ) . the author does n't know how to express love in a manner that does n't come off as very niave and simplistic , as if stating the obvious makes for great song lyrics . they are not terrible . they just simply are nothing special . it just sounds as if they are taking the hip sound and forgetting what made that sound was hip was quality song writing . and they just do n't bring that to the table . the only thing they bring to the table are two guilty pleasures ... sadly touchdown turnaround and here . if the songwriter can get a bit deeper with his lyrics and the band chooses a sound they could put out a nice piece of pop fluff . as it stands , this album is nothing but fluffy pretentiousness . remember rule # 1 of music - it should never sound like you are trying . it should just sound natural . and it sounds like these guys tried hard
