if you 're a fan of the band , skip it i bought this cd for a few bucks a while ago at a christian music store . the next day i brought it back . i expected it to be different , but i did n't expect it to be horrible . this is early '90s rap . we 're talking really bad here . like , vanilla ice/ninja rap-bad . they had to start somewhere , but if you want my advice , skip this and go to the good stuff - supernatural , jesus freak , etc
