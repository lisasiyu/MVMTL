is my stereo broken ? first of all , let me qualify this review by stating up front that i have been a dm fan since its inception and think that the band has single-handedly influenced a whole generation of musicians . that being said , i think this album is a symptom of a much larger problem with the band : a real lack of vision and originality . on the good side , many dm diehard fans will like the majority of the tracks because it reverts to familiar fodder - dark lyrics with machine-driven rhythms . on the bad side , it 's all too familiar stuff with beats that could have been lifted from earlier efforts . the only real difference is that the tracks on `` angel '' sound like they 've been fed through a fuzz-box . the first time i listened to this disc , i thought i had blown-out the speakers because the drum tracks clipped and everything else sounded distorted and fuzzy . i soon realized this was intentional , but had to ask myself , why ? `` exciter '' was experimental , but a truly drained effort . this album sounds like a pale imitation of bjork . they even copied the toy piano and music box stuff like on bjork 's `` vespertine '' album . the difference between bjork and dm is that bjork knows how to use weird sounds to enhance a lyric and create a musical mood . this album just sounds like conventional mid 80 's dm music that was fed through badly recorded effects . i really could feel the creative slide with this band when `` ultra '' was released , but this record confirms what i have sensed for some time . the band has really struggled to achieve artistic relevency since the departure of alan wilder . martin gore is a musical genius , but he has limitations when carrying 90 % of the musical vision and writing . i really think gore needs an intellectual foil to conterpoint and challenge his ideas . unfortunately , this album sounds more like a gore solo effort than a true dm product and as a result , the music has greatly suffered . gone are the famously catchy hooks and relevant , edgy lyrics . here comes the gloomy ballads with headcase-jilted-lover lyrics ( yawn ) . a new member or creative colaborator in the band would inject some fresh ideas into their music or i fear this may be their last record . word of advise : although this album does show some promise at times , your best friend here is itunes . download `` precious '' and preview the rest of the record before making any additional choices . you may find it very hard to find another tune worthy of keeping on your ipod
