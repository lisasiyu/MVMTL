useful info in buying karaoke cd's i host a karaoke show in nashville . i have never bought disney karaoke cd 's . however , i will offer you one tip . a lot of people are mislead by & quot ; karaoke cd & quot ; . always read on the disc and make sure it says cd+g on it . i bought some chartbuster karaoke cd 's that were on clearance for 2.99 each . i thought i had a deal . it was just that-a cd and not a cd+g ( compact disc + graphics ) . fortunatly , they took them back and refunded my money . karaoke cd 's are usually just background music
