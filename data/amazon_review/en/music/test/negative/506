just buy the good songs off of itunes first off , i 'm into all the emo/screamo/alternative stuff . the used , senses fail , underoath , all of it . but this cd just does n't cut it . it 's not that it 's bad , the songs just arent that interesting . many of the songs just seem to have the same part it . the singer holding a note with the drummer riding on the double-bass pedal with mindless gutiar . of course tha 's nto teh hole song . but each song seems to have that part in it . there a few good songs , like secrets do n't make friends , and a few others . but it 's not worth getting the whole cd . just buy the good ones off of itunes
