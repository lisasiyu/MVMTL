i wanted to listen to music -- now i have to reinstall windows i 'm tremendously dissapointed by this product . i ca n't express in words how angry i am at having to spend 6 hours repairing my computer after the cd installed a backdoor on to my that allow sony to access any file on my computer . its infuriating how the goverment has allowed sony/bmg to do this to us . if a person has hacked millions of computers and installed software that allowed access to the entire harddrive , that person would be in prison . sony /bmg did this to us and they get away with a slap on the wrist . despite the harm that this cd has done to me , i 'm keeping it . it will be a symbol that i will use remind myself how our corrupt goverment is controlled by corporate interests -- and the harm that these corporations cause to increase their profits
