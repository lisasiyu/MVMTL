tanning with your eyes open wide ! this album is incredibly ambient with lots of electronic sounds floating , and breathy voices echoing in and out of the stratosphere . pacific is simple in its structure ; and for the most part is listenable . at timed it tries to do way too much of the underwater country and emo blend for the eardrums , but their down-tempo jinglebell opiate trip is a recommendation if you like slower music that 's stuck between trying to impress the scenesters and rehashing acoustic grunge . overall i 'd say this album would be perfect for a midnight mescaline trip on a west-coast beach , or some other equally applicable deviation . the group includes lucas jensen , clay , and howard hudson , and is currently playing shows to support the release . visit their website and show the band some support at http : //www.thewarmsupercomputer.com . content copyright www.maximumink.co
