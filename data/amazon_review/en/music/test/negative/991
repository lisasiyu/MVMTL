que hicistes j-lo ? ? ca n't sing , can barely sing or speak spanish and ca n't dance like shakira ... j-lo loves the camera and `` thinks '' she 's it . omg when is this nonsense going to stop ? her `` fans '' buy this music so this woman `` believes '' she can sing . she is simply trying to be `` selena '' but is n't worthy even a glitter of selena 's gold ... you should be ashamed of yourself trying to copy someone so famous , so talented , and now deceased ! ! and , please , j-lo stop `` trying to laugh like selena . '' selena 's laughter was true and full of life and yours is the contrary . woman , you simply have no talent . ben affleck must laugh at your outlandishness at how hard you 're trying to portray that you and marc are `` happily married '' and dayanara torres must thank her lucky stars that you took away the buffoon of her husband who is now your sidekick . get it girl , your songs are annoying and irritating and it 's obvious in this album you 're also trying to sing/sound like marc anthony ... stop ! you obviously have no style that 's why you keep trying to copy others and would n't be surprised if you 'll be trying to copy shakira 's moves ! ! please no more pretend music and recording studio exec ... que hicistes ? ? even the album 's title is awkward !
