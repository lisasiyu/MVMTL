uccchhh , they called these three & quot ; the talented ones & quot ; ! i ask that because the male lead singer of one of the '80 's best contributers to the synth-pop genre , human league , said that on the audio liner notes portion of their & quot ; very best of & quot ; album . the three former members of this group left in the early '80 's and formed their own music group , being heaven 17 . i 'm sorry to say that , having listened to this album one night this past week , i find the cd 's entire song selection , in my opinion , to leave a whole lot to be desired . i do n't even remember any of the titles , and i ca n't understand how any of these purely mediocre tunes ever could have been a hit in any country . that is essentially it for me , the reason i did n't give this album only one star is that , thankfully , it 's not the absolute worst i 've ever heard . i do n't think that my taste in music could possibly be that bad , i 've got taste , decency , dignity , integrity , and a reputation to uphold after all
