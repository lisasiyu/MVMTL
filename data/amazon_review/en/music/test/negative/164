i think he needs a pad and a pen . as another person mentioned , i am no where near a bow bow hater . i remember feeling some type of way about liking him when he was younger because i seldom dig commercial rap . so now he 's all grown up and doing his thing . he had a couple of hits . one day i 'm online reading about this guy hating on will smith and i later learned that this guy does n't even write his own music . what ? ! are you kidding me . no matter who the remarks was to , one can not disrespect another rapper when they do n't even write their own music . after hearing that i was just done . how can you rate his music when he is not writing it ? what are we rating his sound over the music because he has no connection with it . i think it was just ok. `` fresh as i am '' was hot . i was really feeling that sound . i like ok , he 's all grown up and showing people what he is made up but again later i learned he did n't write it ... .lol..that'f funny . is this how jermain dupri feels ? can the real rapper please stand up
