sonic youth loses their way i remember when this album came out . i had been a huge sonic youth fan for years and i ran to mod lang in berkeley to buy it the day it was released . i brought it home , put it on , and desperately tried to like it . but i just could n't . sy had always had a penchant for strectching out their feedback experiments into sprawling , fasinating compositions , but here it all just seemed to melt down into a pointless noise crusade . there are a few high points , but mostly i just find myself thinking , `` there is no way this song deserves to be nine minutes long . '' the slide continued on the next record , but fortunately they got it together again on `` murry street '' and have been putting out great stuff ever since .
