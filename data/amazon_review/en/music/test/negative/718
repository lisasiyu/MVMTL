wrong cd i had ordered this cd for my husband.he likes the movie `` the longest yard '' and he wanted to get the soundtrack of the movie . unfortunately at the time of ordering it did not specify what songs were included in the cd , but i thought if it was from the longest yard movie , then it would be the soundtrack.well , i received the package and gave it to my husband for him to open , he started playing it and was very disappointed.he ended up getting a cd full of stupid rap songs . i am not happy with what i received , if i could send it back and get something else i would , but i know it will be a hassle to even ask for an exchange.my suggestion to other people is to find out exactly what they 're lookin for before placing an order and just because the cover looks like the original , it does not mean it 's what you 're really looking for . i only spent $ 12.00 which is a good thing , but it could have lost a lot more . thank you
