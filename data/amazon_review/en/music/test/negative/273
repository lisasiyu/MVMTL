over engineered fluff bebe and cece demonstrate great comprimise in this sad collection of & quot ; gospel & quot ; songs because almost every cut can also be interpreted as a secular love song . unlike a true gospel artist like vickie winans , who has the ability to evangalize through her music , these performers seem to be embarrassed about being inspirational . this disc is for the bubble gum christian , not for the listener who takes his or her faith seriously
