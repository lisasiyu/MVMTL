way overrated out of this whole cd , i could only pick about 3 songs that i liked . this cd is very disappointing and some of the songs were down right annoying . the best songs on here are everything part i , ii/ bow before the king and victory . past those songs , there is not much because i ca n't bear to listen to the rest . those two songs get 1 star each
