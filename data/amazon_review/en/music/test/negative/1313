scary i saw this movie 'cause i was interested to see cathy rigby , & quot ; who was born to play peter pan & quot ; . i hated it a lot . so , now i am in a high school production of peter pan , and i happend to see the mary martin version , and the mary martain cd . i loved it ! then i realized that 'peter pan ' is not a bad musical at all . cathy rigby and the & quot ; crew & quot ; were making it bad . i have no idea why they think cathy rigby is the greatest thing since sliced bread . do n't believe them . she is n't . she sounded like she was a stuiped little brat that just wanted to rot the rest of his [ her ] time just sitting in a dark corner carving forks while on the other hand , mary martain sounds all cheerful , fun , and real . i reccomend mary martain 's video and cd . i say no more
