major let down i really enjoyed the first two books albums , i bought thought for food almost immediately after the lemon of pink because i enjoyed it so much . i found their sound to be quite original with an interesting balance of emotion and humor along with the balance between electronic and acoustic music . so i was really disappointed when i heard their new album . this record is clearly intended to be their breakthrough , with far more vocals and regular song structure and less expirementalism . the record even reuses some samples from old albums which was really annoying . this album lacks the interesting , unexpected twists from their previous works , and as a result comes off as generally bland and sometimes even cheesy . if you want a books album , please check out the other two first
