the most loathsome song ever . i do n't listen to the radio much . in fact , it would be closer to the truth to say that i actively avoid listening to the radio , whenever possible . but it seems that no matter where i go , i ca n't escape the constant airplay of green day 's megahit `` boulevard of broken dreams . '' i do n't hate this song because it has a bland , repetitive structure , or because of the band 's lackluster musical talents , or billie joe 's grating vocals . those are all valid reasons to hate `` boulevard of broken dreams '' but my reason is my own : the lyrical content . let 's take a look , shall we ? `` i walk a lonely road the only one that i have ever known '' yeah , sure , whatever you say . not only does billie joe have a wife of nearly twelve years , he also has numerous friends and millions of adoring fans throughout the world and was voted `` sexiest rock star '' by kerrang ! , and suddenly he 's telling me how lonely he is ? he 's probably never experienced one moment of true loneliness in his whole life ! what kind of hypocrisy is this ? the whole song is nothing but billie joe whining about how he walks alone and how he wishes `` someone out there will find me '' which comes out painfully contrived and insincere . `` oh , you 're overreacting , '' you say . well , maybe i am . but the truth is , i am violently sick of bands churning out shallow , meaningless drivel with some mopey lyrics to try to make money off of people 's misery ; and it 's not just green day , either . bands like linkin park , evanescence , good charlotte , simple plan , and many others all seem to be hooked on trying to parlay their so-called `` loneliness '' into their albums not because they really feel such emotions and wish to honestly express them , but because it sells albums . misery is n't trendy . songs like this and countless others aim for your pocketbook by pretending to `` feel your pain . '' these hacks are n't worth a dime
