dumb franchize boyz dem franchize boyz drifted around the atl music scene and dropped a number of independent releases , but then their song `` white tee '' , while not necessarily becoming a major hit by billboard standards , did give them some brief attention . but that 's nothing compared to the popularity they 've received thanks to their latest album , on top of our game . i personally do n't see what the big deal is about this album . before i listened to it , i thought i would be annoyed by all the snap music , but it turns out that the problem is n't necessarily the music itself , but the below-average lyrics that all four members of dem franchize boyz put on wax . i never was that impressed by `` i think they like me '' ( an obvious single because it 's censored ) , but the thing is , that 's actually the best song on the album . many of the songs feature all-too-familiar subject matter , like cars ( `` ridin ' rims '' ) , bling-blingin ' ( `` you know what it is '' ) , and hardcore sex ( `` freaky as she wan na be '' -- and why does trey songz keep wasting his talent like this ? ) . the choruses can get a little uncreative too : `` do n't play with me '' has `` b , do n't play with me '' while `` stop callin ' me '' has `` b , stop callin ' me '' ( by the way , calling the latter song wack would be an understatement ) . and `` they do n't like that '' makes me wonder if they were reading our minds . the production also tends to get repetitive ; when i heard `` suckas come and try me '' , i felt like singing : `` i think i think they like me ! '' and the remix of `` white tee '' is unnecessary , especially because they mention their white tees in just about every song on here . i 'm also starting to think my brother was right when he suggested that d4l and dem franchize boyz are the same group . the only thing more annoying than the group 's rapping is when damon dash shows up on `` bricks 4 the high '' . no , he is n't rapping ; he 's instead talking -- no , not talking ; whining about severed ties with jay-z and roc-a-fella ( *sigh* ... is he still talking about that ? ) . in the end , while i would n't call this the worst so so def album ever ( young , fly & flashy vol . 1 gets that honor ) , it 's pretty darn close . if this is dem franchize boyz at the top of their game , what does rock bottom look like ? anthony ruper
