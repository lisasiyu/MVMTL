retire please i used to like rob zombie , up until hellbilly delux . everything after that is garbage . this album is no exception . every song sounds the same and is very predictable . the lyrics are nonsensical , educated horses ? he says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this cd , i think he is running out of material and throwing crappy cd 's together to scrap in some extra money . he needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented . i do n't recommend this cd to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his cd's/merchandise regardless . 1 star , i went through this cd in less than 10 minutes , very disappointed , and will never put it back into a cd-player again
