( 2.5 stars ) not missing much with this cd wu-tang clan has seen better times . i remember a day when you could n't help but love everything wu put out either as a group or individually . remember the good ole days of enter the wu-tang , liquid swords , tical , only built for cuban linx , and ironman ? now years later , the outlook for any kind of renaissance is very slim . do n't get me wrong , ghostface killah laid it down with his latest album fishscale . but clifford smith a.k.a . method man is a totally different story . 4:21 ... the day after continues the slippery slope that his solo career has been traveling . there are a few cuts that you might get into like the charismatic `` is it me '' or the posthumous verse of odb on `` dirty mef . '' you can even accept songs such as the lauryn hill assisted `` say , '' the erick sermon produced `` got ta have it , '' or even `` let 's ride '' featuring ginuwine as being decent . one thing that 's become obvious is the fact that he ca n't hold it down alone like he did with tical . but a bunch of these tracks are missing the entertainment quality that we 've become accustom with from method man . i mean , `` somebody done f*cked up '' has some energy , but the beat is too repetitive and never switches up once . the majority of 4:21 ... the day after is brought down by perplexing production and mudane vocals from both method and his guest artists . streetlife brings his wackness to songs like `` 4:20 '' and `` everything '' ( the latter also features an uninspiring verse from inspectah deck . ) and you would think putting method , rza , and raekwon on a track would be a banger , but `` presidential m.c . '' comes and goes without much fanfare . other weak selections include `` konichiwa b*tches , '' `` 4ever '' featuring megan rochell , and `` fall out . '' i honestly ca n't see anybody rushing out to get 4:21 ... .the day after except to complete their method man collection . this album wo n't get much pub from def jam and it seems method man is going through the motions at this day in his career . everyone had high hopes for method man 's career ... but it seems like the only high he 'll be getting is with a blunt .
