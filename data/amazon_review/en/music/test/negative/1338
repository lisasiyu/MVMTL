very good musicians , but this leaves me cold let me preface this by saying i am a big fan of traditional irish music , and a huge fan of dervish , trian , liz carroll , bothy band , kevin burke , andy irvine , etc . this is the first solas cd i have bought , and will probably be the last . although generally very competently played , the music just does n't speak to me . i agree with the some of the other reviews to that effect that this solas recording is too highly orchestrated , and not very traditional ( though i do n't mind that , per se ) . in my opinion & quot ; last of the great whales & quot ; has some of the lamest and simple-minded lyrics i 've ever heard . though she has a very pleasing voice , ms. scanlon 's rendition of it just fails to move me whatsoever ( lacking in musicality , i believe one reviewer said ) . in my book her renditions just do n't compare to mary black , susan mckeown , or karan casey , though they are pleasant enough . the fiddle playing on & quot ; a little child & quot ; reminds me more of a classical violinist playing irish music ... .very good tone , but too much vibrato , and too orchestrated with multiple violin tracks sounding like the london philharmonic ( e.g . when my love & amp ; i parted ) . on the positive side , there is some excellent guitar , flute , and button accordian playing on here ( e.g . cahil 's jig ) . it 's as if the band is trying too hard to distance themselves from the many other traditional irish groups , with the result that the arrangements are overly complex , and the material just is n't that interesting
