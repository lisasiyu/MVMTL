bizzy fell off biggg time ! ! ! ! man , what to say about this album . first off bone thugs are overrated , they 're good but not great . creepin on ah come up , e-1999 , and art of war being their best material . resurrection , and thug world order are nothing special . maybe the biggest issue they have is finding at least `` decent '' beats . creepin , and e-1999 had that rough rugged gangsta sound . their later efforts have imo really wack , and soft somewhat commercialized beats that they never seem to fit with properly . bone brothers is another example of this . art of war also had some decent beats but way too much soft stuff that does n't properly portray their image . as a whole bone thugs have that special recipe , as solo artists they just do n't cut it . krayzie 's solo albums have a few good songs , the rest being filler junk ! layzie , does not belong as a solo artist . bizzy ca n't pull it off either . as a group they can write blazing lyrics because there is four of them so their verses are n't all that long and come out golden . but doing a whole song , or album by themselves they sound half @ $ $ ed ! on art of war bizzy had developed his hyperspeed flow . now he has given up that flow for his new funky supa wack sometimes slow , sometimes kinda quick , but losta garbage singing flow . bizzy stop singing , u sound like trash ! ! ! ! ! this album suffers from bizzy 's wack flow , and super generic wack beats . it 's funny how people say bone is better than twista . yeah i 'll admit it , not since his tung twista days was twista able to outflow bizzy ( art of war verses ) , but u know what when it comes to a more consistent flow , and understandability twista wins hands down . bone ( especially bizzy ) changes their flow up too much in a single song and sing too d @ mn much ! and this album ( plus all the other bone solo releases ) shows why it takes a group effort to outshine one man ( twista ) on an album . as solo artists no bone member can hold down an entire album by themselves , twista can ! ! where is bone now ? ? ? twista is at the top of the game , and bone fell off long ago
