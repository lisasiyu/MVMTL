dreamer , you stupid little dreamer ( not at all worth import price ) this is the song that i keep singing to myself every time i buy another falkner record ( exceptions being the holiday single , & the sub pop set ) , or any other offering of any kind from any member involved with the best band of the 90 's ( jellyfish ) . and i did n't discover them post break-up , oh no ... .i was in the fanclub and wore the advance copy of bellybutton ( vinyl , yo ! ! ) out on my college radio shift ! i was also in the redd kross fanclub and consider them higher than the jellies ... yeah , i said it . so , you can bet that i had a raging `` you-know-what '' in my pants for this record ! ? ! ? import price and a long wait from japan later , and i am once again ... let down . it has been painfully obvious for a while where the magic dust came from within jellyfish , and this is another testament to andy sturmer 's greatness . i know , they were n't trying to make a jellyfish album , but the songwriting here does n't hold the slightest flicker to say , even a beatnick beatch tune . if the new cars had hired faulkner ( who rhymes as bad as ace frehley in spots ) , instead of rundgren , and they went with the songwriting of 'door to door ' , this would be very close . this goes beyond `` having a retro sound '' and straight into justin timberlake trying to have a retro sound . better yet , if you actually enjoyed any of duran duran 's last two records , then this will knock your socks off ... .in fact , send me $ 30 and you can have this copy . production quality and my sincere love for the past with these three guys , keeps me from comitting this review to one star
