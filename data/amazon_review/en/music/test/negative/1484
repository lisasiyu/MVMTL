george winston ? if you like the music of george winston 's earlier albums , especially the `` seasons , '' december , plains , forest , montana ... ..you will probably not like this one . unfortunately , it is nothing like his earlier works . i would never have fallen in love with his music if it was all like gulf coast blues . this new one is way too heavy , loud , and generally abrasive . i am very sorry to have to say these things , because i am such a big fan of his .
