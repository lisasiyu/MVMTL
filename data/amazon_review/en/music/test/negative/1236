music to take a bullet to the only thing i got out of listening to the title track , protection , is fleeting remembrances of the movie the bodyguard . this was not a good film . i am a great admirer of tracey thorne 's voice and , as i said elsewhere , would listen to her sing the phone book ; but this is not the phone book . this is teenage emotionalizing . though i resonate with the idea of self-sacrifice , the whole point of self-sacrifice is to actually do it , not to talk about how you would or should or might do it should the situation arise . the track is basically like listening to somebody saying , & quot ; you know , i 'd like totally run in front of a bus to save somebody , knowwhamsain ? & quot ; the whole point of self-sacrifice is that it is difficult to do . it certainly is not difficult to talk about doing , though . i do n't know tracey thorne , but i am not really uplifted by the thought of her hypothetically jumping in front of someone to take a bullet for them
