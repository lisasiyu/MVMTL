elvis - 2nd to none cd = bad i ordered `` elvis - 30 # 1 hits '' and this cd was fine . along with that order , i ordered `` elvis 2nd to none '' . the cd case was damaged , and the actual cd contained songs in it that were damaged ... unfortunately it was a gift that i gave someone in another state , which makes it too complicated to return..
