10 years later 2.5 stars hard to believe it has been ten years since load came out . like many metallica fans i recoiled against it , not because of the songs per say , but the whole image change , the shock of metallica being on lollapalloza , the disgust at seeing the arrogant attitudes displayed by hetfild and ulrich towrds metallicas established fan base and the genre of heavy metal in general.it was too much for many people to take , and they rejected load right then and there . that said , with 10 years passing by , one can listen to load is a clear eye ( or ear ) . the fact is that while load is not up to the previous standards of metallica , it isint all that bad of an album , and despite the dramatica image change , it isint `` alternative '' , either . what load is more or less is metallicas interpertation of 70s style blues based hard rock/metal . think black sabbath , ac/dc , sad wings of destiny era judas priest , deep purple , budgie , ufo and thin lizzy . it are these influences that are most heard in load . the mid temp , chunky riffs , the wah-wah pedal drenched solos , simple 4/4 based arrangements . certarinly a big change from the agressive and also progressive nature of previous metallica albums ( even the black album still had agressive and progressive influences ) . the problem with why load doesnt work per say is mainly two fold . one , at 80 minuites , there is quite a bit of filler on it . the hard rock/metal groups in the 70s worked with a 45 minuite frame work at the very most when it came to lps , load would have been a double lp , and the number of successful double lps in any genre of rock can be counted on by one hand ( the only one i can think of in the hard rock/metal genre is led zepplins physical graffiti ) . the filler material really weights the album down . the other problem is the bland , mid range production that bob rock gave the album that robbed the guitars of their power . some of the songs despite the production shortcomings have held up fairly well over the last 10 years . songs such as king nothing , 2x4 , bleeding me , aint my [ ... ] , torn within , the outlaw torn and wasting my hate are fiarly solid . the problem is the rest of the material is not solid , and still has the lifeless sound . had metallica only released one instead of two loads , had metallica had better , more lively production , and had metallica taken the better tracks off reload such as fuel , devils dance , unforgiven ii and where the wild things are , then it very well may have been a near great cd ( think 4 stars or a- grade ) , but alas , metallica went a different route , and the loads are still considered a failure overall . i do not reccomend fans of hard rock/metal purchase the entire load cd , but the individual tracks i listed for ipod make for decent rotation material
