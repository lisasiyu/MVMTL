waste of money i was very eager to buy this cd . i have the cd elixir and i love it . i saw and heard fourplay in atlanta and they were awesome . however , this cd has too much computerized music . too many sythensized voices . very predictable . in my estimation , a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler . i did n't care for this one at all
