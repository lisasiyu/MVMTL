thanks , but no thanks . most people considered this the cheap trick & quot ; comeback & quot ; album . sixteen years after the fact i 'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a & quot ; go-back & quot ; album instead . while cheap trick did n't set the music world on fire with most of their 80 's releases , it was n't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release & quot ; the doctor & quot ; that i actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums . on & quot ; the doctor & quot ; i searched but came up empty . & quot ; lap of luxury & quot ; is n't quite that bad , but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow . i 've made dozens of cheap trick compilations over the years and & quot ; let go & quot ; was the only song that i included off of lol . the thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80 's and early 90 's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the trick back to their rockin ' roots . well let me tell ya , this is far from it . i know . i remember
