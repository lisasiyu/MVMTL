shocked i am shocked . i would have at least thought that the beats on shock value were going to be good ( to make up for the fact that timbaland ca n't rap to save his life ) . even timbaland talks about how much money he makes for beats in his `` hit track '' with nelly furtado and jt . it 's too bad that he sold all his hot beats to other artists and did n't keep any for himself . one thing that he is n't is better than scott storch . keep dreaming timbaland . you are nothing more than a wanna-be lil ' john looping your 'yeah 's and 'oooooh 's in every track that sounds the same as the one before .
