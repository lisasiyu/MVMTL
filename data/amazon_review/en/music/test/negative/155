mediocre rapper takes over the world ! first off , kanye west is about as mediocre a rapper as it comes . he looks plain , sounds plain , and if it was n't for the controversy that surrounds him , everyone would be like `` who cares ? '' but while he sings about jesus and lives like he is a prophet , there is no substance to him and his music . lame beats , hypocritical lyrics , this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today . his interviews show him as arrogant , racist , and unlovable , but it is selling his music and that 's what he cares about . so while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm , he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy ( and their own hypocrisy ) . so let 's be real for a second , because i am about to give you the best cd you will hear in years - it 's a mixture of rap and rock , with ( real ! ) beats , acoustic guitar , splashes of piano , and a voice that can sound like chris martin of coldplay one second and then rap like ll cool j the next ... buy today mat kearney 's `` nothing left to lose . '' the best cd of 2006 and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself
