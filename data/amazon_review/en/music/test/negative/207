all garbage does n't sell in today 's rap market the hot commodities are the albums that have the most materialism , disrespect to women , and `` gangsta fairytales '' . well shawnna 's album has all of the above and her sales are poor . so what does that say for shawnna . she ca n't even sell in a market that caters to commercial bs ! ! ! ! ! ! this album is garbage , shawnna is chi-town garbage and needs to find a new occupation . i suggest her finding either the nearest strip club ( since she is from the chi i suggest arnie 's in harvey ! ) or find the nearest porn studio for a more productive career
