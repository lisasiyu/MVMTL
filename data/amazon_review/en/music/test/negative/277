a shoddy monument to a great artist 's 80th year . five stars for the music but reduced to one star for content and value . value ? ? ? at around $ 135 this box set to mark tony bennett 's 80th birthday year is obviously aimed at the hardcore bennett fan / collector , rather than at the casual buyer . with that in mind one is left wondering what exactly it was that sony/columbia thought they were giving to us that was so special ? what we have ended up with is a frustratingly mixed bag . firstly , the packaging . the picture on amazon seems to be an early mock up of the set , as the finished product is more elaborate . the box is a cube covered in black velour with bennett 's signature embossed into the top . the front of the box has a perspex panel with a pencil portrait of the singer . behind this is a montage of miniature album covers and photos , set slightly back from the panel to give a 3d effect . above this on the top front surface of the box is a small silver metallic plate with bennett 's signature . in the base of the box is a ribbon tag which when pulled reveals a small , hard backed book of approximately 60 pages , again covered in black velour with another small silver metallic plate featuring the singer 's signature . contents of the book are a collection of charcoal and pencil sketches by the singer and a collection of brief ( and i do mean brief ) hand-written personal comments on the albums included in the set . all very nice , but as a fan of the music i would have prefered recording information , anectdotes about the original album releases , session details , etc . at approximately 7.5 '' x 7.5 '' x 7.5 '' , the box will be an awkward if not impossible fit on the shelf beside the rest of your cds . ok - so what about what we really came here for , namely , the music ? this is where the above mentioned frustration comes in . let 's take it album by album . first of all there are several already available cds , but in digitally remastered form , some with and some without bonus tracks . these are : i left my heart in san francisco - no bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release . the art of excellence - no bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release . perfectly frank - no bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release . mtv unplugged - two bonus cuts ( `` just a little street where old friends meet '' / `` when will the bells ring for me ? '' ) and slightly improved sound quality over the previous release . the movie songs - two bonus cuts ( `` a time for love '' / `` the shining sea '' ) and slightly improved sound quality over the previous release . then we have a selection of albums that come under the banner of `` pointless '' as they have already been available for some time , already previously remastered : cloud seven - same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality . the beat of my heart - same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality . if i ruled the world : songs for the jet set - same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality . the tony bennett / bill evans album - an even more puzzling inclusion . not a columbia release , but recorded for the fantasy label in the '70s . this is the original fantasy cd release , not even repackaged for the box set by columbia . it 's just as if they bought a bunch of these from fantasy and popped them into this collection . however , and again frustratingly , this is not the 20 bit remastered edition of this cd that has been available for several years but the non-remastered , sonically inferior release from the late '90s . perhaps fantasy had a few thousand of these that they could n't get rid of because they had been superseded by the remastered edition and unloaded them on sony/columbia ? whatever the reason this is a slipshod inclusion in the set , to say the least . next is one album already previously released and remastered , but here in a slightly amended form . i wan na be around - no noticeable difference in sound quality , but with different bonus cuts from the previous release . the previous cd release of this album included as a bonus , seven tracks from the `` this is all i ask '' album , a somewhat bizzarre and half-baked addition , as all of the tracks from `` this is all i ask '' would have fitted on to the disc making a two-on-one release . for the box set release we have three different bonus tracks `` if i love again '' ( alternate take ) / `` someone to love '' ( alternate take ) / `` indian summer '' . so - if you want all of the bonus material you have to hold on to your ( now deleted ) previous cd release of this album . the next album again comes under the heading of totally pointless : the singles collection - considering this box set is aimed at the hardcore bennett fan and not the casual buyer ( casual buyers do n't drop $ 135 on a whim ) , another `` greatest hits '' variant is completely pointless . something tells me that the people likely to be forking over their hard-earned moolah for this box will already have everything on this disc , probably several times over . heaven forbid sony/columbia should have given the fans something so outrageous as a disc of rare and unreleased tracks instead of this , their umpteenth hits compilation . finally , two albums that finally deliver the goods for the fans . tony bennett sings for two - briefly available on cd many years ago but rapidly withdrawn for some reason . this remastered version offers significant improvement in sound quality over the previous release . when lights are low - first time ever relese anywhere in the world on cd ( so far as i can ascertain ) . an absolute gem . more of this type of album -i.e . never before available on cd- is what this collection needed . so - what do we have at the end of the day for the bennett faithful ? one previously unavaiable on cd release and one long unavailable on cd album , three albums in exactly the same form they are already avaiable in , one album in an inferior version to what is already available , one album with different bonus cuts to its previous release , five albums with remastered sound ( two with bonus cuts ) and , finally , one totally pointless `` hits '' collection . considering that approximately thirty tony bennett albums have never had a cd release , many more are long deleted on the format and bearing in mind the considerable amount of unreleased material in the vaults , this collection is a completely botched undertaking , a missed opportunity and a pretty shoddy commemoration of the man 's 80th birthday . just exactly who executive producer danny bennett and sony/columbia are aiming this box set at is a bit of a mystery . if it is the dedicated fan , then i have to tell all parties involved in this release that we expect a lot more than two unavailable albums , a collection of already avaialble cleaned up recordings and seven -count'em folks- previously unavailable tracks for our $ 135 . just what are the chances , i wonder , of tony bennett 's back catalogue making it to cd before his original fanbase -or for that matter his newer devotees- are all in their graves ? this is a sorry monument to a great artist 's 80th year . ( afterthought : i 'm still puzzled over the unusual number of discs in the set , namely , thirteen . not a dozen , not twenty . but thirteen . go figure . you know what they say about the number 13 - `` ... unlucky for some ... '' . in this case the unlucky ones are mr bennett 's fans . )
