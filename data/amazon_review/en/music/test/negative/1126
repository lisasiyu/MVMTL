battle of the christmas jazz divas ... ho ho ho , what do you know ... the two `` it girls '' of vocal jazz both released holiday cds this year within days of each other ... first it was jane monheit with the ambiguously titled `` the season '' ... then came diana krall 's aptly named `` christmas songs . '' so who emerges victorious in this battle of the christmas jazz divas ? the first thing to consider , of course : who has the most gratuitous glamour shot on the album cover ? diana 's suggestive and/or very uncomfortable pose in some kind of lawn chair wearing a billowy shiny green dress ( strategically revealing as much leg as possible ) is a real contender ... but jane 's heavily airbrushed/photoshopped snow bunny/nymphette get-up ( complete with floating bubbles for no apparent reason ) is the clear winner in this category . on to the tunes ... i have to look closely at jane 's disc before putting it in the cd player ... it 's one of them newfangled `` dualdisc '' deals with a cd on one side and dvd on the other -- you can only tell the difference by looking closely at the tiny little print around the hole in the middle ... once you 've figured that out , you know you 're in for a rocky ride when the soft-rock contempo-easy backbeat of `` this christmas '' kicks in ... you got ta give ms. monheit credit for trying to come up with some fresh material here , but this is some really cringe-inducing stuff ... things do n't get much better with `` merry christmas darling , '' a comatose , melody-free bit of nothing featuring a tinkly electric piano solo and overdubbed backing vocals . things pick up on the more jazzy swingin ' tracks such as `` man with the bag '' and `` sleighride '' ... however on ballads like `` moonlight in vermont '' and `` have yourself a merry litte christmas , '' jane reveals a disturbing tendency toward mariah-esque melisma that will make your skin crawl . the guitar/vocal rendition of `` i heard the bells on christmas day '' is nice , but next thing you know you 're awash in the treacly jazz/pop crossover of `` my grown up christmas list '' and heading straight for the eggnog ... i do give jane a lot of credit , though , for including the somewhat neglected holiday classic `` the christmas waltz '' ( one that diana apparently overlooked or just does n't like ... ) what about the dvd side of this `` revolutionary dualdisc , '' ? wow , folks ... it 's amateur hour at epic records ... a faceless actor in the shadows pretending to be a radio host interviews jane ( looking refreshingly like a normal person ) about a few of the songs on the album , interspersed with badly lip-synched `` videos '' of those songs which consist entirely of soft-focus waist-to-head shots of ms. monheit uncomfortably hamming it up for the camera.. yikes ... oh , and you can also listen to the entire album in `` enhanced stereo '' ( whatever that is ) ... the best plan is to simply skip the flip side ... better yet , save yourself a few bucks and get the normal cd version if you intend to buy this album despite its weaknesses ( when it 's available again , that is : the original discs were recalled as part of the sony copy protection `` rootkit '' debacle ... ) decision : diana krall over jane monheit by a ( gentle ) knockout ...
