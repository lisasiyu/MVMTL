terrible garbage . anyone ever see any of these rap `` artists '' perform live ? they 're the most boring , derivative `` entertainers '' in the world . they walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and yell their lyrics . they go from talking on records to yelling on stage . quite a stretch . all this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying `` yeah ! '' `` uh-huh ! '' `` what ! '' `` that 's right ! '' `` uh ! '' etc . get real . meanwhile , the only `` music '' provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage . it makes for the most dull , predictable `` concert '' you 'll ever see . i ca n't wait until all this nonsense just disappears . in a world of common sense , these idiots would still be flipping burgers at mcdonald 's .
