if he is following bright eyes , he has a lot of maturing to do first of all , this album mirrors bright eyes in so many ways , it 's almost ridiculous . he sings about photographs , nbc , drinking . bright eyes song old soul song is all about developing a photograph . let 's not sh** ourselves has conor yelling about nbc , abc , and cbs ( two of which an angle has in change the world ) and bright eyes sings about drinking in about 1/4 of his songs . also , kris has mastered the bright eyes singing style . this is not a negative thing , it 's just very similar . but as for the album itself , minding the bright eyes comparision , it is about 3 miles away from a masterpiece . that being said , at least it 's on the road to a masterpiece , albeit far far away . songs like true love and a way with words are fantastic and shine on the album . songs like white horses and green water have an strong energy and really keep you interested in what else kris has to offer . but too many songs just leave the listener bored and asking `` when is he going to stop singing about getting drunk ? '' songs like born in a bottle and angry drunk are pretentiously long and lyrically boring . going back to bright eyes , the only reason that songs like the big picture work is because the lyrics are so brilliant . kris does n't have this lyrical ability yet . however , i am excited about the future of an angle . i think in the next coming years if kris can mature a little , both musically and lyrically , he 'll make an album that 's brilliant . an album like bright eyes ' `` i 'm wide awake it 's morning '' ( which i believe is his best ) . maybe he should just lay off the drinking .
