sucks this cd sucks so much . it 's the worst casualties cd ever . it has two good songs and the rest are completely horrible and they all sound the same . and i 'm not just saying that because they 're becoming more known/sell-out and stuff . this is seriously one of the worst cd 's i own and i bought it the day it came out because i am a big casualties fan and they were talking about this cd being one of their most hardcore and creative works . the only good things about this cd are that there are pretty okay lyrics , and finally we hear some backup vocals from the other members of the band , which was only heard in a couple songs in on the frontline . they need a new singer or something . and i agree with everyone who gives this cd a poor revie
