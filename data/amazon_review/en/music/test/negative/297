i did n't think that they could get any gayer.. ( is that a word ? gayer ? ? ? ) listening to this album is like receiving a long slow enema . i still have no idea what people see in this much overated band . i understand the comparisons to u2 ( which , by the way , is a far superior band ) , but pink floyd ? ? pink floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically ! ! creep is their only good song ... ..there i said it
