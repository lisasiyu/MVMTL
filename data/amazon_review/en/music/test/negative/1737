at last ! an x album i do n't like ! here i thought they were infallible and they go do this one-off `` ner ner '' music that inspires intimate thoughts regarding blood relations and livestock . i played it backwards and not only did i sober up , but my wife came back to me , my dog came back to life , my truck got fixed , the bank took the lien off my house and i bowled a perfect game ! signed , epsteinsmutha
