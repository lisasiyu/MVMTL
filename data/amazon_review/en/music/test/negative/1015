another good bad that did n't know when to quit as a big feelies fan and a big galaxie 500 fan , luna would seem like the perfect band for me . and they were , for 2 releases anyway . this band has run out of things to say . dean wareham 's lyrics grow more inane with each release . ex-feelie stanley demeski is gone , replaced by a rather indistinguished drummer . buy lunapark or bewitched instead ... penthouse is okay , but the decline started there
