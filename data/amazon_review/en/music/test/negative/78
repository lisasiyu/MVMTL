garbage compared to & quot ; let 's get free & quot ; their first album & quot ; let 's get free & quot ; was a 5 star masterpiece , unfortunately this one is horrible . there are only 2 good tracks on this album , both which are deep and reminiscent of & quot ; let 's get free. & quot ; one is & quot ; sellin d.o.p.e. & quot ; and the other is & quot ; look around & quot ; which is already featured on beatnuts ' & quot ; musical massacre , & quot ; and to make things worse they chop off 3 minutes of the song . the other tracks are boring and uninspiring . they completely changed up their entire formula as if to impress the commercial heads who know nothing about real hip hop . the beats are either recycled or & quot ; snare- happy , throw them bows & quot ; type beats that are for a whole different crowd of listeners then their first cd . it 's much like a book with no pages . shine with no substance . it 's too bad that with their first joint they dropped a gem on us and then with this one strayed away from their roots . i 'm optimistic that they will soon get back to the old dead prez formula that made & quot ; let 's get free & quot ; so great . but until then , do n't pick this one up
