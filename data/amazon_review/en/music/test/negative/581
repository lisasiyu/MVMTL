only for die hards with perverse , mike edwards set out to prove that jesus jones was more than a `sunny , breezy pop band ' , what he ended up proving was that if they were n't no one was interested . sad to say , but pop hooks were what people expected from jj , and actually there are some here , but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook . stick with doubt , that 's where jj peaked , even if some claimed they had `sold out ' . here they are pushing the boundaries , but that does n't always make for a great listening experience
