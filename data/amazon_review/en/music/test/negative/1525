starts to go downhill at this point in my opinion , hank williams jr. - when he did it right - was about as good as it gets in country music . you listen to his records like `` old habits '' and `` whiskey bent & hell bound '' and it is hard to get much better than that . but with this album hank jr started showing glimpses of what would become his future ... and it 's not good . he has a terrible version of `` the tennessee stud '' and everything just seems so overdone . he 's best on songs like `` i do n't care if tomorrow never comes '' , `` ramblin my shoes '' and `` all my rowdy friends have settled down '' - everything else is just filler . and with future albums the filler would get worse until he eventually got to the point he would write things like `` this ai n't dallas '' and `` fax me a beer '' . too bad , terrible waste of talent .
