borrrrrring i feel compelled to add my review , as i bought this cd based on what i'd read here ... what a disappointment . tedious , predictable , unimaginative `` electro-pop '' . there 's so much more interesting stuff out there , and i listen to alot . i found this cd remarkably disposable . no offense..
