disappointed ok , i 'm down with funk , and i 've been down with the resergence in fusion/bugaloo/funk/jazz like mmw , greyboy , galactic . but i 'm sorry , the turkish instruments just do not work here . try imagining james brown with an irish jig band playing along . get my point ? they just do n't mix . do n't get me wrong , i 'm down with bfe . but did they have to throw the turks into every jam ? the mix was just too caustic
