overrated totally overrated . felt compelled to write a review because everyone else proclaims this release is perfection and the mix of the year . disc one is strong and on for the first 4 tracks and then becomes totally monotinous and dull until the closing track which is superb . disc two does n't move me at all except for its classic intro with orbital . if you are looking for good stuff for your crate seek out the aforementioned on 12 '' and do n't waste your time buying this .
