thom 's tourettes ok first off i love radiohead -pablo honey up through the electronic swarms of kid a , as well as the avant-garde amnesiac . so i guess i am confused why i dont like this ... it 's boring ? it 's like white bread , flat and blah ... and with no real substance ? thom is n't covering any new territory here lyrically , or melodically . the electronics do n't supplement his voice either ... each song opens with inessential spastic ticking of naked techno beats ... then a layer more or two before thom chimes in with a droning melody that sounds like he 's dragging his feet over routine tones . i 'm left understimulated and quite unimpressed . i even question thom 's concept of quality ... surely he knew that this was subpar ... nevertheless it was packaged , shipped and is displayed on shelves at the right eye level to lure dollars- all because of name recognition . we learned our lesson with george w. bush , let 's not relive it in the vein of cult music . if only i had an eraser , that i could wipe this disappointment from my memory
