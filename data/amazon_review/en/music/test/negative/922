give me the first two records instead ... okay , some of this is awesome : the ballads ai n't gone 'n ' give up on love and life without you are the best ; change it is a great blues-rocker , and his guitar livens up even weaker material like say what ! and come on , pt . 3 . still , this is a thin album overall . lookin ' out the window ; look at little sister ; you 'll be mine and empty arms are among stevie 's worst . stick to the first two records instead , plus maybe in step .
