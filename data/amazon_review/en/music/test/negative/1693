i love this album , but ... .. ... somehow sundazed screwed up the remastering . several tracks sound overmodulated . it 's the same sound you get when you overload a digital recorder , and i suspect that 's what happened somewhere along the line when this cd was made . it is a loud cd . it 's frustrating because it 's obvious that sundazed used the session tapes . if not for the added distortion , this would be a great sounding cd from start to finish . if this had happened to one of the beatles cds , the problem would have been corrected by now . but since it 's & quot ; only & quot ; a raiders album , i guess we just have to put up with this sloppiness . by the way , sundazed did do a & quot ; fix & quot ; on their & quot ; revolution & quot ; cd , which had the same problem . the noise was very obvious on that release , so i guess sundazed felt they had to redo it . as for the other prr cd they released in '96 , & quot ; something happening & quot ; , it has the same problem and apparently no fix has been done . luckily , some cuts on & quot ; happening & quot ; are totally free of the noise
