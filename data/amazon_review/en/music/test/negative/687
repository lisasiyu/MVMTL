disappointing given jon brion 's obvious talent it seems to me that jon brion has a split personality as a musician . on one hand , he is an austere and formal composer in the classical sense ( see his brilliant symphonic score for magnolia ) . and on the other hand , he is a pop magician , creating hooks within a beatlesesque format as a producer and songwriter . with eternal sunshine of the spotless mind , jon brion taps into the latter musical personality , and given the context of a movie score , it feels ill-suited . the scale of a movie score requires greater complexity in the composition than brion 's pop wizardry , as superlative as it is on albums by rhett miller , aimee mann , and the like , as well as on his own solo effort , meaningless . most of the pieces on this soundtrack are mere shells of pop songs albeit with some winds and strings . the difficulty and the sense of traditional musical history that informed the greatness of the magnolia score is all but lost on this soundtrack . as another reviewer commented , most of the pieces are extremely short , less than two minutes . jon brion clearly has the brains . so why not show it ?
