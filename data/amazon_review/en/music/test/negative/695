what a waste ... the songs in this cd were sang by thousand other singers million times . unless if it 's done differently with new arrangements , new style , better performance it 's a total waste . my suggestion , please find new songs , there are plenty out there . give the new writers a chance , pay them few dollars and give them some royalties . and you il divo , will sound more unique and different . after all you have great voices
