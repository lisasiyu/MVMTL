five star album , two star dvd-a mixing ca n't say enough about this album . i got it as traditional cd several months ago , and it is , by far , the best music i 've bought all year . due the sparse selection of dvd-a , i was thrilled to see it offered here in this format . the positive reviews on the mix were even more encouraging . i 've got a dedicated dvd-audio player run through a pioneer 135 watts per channel amp running klipsh kg 5.5 mains and comperable center , surrounds and sub . -not a totally high-end system , but it 'll hold its own . i have to say that i was disapointed when i heard the album for one reason : knopfler 's voice is 95 % relegated to the center channel . perhaps it 's a matter of taste , but there is way too much separation between voice and instuments . the idea of 5 channel separation is a wonderful thing when done right -any donald fagen , hotel california , but there 's a fine line in the mixing between perfection and annoying . in my opinion , this one crosses that line . some may love it ; to me , it 's unbalanced and makes for a frustrating listening experience . -bria
