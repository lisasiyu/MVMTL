not the best example of the genre . the planets seem to have a problem deciding what they'l be . are they a band that puts a rock twist on classical ? are they a bloated chamber orchestra ? are they a rather sparse symphony ? what is on this album is a good example of mediocrity . if you want good poppy classical music , check out vanessa mae . if you want good classical music , look at the scores of albums arranged by truly great composers . the planets try hard and fall flat . perhaps in another couple of albums they 'll have found their voice , but it certainly is n't on classical graffit
