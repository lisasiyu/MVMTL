this is not the ryodisc radio one live sessions these are pre-canned radio shows with the ever unbearable alexis korner talking on top of the songs as wow cool groovy dj `` intro '' . the old radio one was a real live in studio show that was great . these are mostly studio released cuts from the first and second album mixed with dj chatter and one hendrix interview with a phoney , well let 's hear that song now shall we intro to the recorded album version ! as one who has been seriously burned by repackaged hendrix stuff in the past , and as a loong time fan ( i remember when he lived and died ) it takes alot for me not to recommend all things hendrix , but i can not recommend this . find the actual live radio one recording , not these packaged cut and pasted radio shows
