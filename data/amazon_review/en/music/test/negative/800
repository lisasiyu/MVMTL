just buy built to spill albums instead ... really an album that should be played in the background , if at all - it 's slow and wandering music wo n't keep your attention for long and rightly so . and other reviewers are correct about the lyrics , if you 're still paying attention you 'll be less than impressed . i 'm amazed at how many reviews can be written here with absolutely no reference to built to spill - a band this album really really wants to be . it 's true that this album , with its guitar work and focus on an atmosphere over progression , sounds very very much like parts of the built to spill albums . but would i compare this album to bts ? or death cab ? no chance . it 's just got nothing to offer other than background - nothing is being created here . no novelty . the horns people talk about in other reviews are out of place and forced - like your best friend 's idea you ca n't talk him out of . two stars seems a little harsh , but it 's a gift . i ca n't honestly recommend people buy this album when you can get built to spill or death cab for cutie albums which give you this and so so much more . ****update**** trust me , the built to spill comparison is valid . everyone should go listen to them both and i promise you 'll get it
