boring ... . my sister got this cd for christmas of '05 , and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight . i thought the music industry was starting to recover from the `` boy band '' era , until bands like , fall out boy , all american rejects , and the click five came out . apparently life is only about love to them , they never sing about any other aspect of life . the click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry . at this rate , originality in music , will be a time long lost
