fair ... just fair the offspring..a band who draws inspiration from some of the best music around ( the damned , tsol , agent orange , adolescents , and di ) , have great record label that is responsible for new records/re-issues from tsol , the damned , and other great legendary punk artists , and a band who used to be really great punk revival have truly disappointed me with records like this . i fell in love with the offspring when i bought smash..after that , i proceeded to collect ignition and ixnay.and still , i loved them..but i was iffy on this..i mean i knew of songs like pretty fly and why dont you get a job and how bad they were , but songs like kids arent alright made me a buyer ... i must say , i was rather impressed with this and decided that i underrated it ... that was 3 years ago . now , i think this album is just okay..i mean its good enough to be able to warrant a stay on my windows media player on my laptop , but as for keeping the disc , it isnt . i say get this..get it cheap..rip it to your comp and then sell off . it gets old fast
