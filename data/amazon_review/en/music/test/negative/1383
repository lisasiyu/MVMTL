sorry marc ... just do your thing . i have to say something about this cd ... i mean , i know marc anthony tried to do something different this time and he did it , but pop is not his thing ... '' mended '' is a weak album , with 2 or 3 good songs as `` love wo n't get any better '' `` she mends me '' and maybe even `` tragedy '' that 's all . i used to be a fan of marc anthony 's salsa albums ... but this is actually pop from hell . sorry marc ... just do your thing
