just not the same if you 're into classical music , you know how different the same symphony performed by two different conductors and orchestras can sound . same here . if you really love this score like i do , i think you 'll be disappointed in the difference in sound compared to the original . i 'd give this a higher rating if it was the only version available . but since the original is available on cd , there 's no reason to buy this imposter . there 's only 5 minutes more from lion in winter , and the mini-mary score is nothing special
