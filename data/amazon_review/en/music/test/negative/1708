gould reconsidered and so should we gould 's '55 recording of the goldberg variations was a challenging statement from a very young man . perhaps it needed to be played this way , at least once , or perhaps gould needed to play it this way at that time . he thought better of it and re-recorded the work in '82 and it is this last interpretation that will stand the test of time . it is an interpretation that is much closer to the accepted sound , but how beautiful it is ! bach does n't need eccentric rhythms and tempi to gain attention and it turned out that neither did gould . you can still hear his vocalise ( love it or loathe it - i love it ) , but the passion , depth and strength of the later work overshadows his earlier effort and nearly everyone else 's efforts too . hear them both and then decide for yourself richard maycoc
