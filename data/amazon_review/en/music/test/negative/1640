all i can say is : why ? why did they have to produce this album . from start to finish all the tracks blend to white noise in my ear . this was a severe disappointment . even more disappointing then eve . at least eve had some tracks that you could 'aquire a taste ' for not so with on air . if you 're a collector buy it as cheaply as you can and let it gather dust otherwise do n't waste your time and money there are many more memorable cd 's out there . i , unfortunately , own the cd and have listened to it many times and i ca n't even begin to tell you what one single lyric is on the album . that is if there are any .
