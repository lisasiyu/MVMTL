jonny , what have you done to yourself ? this disc is a huge disappointment ! what happened to the young blues guitar slinger i really liked ? he has completely changed his style and i was hoping we finally had a new blues musician that would grow and grow into a blues great ! this in not blues at all . i suspect his producers at a & m thought they saw someone to make money from , but this is eclectic garbage although his voice is still great . go back to what you do best jonny - blues .
