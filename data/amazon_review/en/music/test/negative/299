1-1/2 stars -- dumb , dry and trashy first things first : this compilation should n't even be called jermaine dupri presents ... because jd is only involved with two songs on here ( he stars in `` got ta getcha '' , and he produces one other song ) . anyway , i 'm not exactly sure what possessed him to put together young , fly & flashy vol . 1 ; whether he was just thinking about `` the way we were '' , or if he just wanted to showcase some new young talent . actually , maybe i should n't have said the latter , because it looks like jd dug up some of the most untalented people ever . but things are n't very inspiring with the known artists , like when j-kwon and daz try to save `` 10 toes '' . and i wonder how long ago that song was made because in it , j-kwon says he 's 17 , but that 's how old he was when `` tipsy '' came out . i do n't know why jd decided to dig up has-beens kp & envyi for the dismal `` put cha hands up '' ( that title even sounds like it came from 1997 ) , and as for `` i think they like me '' , if it 's really dem franchize boyz ' song , how come they 're the only ones in there that ca n't rap ? most of the rappers on here are unknowns , but in the end they really are n't worth knowing because even jd is a better rapper than they are . miss b 's `` grown man '' suffers from a corny chorus , and t. waters ' `` throw 'd off '' is just plain wack . and cato 's lazy `` so what '' made me say just that . but the album 's nadir is the title track , performed by young capone , midnight , champagne shawty and c-dirt . not only is there lackluster production , but the guys ' rapping is so bad that they make chingy look like rakim . the only saving grace to this whole compilation is bun-b 's verse on the otherwise terrible `` kodak moment '' . unlike that title , though , this album is n't anything to remember . if jermaine ever makes a young , fly & flashy vol . 2 , i 'll be the first person not to get it . anthony ruper
