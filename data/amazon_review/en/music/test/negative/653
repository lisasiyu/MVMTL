so very disappointing i 'm a loyal orton fan ; trailer park is her best , and i 'm a fan the `` other side of daybreak '' . this cd is a complete disappointment . it is trite , boring , and political in a very dull and usual way ; it has none of the distinctive thoughtfulness , charm , and melancholy that so characterize most of orton 's work . i get the distinct feeling that she did n't have this cd in her , but just put it out there because there were so many ( ourselves ) who were waiting . orton 's merit is that her songs come from her heart ; these songs come from her head . these songs sound little different from so much soulless folk-pop , and have all the authenticity of a millionaire rockstar whining about being downtrodden . we wish beth the best ; but we also wish she would give us her best ; and if she ca n't do that , well , we 'll be content with her 'classics '
