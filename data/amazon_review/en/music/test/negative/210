white bread christmas ? indeed ... ... . i 've always thought of diana krall as a sellout . i 've been told that she was not a singer by choice , that record execs saw dollar signs and `` encouraged '' this mediocre pianist to sing . they were lucky that krall has a nice voice quality and sings in tune , and can swing in a very middle of the road , 2 levels above white bread kind of way . but as a performer , she comes off as an emotionless robot . her overall delivery is a droning monotone . every song is performed the same way , in a husky , lilting , and ultimately boring as hell manner . since norah jones has effectively blown krall out of the water in terms of sales , what could they think of as a comeback ? how bout a christmas album ! nothing says sellout like christmas . and i actually like some of those songs , but to be honest , i 'd rather sit around and sing them with my friends than listen to krall sleepwalk through this set of traditional tunes . in fact , i 'd rather go christmas caroling in the gaza strip than listen to this unimaginative , boring , lifeless collection of performances . ok , maybe i 'm being too harsh . but once a tool , always a tool . krall is too much part of the machine , so if she did have an original idea , i doubt there would be anyone in the company that would let her try it . some the arrangements on this disc have nice orchestration , but overall sound very functional , commercial , and bland . which fit perfectly with krall 's bland delivery . even when she tries to emote on mel torme 's great composition `` the christmas song '' , it sounds disingenuine . i think of diana krall as a product . when a business school grad goes to work at a corporation , they come in with profit as their goal . so whatever product they want to market and sell to the american public , and hopefully the world market , they want to have the most widespread appeal possible . diana krall is the coca cola sugar water of music . sugary sweet , a buxom blond with very little nutrition or substance in her artistry . but the vast public wants a cd , i mean , product , that they can put on at a dinner party and basically talk over and say , `` we love jazz ! here 's our diana krall cd . '' diana 's pose on the front cover says it all . pretty and all dressed up but just lays there lifeless . it 's almost a pose of defeat . even sellouts have their limits
