another good band falls victum of modern day emo crap . i 'm going to be straight up , the title says it all . thrice was a great band , illusion of safety is one of the most incredable albums ever . now they sound like every other band out there today . personally i hate emo , i grew out of that crap along time ago . i 'm sorry if i offend people in saying that . i just dont see any talent in it . thrice used to be my favorite band . being a guitarist myself , i enjoyed identity crisis ' true hardcore sound , and illusion of safety 's amazing creativity , but the artist in the ambulance and this new cd are crap . if your emo , then give it a shot , but if your sick of the new-age emo crap you ca n't avoid every time you turn on the radio , put this album back . it 's time to move on thrice fans . they came.. they rocked.. there done
