comin ' with a 2.5 ! keith sweat 's 1991 release did n't come off as the usual or other releases of his . for starters , keith is mostly known for his bumping slow jams and he did n't let us down with the ones on here . as a matter of fact , that was the only thing that kept this one from being a total disaster . once getting to track 6 with `` i want to love you down '' the lp quickly prepares you for the whining and begging that makes him so popular . it could n't have got any better with `` give me what i want '' featuring silk on background and taking the song to the next level of sexiness . silk and mr . sweat invites you with `` the ten commandments of love '' with the background vocals saying , `` ... come on , come on , come on , come on baby ... '' . maybe this release would have been better if it was an entire keith sweat & silk release
