a tribute that does n't deliver i was so moved when i first watched hedwig that i bought the dvd , soundtrack and broadway soundtrack . what a masterful bit of writing and performance ; just astonishing . after i listened to this tribute , i just could n't write a positive review . the magic and emotion is not there . the feeling is gone . i know this review is short , but not much really needs to be said other than : save your money and buy the original
