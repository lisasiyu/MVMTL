un-unique new york i came across levy 's profile on a popular personals/music website , and i found nothing but good reviews and great comments , so i decided to spend my extra birthday money on their album . as i sat and listened to it , i kept wondering if i accidentally received the wrong cd ; everything i heard sounded like coldplay . now , i do n't have anything against cover bands , but when you copy someone else 's music , you should at least give them proper respect and acknowledge that you 've made their music into your own . on this album , levy mimicked much of the trademark guitar sound and texture of coldplay . much of their personally filtered reviews taunt their work as completely original , and at times , they even sound as if levy might be musically revolutionary or something . in regards to the actual musical content of the album , i find it lukewarm , stale and , well , plain boring . steer clear of this one if you 're looking for something new and different . after seeing several reviews stating this kenny anderson guy wrote my review , i figured i should add a realname tag to show that more than just kenny anderson thinks levy sucks
