infuriating ! the biggest idiots i 've ever heard except for rappers of course . this is a band that could have been a great band if it was n't for the goofy vocalist botching and making a joke out of everything . the musicianship is definately there , excellent musicianship , but comic book lyrics and vocals trash it all ! after a few songs of this , the humor gets old real quick . it 's sad to see such gifted southern musicians live up to an outdated stereotype played out by a childish vocalist who thinks all of life is a joke . if it was n't for this , and they had gotten a real vocalist to sing the songs seriously , they probably would have been as big as lynyrd skynryd , and their musicianship gives strong evidence of what should have been , instead of them being reduced to dime store novelty status ! thank god that lynyrd skynyrd , ozark mountain daredevils , and molly hatchett got it right , and did the south proud with some dignity
