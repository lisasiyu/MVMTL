`` try this '' - please do not try this ! i used to be a big pink 's fan . i loved her first cd . it was the only cd i listened to for 5 months straight . then , her second cd came out . it was a big disappointment . something in her style changed , which i did not like . but i still faithfully purchased this cd , hoping that she would put out some good music . but i seriously regretted buying the cd . i guess now pink is famous , she gets to decide what direction she wants her music to go . obviously , she is always been a punk rock chic deep down inside . now i realized that the style in her first cd was n't really who she was . it was just something that her record company put her in so that she could be accepted by the general mass . now pink has millsions of faithful fans , she can care less about being accpeted . she takes off her mask and we see this rocker girl . some people love her more , some people like her less . i belong to the latter group . the music in this cd is mostly rock with a little bit pop beat . if that 's what you like , buy this cd . purple_garde
