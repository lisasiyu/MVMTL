what 's become of the great american songbook ? oo god , one more time ! this is a collection of the cream of the cream of the great american songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to american culture . this rate # 1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series . over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully . i am not a dictator but i would vote for a law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of american culture . more than that , the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way . that 's the deal : there is truth missing , there is a sensation of a money-make production . mellow arrangements , neglectable performances , lacking creativeness . to be completely forgotten some years ahead .
