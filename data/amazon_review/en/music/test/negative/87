disappointing ..these 3 have worldwide status and have produced some amazing tracks so i ca n't understand why they put this out . the album lacks quality , imagination , energy , and inspiration . there is n't one g funk influnced track on the album but a lot of slow/mid tempo stuff . i 've tried listening to this twice and managed skipping the whole cd in a short space of time . to you gangsta listeners out there , do n't waste your money ... .i ai n't gon na go on any more about this album so if you do n't believe me..buy it
