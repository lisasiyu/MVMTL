do n't bother there 's a reason that there are over 200,000 albums ranked before this one . even if i was a big fan of rap , i would be a fan of bad rap . if you enjoy droning , monotone vocals with no real music to back it up then maybe this is for you , but even then i would n't recommend it . maybe try grits or something ( try anything else ... please ! ! )
