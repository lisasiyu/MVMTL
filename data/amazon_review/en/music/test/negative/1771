a step backwards i liked the first two afterhours compilations , mostly because they are so downbeat and emotional . there was a concept in those albums . now global underground ( in my point of view , a very unrespectable company or `` label '' ) gave the opportunity to amateur computer-music geeks to become a part of what was a fine series of compilations ( and good compilations are so hard to find ) without using any criteria . there is a lack of criteria also at choosing unrepresentative tracks by major artists like cinematic orchestra and gusgus . two stars , because i only like no more than four songs . and they 're no big deal at all .
