ugh terrible . i love alternative music , but this trash is hardly worth listening to . i understand this is `` experimental '' and `` innovational '' but it is a loose can of worms . none of the music is melodic . some of the riffs are pretty neat with interesting rhythems and intruiging sounds but when thurston moore or kim gordon ( who was 39 when this was recorded . waaaay past her prime if you ask me ) tries to sing , it all falls apart . the guitarists are very , very talented and deserve recognition . but , honestly , i ca n't see how they ca n't be like the pixies and be talented but produce good and listenable music at the same time . i gave it 2 stars because `` drunken butterfly '' is an awesome song and actually worth listening to all the way through
