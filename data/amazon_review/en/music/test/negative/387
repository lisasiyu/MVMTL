too much ballad , too little honky-tonk i 'm a big george strait fan and was disappointed by this album . this is not as upbeat as some of his other works , which would not be a problem if the slower pieces matched up well against classics like 'i can still make cheyenne . ' sadly , they do n't . moreover , even some of the upbeat works on this cd were not up to the high standards that strait has set for himself . the end result is a cd with a couple of good songs and a lot of chaff . this cd starts off strongly enough , with a piece called 'if the whole world was a honky tonk ; ' this is upbeat and well written ( strait did not write any of the pieces on this album ) . however , the album then starts swinging wildly between some outstanding pieces such as 'texas , ' strait 's cover of merle haggard 's 'the seashores of old mexico ' and the hit 'she let herself go ' and some substandard pieces such as 'oh , what a perfect day , ' the upbeat but uninspired 'high tone woman ' and the disappointing title track . by far the worst piece on this cd is 'good news , bad news , ' a duet between strait and lee ann womack . this is a long piece that has clearly been designed to show off womack 's vocal range . the song feels like it 's missing a verse and like strait really is just along for the ride . this is a cd that i would only recommend for die-hard strait fans . there is not enough solid material for the casual fan or for a true twang aficionado to bother purchasing this instead of waiting for the best pieces to show up on a later greatest hits compilation
