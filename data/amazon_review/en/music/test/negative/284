hillbilly what ? ok , i bought this cd and it gets 2 stars one each for the songs `` believe '' and `` i 'm building bridges '' . the other songs are horrible . ronnie is the lead vocalist for a very good reason ! they were very smart to get vince gill ( the best ! ) to do background vocals on bridge 's . save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale !
