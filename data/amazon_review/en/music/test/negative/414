more like bad let me just say , i 'm not a seattle scenester , i 'm not illiterate and i do n't like the lashes . sorry ! i found a copy of this ep in the used bin at my local record store so i thought i 'd give it a spin - it was only a couple bucks . needless to say it 's going back to the used bin . imitating the strokes and the killers is really played-out right now . what 's the point ? these songs are derivative with a capital `` d '' . the world does n't need one more moody-looking band with perfectly styled hair doing an inferior version of what 's already out there . the music itself is almost passable but the lyrics are really dumb ! it 's like reading a 12 year-old girl 's diary . even my friend said `` it sounds like these guys are about one year too late . '' the lashes are so derivative and unoriginal i almost suspect they were `` manufactured '' to be popular . absolutely soulless .
