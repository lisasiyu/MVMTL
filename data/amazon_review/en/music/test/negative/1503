the reason why shred is dead when i was 15 and first discovering guitar , i loved this album . listening to it now , it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.vai is technically very impressive , but the man ca n't write a decent song to save his life . vai 's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians , lay down a generic rhythm track , and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album . technique on your instrument is never a bad thing , however , technique should be just a means to an end , not the end itself . and that 's what no shred guitarist seems to understand . the fact that shred guitarists like vai are n't more popular is due to one thing : they 're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs . there 's a good reason why non-guitarists hate this stuff . basically , once you get past the `` gee , that 's neat '' factor , this album , and nearly all of vai 's music , feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.to be blunt , this is what john tesh or yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards . not only that , his guitar tone is absolutely awful . very thin , high pitched , and brittle sounding . the best thing on here is the blatant van halen rip-off `` the audience is listening '' : the rest is just masturbation . vai 's best work has always been as a sideman , especially the stuff he did with david lee roth , because then he 's forced to play actual songs , rather than 5 minute long , tedious guitar solos . on his own , he 's just unbearable . i considered giving this one star , but i gave it 2 stars due to the fact that vai can play , it 's just what he 's playing that 's the problem .
