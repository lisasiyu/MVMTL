agnetha at her worst okay . agnetha 's first album was number one in uk or whatever , but i think that this is just another abba album ... i love the catchy song : i ca n't shake loose ( no 65 uk ) , wrap your arms around me ( no 45 uk ) , man , and take good care of yor children . after this album , agnetha produced some better work which were never released as a single in uk . a very disapointing album , and it was recorded with an excellent producer-engineer too quickly ( from the first recording to the release was 5 months ! )
