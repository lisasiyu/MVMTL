shoot me now i saw these guys live at a ludacris/rufio/walkman/phantom planet concert and i seriously wanted to shoot myself . not only do i hate girl rock bands to begin with , the singer was so annoying . their performance in general was just really really bad , i mean the girl playing the keyboard looked like she just wanted to die . they kept playing more and more songs , more than all the other bands , it was like a nightmare that would n't end . her voice is annoying , no range or style whatsoever , the music has nothing going for it . if u 're into courtney love and all that crud , u may like this , otherwise bail on this one
