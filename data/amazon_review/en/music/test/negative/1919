a very disappointing follow-up to his first cd . i have schimmel 's first cd , & quot ; comes clean , & quot ; which is absolutely hilarious . so , i ordered this cd and waited for it to arrive with much anticipation . as soon as i received it , i could n't wait to listen to it with my husband , also a fan of the first cd . unfortunately , we barely snickered throughout the entire cd . maybe because his style was no longer new to us
