a misinterepretation of beloved latin classics there is no doubt the artist 's voice is beautiful . however , the interpretation of certain songs by a man and child are way off . for example , & quot ; tengo una muneca & quot ; is not a lullaby , but an upbeat children 's song and to have a child drone it out debases such a mexican classic . one of many aweful and inacurate musical interpretations on this misguided cd . for the best and most classic spanish children 's songs turn to the tender and playful & quot ; cri-cri. & quot
