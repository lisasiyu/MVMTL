misleading title it would have been better to label it `` best of mannheim steamroller christmas '' than this misleading title . it is just a rehash of selections from their previous albums ; all of which i already have so this was a waste of $ 14 cause stores wo n't take back opened cd 's . ( anybody got a shrinkwrap machine handy ? ? )
