this is a rather stupid album however , with all the good material in the early 90 's coming out i was suckered into listening to just about every little thing . this has some rather blah songs on it , and the thing is they try to sound like everyone , but themselves . on `` dead & bloated '' they try to sound like danzig , `` sex type thing '' which is the best song on the whole album they sound like alice in chains , `` wicked garden '' and `` plush '' they sound like pearl jam , and probably the only song that they do sound like themselves is `` creep '' , and with this one i have some rather bad memories of this as i remember this is one of the songs i heard all the time when i first moved down to florida . i moved down with no job , or no car , and i was bored out of my skull , and no social life either , as no one seemed to speak to one another . as the lyrics go `` feeling uninspired ... think i 'll start a fire '' . now that i was down in florida full time i was n't having a good time , and i know even now listening to this song makes me remember those hard first few months down here as if they were yesterday , and it 's because at times i feel it was . everything else on this album was too perverted , or just too long-winded .
