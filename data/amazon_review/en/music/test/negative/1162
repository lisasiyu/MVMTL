the worst of the lot joe misses the mark with this one . in fact , this album does n't compare to his others even remotely . maybe he thought he was doing what was popular , or maybe he just wanted something different , but , to me , this album sounds like video game audio . if you want some real joe , buy surfing with the alien , flying in a blue dream , the extremist and/or is there love in space
