still overproduced but not half bad best song : moving oleta worst song : secret biggest let down : i 'm gon na climb that mountain and sky full of angels . ( patty loveless could have done wonders with these ! ) other good songs : if i had any sense left at all ; room to breathe ; he gets that from me ; once you 've learned to be lonely ; forgettable : love revival ; somebody ; o.k . - the duet with vince gill which made such an impression on me that i ca n't even remember the name of the tune . the cd is way overproduced just like reba 's normal fare . but the material here is n't half bad . `` moving oleta '' should have been released as the single and should be winning awards for `` song of the year '' . by far one of reba 's most moving performances !
