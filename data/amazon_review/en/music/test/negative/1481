cd song selection for this box set could of been much better of all the billboard cds , this box set of 85-89 does not contain enough of the top hits of this period . most of the songs are of the flip side vintage . the grouping and selection of songs surely does not reflect the top hits of 1985-89.a far cry from the best of billboards efforts on previous years . for myself , a disappointment
