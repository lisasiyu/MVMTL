barry manilow ... real low ... ... ... how did this guy ever get a recording contract ? not only is his singing style shmaltzy , but his voice is grating , whiney , and nasally . besides being a self-admitted atheist and homosexual , he is a terrible singer . very handsome , though . he looks like a cross between a giant mosquito and a kangaroo who got into somebody 's eye shadow and makeup kits . what an overrated wierdo . this guy had to have friends inside the industry . manilow singing tony bennett or bobby darin is akin to cedric the entertainer playing cary grant or clark gable . in drag , no less
