good , but not nearly as good ... : ( it 's a good cd , but it 's not nearly as good as what solas has done so far . they came to portland a few weeks ago , but before i bought my tickets to the show i bought this cd . i listened to it , and was dissapointed . i decided to not go to the show , and i 'm a big irish music fan ! it 's too bad karen left the band , because she really had a charming voice and sytle , but i have to say this new lady ( i have n't even checked to see who she is ! ) is just not as much fun as karen . she can sing , that 's for sure , but so can a lot of people ! the band 's instrumental dance sets are more of the same , but i have to admit i 'm getting a bit tired of the guitarist 's chunky style . i did notice that the fiddler has got a bit wilder , which is great . overall , if you are a diehard solas fan , you 'd like to own this cd . if you 're a fan of good irish music , you probably wont listen to this cd more than a few times
