not worth the money ; not worth the time when i was vacationing in london this past may i spotted this new morcheeba cd at the store . i bought it and could n't wait to get it in the cd player . having only discovered this group a couple of years ago with the `` parts of the process '' compilation , i had fallen in love with the easy grooves and skye edwards talented , sultry voice . ( listen to `` the sea '' and then follow it up with `` undress me now '' and you 'll understand the magic in the range of her voice . ) imagine my extreme disappointment when i heard `` the antidote . '' skye is gone , replaced my a singer with a lower register and very little range . at times the new singer 's voice grated on my nerves so much , i had to move to the next track . the cd was a waste of money and the hour i took to listen to it is an hour i will never get back . news reports say the new singer is already gone and will be replaced , not by skye , but by yet another new girl . after the brillance of the pre- '' antidote '' library , i am forced to wonder : what were the guys thinking
