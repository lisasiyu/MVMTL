if you want to hear `` fiddle '' music do n't buy this ! this is a review for normal people . if you are a fan of standard fiddle do not buy this cd . it is a bunch of badly recorded , half hearted , boring and sloppy songs thrown together on an overpriced cd . save yourself $ ... or if you like this type of music just go buy some old little rascals episodes on dvd . then you will get the same music you hear on this plus the bonus of the little rascals . now i know why we think of blues guitar players not fiddle players when this music is discussed . the other reviewers seem to think some of the names on this cd will be familiar to you . do n't believe them , unless names like `` abrew 's portuguese instrumental trio '' or `` dixieland jug blowers '' are familiar to you . i am just hoping to prevent normal music lovers from stepping into this pile and losing $ ... like i did . i play banjo , fiddle , mandolin , dulcimer and guitar all badly , but i could get a gig with these bands and probably improve their sound . if you are the artsy type that digs this kind of stuff and you ca n't wait to grow a goatee , turn the lights down low , fill the room with smoke ( oops , bad for your health ) , put your sunglasses on and crank this baby up ; i hope you do n't mind being stuck by yourself all the time because no one else is going to put up with this lousy music . go find something with chubby wise in it if you want to hear some real fiddle playing . help support some little known , up and coming fiddle players that need to buy food and pay rent with royalty checks by buying their music instead of making these labels , that get this junky music for free or almost free , super rich
