for diehards only . let me start by putting out a couple of my biases before getting into this review -- first , i relaly do n't care for remixes as a rule , unless they 're dramatic and severely restructure a song , i generally find they add little . second , i really do n't care for `` the hand that feeds '' . having said that , the piece is presented in three mixes , the album version , the straight mix , and the dub mix . the album version has a catchy , circular guitar line and a straightahead drum beat that 's actually decent until the bridge with this bizarrely irritating spoken wordish section . just does n't work . the remix fares no better -- the straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious . if you 're a fan , get it . if not , skip this one , there 's good reasons it was n't released in the u.s
