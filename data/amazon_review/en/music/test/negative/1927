let 's forget this one happened while it 's not quite as horrid as the film of the same name , the who 's that girl ? soundtrack is still a rather wretched affair . due to madonna 's incredible popularity , this disc managed to hit the hot 200 's top ten and reach platinum status in sales , but it 's far from a must-own now . madonna contributes four tracks , and they all sound like true blue out-takes . madonna wrote the big hit `` who 's that girl ? '' ( # 1 pop , # 5 adult contemporary , # 44 dance ) with patrick leonard , and it 's a virtual rewrite of their own superior `` la isla bonita . '' the wistful ballad `` the look of love '' ( also co-written with leonard ) is less derivative , but much more ordinary . the frantic , steve bray-produced dance track `` causing a commotion '' ( # 2 pop , # 1 dance ) fares much better , and is an undervalued gem in madonna 's singles catalogue . the only other madonna cut ( the generic `` ca n't stop , '' also produced and co-written by bray ) is an obvious throwaway , yet it is still better than any of the other non-madonna tracks . the remaining cuts are by other `` artists '' ( i use that term loosely ) and are anonymous and unlistenable . there 's a reason why duncan faure and coati mundi never went anywhere .
