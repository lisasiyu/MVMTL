a modern minimalist disaster i sadly wasted approximately 2 hours of my life listening to this sorely lacking & quot ; opera & quot ; . i was not at all surprised to read in the notes that the score had never actually been written to the piece , but rather , monk came to the studio with a few ideas and improvised much of the work . the tracks repeat endlessly without any meaningful development . some of them contain nonsensical dialogue as well , which adds little to the opera 's overall effect . listen to the sample track & quot ; ice demons & quot ; for a good demonstration of ludicrous and pretentious composition . while i 'm not a devoted fan of minimalism in general , i can at least enjoy it on occassion . in my opinion , some minimalist works like & quot ; einstein on the beach & quot ; by philip glass are far more sophisticated than monk 's opera and do n't have the aggravating tendency to take themselves too seriously . monk 's overdramatic spiritual nonsense really gets on the nerves
