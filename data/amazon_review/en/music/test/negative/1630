falls flat i just saw gypsy and the well-known actress , patti lupone , playing and singing mama rose was superb . her voice was a miracle of covering all the emotional turmoil that is rose . she soared from sexy to demented to determined to clever . i came home and put on midler 's gypsy , and it sounded flat , stale , weary , unprofitable . i have always liked bette midler , but this cd seems to have no dynamic , no sparkle . i think that you need a true broadway diva to sing rose , and perhaps even one with some operatic experience . i can only fervantly pray that the ravinia festival will release a dvd or a cd of the lupone production . it may be unfair to compare roses . midler does excel in different material but i do n't think that she was able to find the turmoil that is madame rose and to sing it
