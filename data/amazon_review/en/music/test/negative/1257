a pathetic stab at mediocrity instead of buying the whole album , do yourself and your wallet a favor by only downloading only one song considering they all sound exactly the same . on the other hand , if you like talentless droning , lack of depth and variety which can only be compared to watching the landscapes change while driving through nebraska , then feel free to waste your money on this mockery of an album
