do you actually listen to music ? ? ? ? firstly , how many of the people that have bought this album heard a track or two on the radio ? maybe you saw him on tv ? maybe you bought it because it 's 'cool ' to like this kind of music at the moment ? that 's right , you probably listen to any kind of music ( no matter the quality ) that has been forced down your throat repeatedly . james blunt ( and many other mainstream acts ) represent what is wrong with the world today . most people do n't five a f**k about music when it comes down to it , and are quite happy to listen to what is paraded in front of them . i urge you ( if you 've read this far ) , to try and find music yourself . distance yourself from the media machine - you might just be suprised . as for this album : it 's completely derivative , with every element done 100 times better 30 thirty years ago . james blunt has a terrible voice - the comparisons to a cat being strangled mentioned elsewhere are accurate , although it sounds like the cat is also passing out razors . the songs are dull and predictable , the 'emotions ' having been well planned out in an a+r meeting at the record company . yet this album is extremely popular and acclaimed by many . a sad state of affairs indeed ...
