nauseatingly syrupy . the `` filler '' songs on this cd are some of the worst i 've ever heard . the lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character . i thought i was getting something similar to the unique , gritty sound of the cranberries , but alas , this is closer to hilary duff . aside from `` rebel heart '' ( which is one of my favorite songs ever ) , i can hardly tell they have any celtic connection at all !
