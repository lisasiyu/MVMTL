dual disc cd wo n't play in many cd players how idiotic . so far this cd only plays on my computer . i have 4 other cd players , one of which i bought one month ago and the cd will not play . on the back of the cd there is small print saying that `` the audio side does not conform to cd specifications and therefore will not play on some cd and dvd players '' . maybe amazon needs to make that very obvious in the writeup on the cd . i pay my money for the music legally and i ca n't listen to it . i am not likely to pay return shipping on it to amazon b/c it is n't worth the effort or money . i feel pretty ripped off . now i 'll have to copy it onto a cd to listen to it .
