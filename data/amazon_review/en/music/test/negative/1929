are you kidding ! i ca n't beleive the amount of good reviews of this cd . i have most of the pat metheny library and this cd is the worst by far . it was like listening to all of his un-inspired , not-as-good , filler songs in one sitting . yuck ! do n't get me wrong , i love pat metheny 's work , but this cd was just bad
