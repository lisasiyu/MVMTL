skip it and get a real muddy water or howlin ' wolf cd when i was buying this , i did not know much about muddy 's or wolf 's discography , and i did n't bother reading any reviews . in fact , i first thought it might be muddy 's own original cd called `` muddy and the wolf '' for some strange reason . it is n't . half of this cd is muddy waters , and the other half is howlin ' wolf . this is not a collaboration either . this is some of the material taken from muddy 's highly acclaimed fathers and sons cd and some of the material taken from wolf 's london sessions and basically glued together into one incomplete disc . if you think you want a *sample* of either man 's style , this is probably a bad place to start because it only represents muddy late in his career doing electrical blues and wolf in a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration with the british rockers in london . not a typical sample of each man 's career at all . i do own wolf 's london sessions and find them interesting material , but they are not by any means a true representation of the bluesman that wolf was . as for muddy , you 'd do much better just getting his fathers and sons cd . save your money here
