same old boring sound gets old two lesbians sing the same old tunes of music for the entire album ... ..your ear get so tired after all . typical japanese pop sound has always been like this . there is no kick to the tune , ... ..the only , and the best j-pop artist really impressed me was utada hikaru . she is better than most western singers . i bought this cd , listned it only once , and got rid of it . john lennon wan na bee not so original/creative `` artist '' .
