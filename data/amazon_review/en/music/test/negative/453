i agree - do n't buy it so i 'm not the only one who feels ripped off ! i was so angry when i played this ( on an excellent system and at a decent volume ) and discovered that many of the tracks are ( poor ) live recordings . like so many artists , he has passed his prime and his concert performances are but a pale imitation of the original recordings ; and it is those original recordings his fans remember and expect . i was so angry i was tempted to write to neil and complain . unlike one of your unhappy reviewers , i did not even have the benefit of a sticker warning of the live tracks . if you 're a real fan of the man , do n't buy it .
