disappointed as a long time beach boys fan who is in his 50 's , i was rooting for brian wilson to pull this off . unfortunately , this is a very mediocre album and in places really grates on me . my wife made me take it out of the player in the car . `` good vibrations '' and `` heroes and villains '' realize the potential of the 60 's versions and shine as the albums best cuts . most of the rest of the album is unlistenable . it is pet sounds progressing to the next level ( not a good thing ) and almost sounds like a pink floyd `` dark side of the moon '' wan na be , only 35 years too late , and not as listenable
