the worst of extreme you 'd think that after releasing 3 albums , these guys would have honed their craft . sadly , this album is their worst release . seems they tried to strip the sound back a bit on this album , fewer guitar overdubs being the obvious change . this album sounds a bit empty to me , i preferred the fuller sound of their earlier releases . the first 3 albums are great . being a fan of nuno bettencourt , i 'd also recommend the first mourning widows album ( the second one is not quite as good )
