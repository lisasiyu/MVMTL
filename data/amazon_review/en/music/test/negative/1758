only 1 reason to buy this : miracle legion ! one of the weaker entries in this hit-and-miss collection of new wave singles , there is only one legitimate reason to own this , but it 's a great reason : miracle legion 's & quot ; the backyard. & quot ; miracle legion was a mid-80 's college radio band which , like most of the college radio bands of the era , had that sort of post-byrds , post-vu moody guitar jangle sound ( i.e . r.e.m. , guadalcanal diary , reivers , connells , winter hours , etc. ) . not a great band , but this one song -- by far their best -- is unforgettable . an irresistable hook and some moving lyrics about growing out of boyhood make it one of those songs that , 15+ years later i can still sing from memory . it bears about as much relationship to & quot ; new wave & quot ; as , say , husker du , but , hey , what can you do . the rest of this disc ranges from the sort of lame radio hits my generation was forced to live with at the time ( & quot ; voices carry & quot ; ) to songs so bad that the mere thought of them still makes me wince ( & quot ; sunglasses at night & quot ; )
