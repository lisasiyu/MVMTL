my ears , oh no , my ears ! this presentation of mr. boone 's deserves a 1 for effort , a 5 for the best bad thing i 've ever heard . he made of mess of little richard 's `` tutti fruitti '' way back when . so , in keeping with such destruction , he went after our precious metal hits . funny stuff , though . i keep thinking of the those sad off the strip casino bands trying to entertain folks who just want a $ 1.99 breakfast and a win at the nickel machines .
