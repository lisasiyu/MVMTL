yorke should not go solo ever again if you are expecting a sound from thom yorke as good as the band he fronts , you will be disappointed . i do not believe this album is close to the quality of any radiohead album . t.yorke is too experimental with his solo debut . i am not impressed . `` the erasure '' has glimpses of the brilliance of 'kid a ' and 'amnesiac ' but does n't come close to matching either of radiohead 's most recent releases .
