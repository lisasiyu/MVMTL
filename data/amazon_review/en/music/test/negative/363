not a very good christmas album.. except for clay & kelly the whole album was really bad . the group did not harmonize well on the ensemble songs . tamyra screamed her way through silent night , a very mediocre version of silver bells , performed by kimberley locke and clay aiken . a boring i 'll be home for christmas , by idol wannabee , but charming , justin guarini had me falling asleep . and winter wonderland probably came close to being the worst on the album , but this christmas , sung by ruben studdard beat it . ruben 's charm has disapeared since the show . the vocal performance itself was horrible , but as was the song . what ever happened to traditional christmas ? i 'll have to wait for clay aiken 's christmas album to be released this october . but the highlights are have yourself a merry little christmas - a duet by tamyra gray and ruben studdard , the christmas song sung by kim locke , and , the best , the first noel , sung by clay aiken . think i 'm being biased towards clay ? by the album and see for yourself . and of course kelly was great . she tends to & quot ; scream & quot ; sometimes , but she did a good job on & quot ; oh holy night and my grown up christmas list - there are better versions then her out there , but kelly is really a great singer
