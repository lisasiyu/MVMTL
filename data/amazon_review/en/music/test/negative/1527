andrews sisters have better songs maybe it 's because i grew up listening to the andrews sisters , but i really had a hard time enjoying this disc . this is the second compilation of boswell sisters i 've tried , and again , they just do n't do it for me . this disc sounded like the andrews sisters before they found their magical blend and the tunes themselves were n't very good either . it 's not the boswell sisters fault , it 's just that the great song writers ( of the late thirties and early forties ) were just around the corner . in my opinion , it seemed that 99 % of the andrews songs were good , i felt that only a few on this disc were truly good . the arrangements were solid , but so were the vic schoen arrangements for the andrews sisters . sure , if there were no boswell sisters then there would probably be no andrews sisters , but i recommend the very best of the andrews sisters ( 40 greatest hits ) [ import ] first .
