you had to be there all the best songs are on other albums . this is an audio recording from multi-media presentations . much of the material is geared around visuals and anderson 's stage personnae . this is like listening to a television broadcast of a football game without the picture . you get the general idea what is going on , but you miss a lot . it is not like listening to a football game over the radio , where the broadcasters explain what you are n't seeing . without the visuals to go with this cd , many of the stories and jokes come up flat . this cd set is about 4 and a half hours long . it was taken from several years of anderson 's live shows that eventually became the united states . each cd more or less covers a specific `` tour '' . her back up band changes from cd to cd . you can tell that as time goes on , she gets more famous ( and maybe has more money ) she is able to add more to the shows ( and her backup band gets bigger ) . the sound quality is amazingly good . it is sharp and crystal clear . there is almost no audience noise , which does help create a good atmosphere for her stories . about 80 % of the material is spoken word . there is some music . it is probably less than 45 minutes of the total 4 and a half hour production . the recordings come from early in her career . she later redid most of the best material and put in on other albums . i would suggest getting her other cd 's . or if you want to see her performance art work , i would suggest searching out the home of the brave vhs tape ( i do n't think it has been released on dvd ) . do n't get the home of the brave cd
