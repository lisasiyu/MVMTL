yawn - why bother ? unlike volume 1 , which was great ( if incomplete ) , volume 2 always left me shaking my head . while it has serpentine fire ( which should have been on volume 1 ) and a few other hits , most of this album is filler ( fantasy again ? ) . what 's my point ? my point is that for a couple of bucks more you can get all of the original volume 1 , the good stuff off of volume 2 ( minus the filler ) , and get it all on one disc ( ewf 's greatest hits ) . i 'm just here to help you do the right thing
