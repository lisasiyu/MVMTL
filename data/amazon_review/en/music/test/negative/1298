misleading advertising to be sure , this album has some beautiful cuts . but that is overshadowed for me by the fact that while megastars bartoli and bocelli are featured so prominently on the cover , they only sing on 4 out of 16 tracks . this kind of misleading advertising is reprehensible . if i had n't purchased this while on vacation , i would have returned i
