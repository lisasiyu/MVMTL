you know exactly what you are going to get ... michael flatley 's feet fly like a racehorse , but he is really a one trick pony . now , if you like that one trick , you will like this ( and every other ) cd , and stageshow of his . if you are looking for something new , a progression of creativity , and expression , look elsewhere . when riverdance first appeared , i was a fan of the inovative blending of broadway , traditional irish step dancing , and new age mysticism . and the talent of all involved is undeniable . but after other troops appear imitating the idea , and doing so almost as well . you must wonder why this artist deserves the loyalty of consumers buying the same , repackaged material over and over again . darwin would say that those things that do n't evolve and adapt will become extinct . unfortunately , it appears to be a slow lumbering death , for the thundering feet of this dinosaur
