i was there when they recorded this ... i was at scullers when they recorded the live parts of this album . there were lots of great moments in that concert ... unfortunately , none of them made it onto the album . it 's like they took only the dull parts of the concert . the studio portions are n't much better . i 'm a huge fan of danilo perez and john patittucci but this album is really boring
