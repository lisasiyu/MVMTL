idea vs . execution 2 1/2 stars attempting another soundscape masterpiece , stratosphere has not aged so well . the music - simple , the production- dated , the performances- uninspired . there are attempts at greatness , hints of interesting fusions try to breathe a different life into the hollow art of looping . mostly though this is more akin to like acts such as jarre or kraftwerk then their more inspired material . whereas on an album like phaedra , the mechanics of their repetition somehow liberated , on stratosphere the mechanics enslave entire compositions into tight neat little boxes to look at , rather then truly feel . the self conscious songwriting further keeps the experience at bay , but if you concentrate more on the spaces in between the generically frustrating fast synth-bass-cheese , you might feel a few conceptual ideas worth the investment .
