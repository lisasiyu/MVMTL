una porqueria , in english that means ... . well , i read a few reviews , listened to the samples here on amazon , and bought the cd . my god ! awful isnt word enough to describe this . ok , the songs alone are ok , but when you listen to the whole cd , is when you realize that those guys doesnt know many chords , and that all the songs sound the same ( a few variations ) , and that the vocals are all the same , well , you have a patetic album . very weak , very boring , nothing new . they could do better , the lyrics are ok , but they need help , like , music lessons , even better , composition lessons . is really bad when all the songs in your album are identical . my fellow metalheads , rockers , whatever name you want , do not buy this , get a friend to loan it to you , then if you still want it , well , is your $ $ . but if you want real music , get death , or rush , hey , even green day is better option . in the end , high on fire should be left for begginers in the metal world of music .
