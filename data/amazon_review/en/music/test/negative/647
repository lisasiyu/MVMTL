nobody cares what school michael sullivan or `` tom '' went to first off , the atticus collections never feature great music ; with the exception of the occasional song . hate to break everyone 's hearts . this one in particular is chock fulla corny , sappy , pop-punk goodness . not that it 's not fun to listen to , but ( and like i said , with certain exceptions ) there 's nothing on here that you could n't see on mtv and make a mixtape out of . taking 15 bands , half of them sub-par , and putting together a collection of the only single ( if you can call it that ) off their latest lame album does n't make a quality recording . if you 're looking for something a bit more edgy , try picking up the complilations put together by the indie labels themselves of the best songs from their artists . because this is usually where you 're going to find stand-out tracks that you can really appreciate for the fact that you like it , not because blink-182 says they 're cool ( and no disrespect because i love blink too ) . that 's just my advice . to everyone who does really enjoy the music on here that 's cool too . i 'd still rather hear dragging the lake blaring out of someones car than the newest dj kay slay or funkmaster flex mixtape that 's for sure , or should i say , fo sho . and to the previous reviewer who commented that the worst track on the album is saosin 's bury your head ; if you had any musical taste beyond blink or mxpx because they 're `` frickin awesome '' you 'd know that anthony green is one of the most respected vocalists in the independant scene . saosin 's translating the name ep featuring green on vocals is held by many as one of the best independant debut eps of all time . if you want further proof , download the acoustic version of seven years and tell me if you can think of another emo-vocalist with anywhere near the same range . it 's always better to open your ears before you open your mouth .
