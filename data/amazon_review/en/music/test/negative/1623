no wonder he teamed up with billy joel for tours judging by both of their collections of `` hits '' , the two of them produced some of the most annoying tunes of the 70s & 80s , and unfortunately , beyond . these two `` pretend '' rockers hit the radio with junk like `` crocodile rock '' ( john ) and `` uptown girl '' ( joel ) , thus cementing their respective geek reputations . yuck ! neither elton john nor billy joel have made anything authentic ; they are both fake rock and rollers with repertoires filled with lame tunes , making them like the male equivalents of gloria estefan or madonna . yuck ! zero stars
