ying yang twins - me & my brother yea i agree , these are the artists that give hiphop a bad name , if you could even call these guys artists . this album is strictly made for clubs , and for bet and mtv watchers and mainstream listeners . this is radio music , and stuff you would hear in the clubs . thats all this music is good for . it has no creativity . the production on this album isnt bad , but lyrics , come on , you cant call these lyrics . i suggest you pass this album up unless your a mainstream listener . no top 5 for this album
