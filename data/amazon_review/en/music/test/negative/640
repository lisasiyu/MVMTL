dylan 's most overrated album i just do n't get why people like this album . it stinks . `` sara '' is dylan at his whiny worst . `` mozambique '' was the result of a drunken bet about how many words dylan could rhyme with mozambique . and the worst thing of all on the album is rivera 's screeching violin on every track . about her : dylan was riding in a limo and saw her walking on the street with a violin case . he liked the way she walked so he picked her up and promised to allow her to play on his album . and so it goes . `` bringin ' it all back home '' this ai n't . i am a huge dylan fan and have most of is catalogue , but this is the one album of his that i just ca n't stand . not one song works . if you are new to dylan , get `` bringin it all back home '' , `` highway 61 '' , `` blonde on blonde '' , and `` blood on the tracks '' . if you already have those , there are about 20 more to get before you bother with this one . oh , and one more thing : reuben carter was guilty
