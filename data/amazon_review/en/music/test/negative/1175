a big disappointment perhaps i was expecting too much , but i thought this set was a big letdown . in addition to the points brought up by some of the other reviewers ( missing tracks , songs out of sequence , etc . ) , i thought the sound quality was anything but excellent . i could see some of the recordings from the 30s sounding weak , but there is no excuse for those from the 40s and 50s sounding as poor as they do . i have a ton of 40s recordings and very few sound as bad as these do . hell , i have 78s that sound better . it 's a shame as i really like the sons of the pioneers , but for good quality cowboy recordings going to have to stick with riders in the sky until some one comes up with a better set than this
