old recordings rehashed into a new cd . very disappointing , it 's just old recordings rehashed onto a new cd and i heard that leann who is a wonderful singer did n't even have any say about this cd being released ! also there are n't enough patriotic songs ! i really hope that leann makes a new cd of all newly recorded patriotic songs and another one that is all inspirational gospel songs
