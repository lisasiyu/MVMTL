oh my god , it has taken patrick doyle ! by `` it '' i mean the evil monster called `` repetition '' . it may sound like a strange thing to say , but if you already own doyle 's `` harry potter and the goblet of fire '' , there 's absolutely no reason whatsoever to buy this soundtrack . the film feels like you 've seen it a thousand times already , and so does the score . i ca n't stress enough how much i dislike the habit of many composers to develop a specific sound and a certain set of themes and motifs , and ride them out until the end of days . that being said , it 's not a big reach saying that goblet of fire and eragon sound exactly the same . and they do . the orchestrations could n't be more identical , and the theme is the same , even if doyle adds a few flourishes . it may fit the film somehow , but if you forget that for a second and evaluate the music as an entry in the long history book of film music , or even in the not-so-long book of the last few years , or worse , as a standalone piece , it 's just a horrible product , it 's patrick doyle on autopilot . and even if it does fit the film , there 's more to a great film score than capturing a scene reasonably well . a great film score gives the film a unique feeling , and eragon does n't do that . instead of writing an `` eragon '' score , doyle churned out a patrick doyle score . sound crazy , but that 's the big difference between good film composers and great film composers . and contrary to the opinion of many , doyle is merely a good composer , and so we get a doyle score with eragon fingerprints instead of eragon music with patrick doyle fingerprints .
