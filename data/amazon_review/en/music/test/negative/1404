pleeze , pleeze , pleeze i do n't know what happened but this album needs to be slept on . this dude keeps rappin ' about where he 's from and junk like that . it 's like he does n't have anything else to say . while the production may be okay ( it 's questionable ) the lyrics just plain suck . hey fiend give dr. dre a call
