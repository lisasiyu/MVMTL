a sad ending for eagles i picked this album up , expecting the same level of quality as past eagles albums ( such as the thrilling desperado ) , however , it seems the only quality songs on this album are the hits , which can be just as easily obtained by purchasing the hits volume ii , a much better album . the rest of the album is lame and uninspired , and is ultimately not worth your money
