sorry ... not one of dl & q 's best i really enjoy doyle lawson and quicksilver , especially their gospel music . this is their first release for rounder records . i suspect the content and flow of this album represents a strong influence by the record company and not the usual freedom which doyle lawson has had in the past to pick the song lineup . perhaps they were just trying to `` break the mold '' so to speak and stay away from heavy gospel content . i 'm not sure where that came from , but to me it causes this release to come across as forced and mechanical rather than natural and flowing . do n't get me wrong , the musicianship and especially the vocals are top notch , but for me this does not make up for the material selected for this release . go back and listen to some of the soulful and sincere music from their previous releases and then compare it to this album . i will be going back to listen to rock my soul and the older dl & q material and you got ta dig a little deeper will probably be a very infrequent visitor in my cd player . if this is how dl & q is going to be with rounder , then in my opinion we would all have been better off without that relationship . - scripto
