incorrect interpretation of lyrics regarding the review of wesley horton ( edmond , ok ) on 20 january 2005 , i agree with his assertion that the subject of the song was a plane crash , not a car crash . however , part of his argument for that is based on the following lyrics ; then i looked straight at the attendant ; his face is pale as it can be he bends and whispers something softly he says there 's no chance for me . i think he is assuming that the attendant is a male flight attendant , which would lend support to his claim that the song is about a plane crash . at that time , however , flight attendants 1 ) were almost exclusively female , and 2 ) were referred to as `` stewardesses , '' not `` flight attendants . '' ( the term `` flight attendant '' did not come into use until years after the song was written . ) i think the attendant referred to in the song is likely an *ambulance* attendant ( in the days before `` e.m.t . 's , '' etc . ) encountered after the crash . i agree with his assertion , but i think the support for it is based upon a faulty interpretation of the term `` attendant '' in this section of the lyrics
