he 's not quite there yet ... apart from some reasonable songs ( one wish - track 4 , war is over track 8 ) , i really did n't feel like this album was all there . to be honest i have n't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight i would n't have bought this cd . his talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted !
