new , but bland do n't get me wrong - it is wonderful to have a chorus line back on broadway . it is also wonderful to have this new recording , which is essentially the entire score . it be nice if `` and ... '' could have made the cut , but the money hungry producers should n't be expected to include that . ( yes , that was sarcasm ) . the current revival is a wonderful evening in the theatre - but what makes it so wonderful is only part of what made it so wonderful the first time around . michael bennett 's choreography and direction are brilliant , and they alone are worth the price of admission . when the show fails , it fails because of the cast . unfortunately , most of the flaws have been captured on this recording . some of the orchestrations are bland and sound `` canned '' ( just as it does in the theatre . ) the opening number plays at a deathly pace . charlotte d'amboise ca n't sing . it just does n't work . get it if you 're a collector , but if you 're not - save your money . get the original
