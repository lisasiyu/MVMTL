fresh fruit for rotting vegetables is all you really need by dk maybe frankencrist if you really enjoy fresh fruit ... .this is a very annoying and bad b-sides album ... california uber alles and holiday in cambodia are over-produced and watered down ... and where is the killer intro to holiday in cambodia ? yeah i like jello biafra 's voice and his mixture of funny and scary themes hit the spot , but this album consists of b-sides for a reason ... aka they werent good enough to go on anything else
