not as hardcore as it should/could be . being a huge gatecrasher and cream fan for quite some time , i was excited about this new release . well after alot of anticipation for it 's arrival , i am a little disappointed . it really does n't have the hardcore feel of previous releases . it is n't bad ... .but it it is n't great . it is not because of the choice of tracks that is to blame , just the choice of remixes . many friends have listened to this compilation also , and share similar opinions . want something better ? choose an gatecrasher compilation from 2002 - 2005 ... .you 'll love it
