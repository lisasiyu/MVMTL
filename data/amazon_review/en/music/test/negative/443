get over yourself , fat boy just who wants to hear van morrison complain like an old ninny about the press , or the pitfalls of being a godlike , mythical celebrity trapped by his own legend and fame -- and all of it contained in bland rocking-chair muzak jazz . three chords and some bad lyrics and right away they come on with a messiah complex . ( you fans and your empty lives are partly to blame for all this . ) `` i just want to sing my songs , '' he whines . ( who 's stopping you ? ) john waters once said : if you want to be left alone , pick up a monkey wrench and fix toilets and stay out of show business . besides , i did n't know van the man was all that famous . does anyone under 50 know who he is ? i sure have n't seen any articles in the paper about him lately . old hippies might still babble about `` into the mystic '' and his performance in `` the last waltz . '' i heard him sing `` gloria '' on an oldies station the other day and i went straight for rush limbaugh . are the royals in england so desexed these days that the daily sun has to write up van morrison to this degree of musical paranoia ?
