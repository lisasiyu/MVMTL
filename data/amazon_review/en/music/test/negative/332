if your heart beats more than once an hour , do n't buy this album ! first , i should remind you , dear reader , that since italics , boldface type , and underlines ca n't be used in these kind of reviews , i have to use one capital letter in some mid-sentence words to slightly stress them and use all capitals to stress other words even more ! anyway , one star on this review is one star too many to give this album and band . i received this album as a gift for my birthday while i was on the other side of the country . i 'd never even heard of this band until then , much less any of their songs by pure and simple osmosis . when i finally got around to taking it out of the wrapping and putting it into the cd player of my car on the way to work and back , i was not impressed with the opening song , nor the second , nor the third , etcetera , and so on , and so forth ... i kept wondering if this coma-inducing drone ( interrupted only by the screaming of the word `` nothing '' at least 20 times at the end of the first song ) was some kind of tactical build-up by the band so they could eventually break out a song that made them at least somewhat big ( much less a hit ) to start the party . you know the kind of song i mean , do n't you , dear reader ? i mean the kind of song that makes you think `` whoa ! who 's this ? ! '' because it has a either a great opening , or a great first line or four , or at least something to grab your attention within the first minute , like ani difranco 's song `` out of range '' would do in less than 16 seconds . anyway , many extremely torturous minutes later , the 9th song came along ( ironically for me , it 's called `` wishful thinking '' ) and i honestly could n't take anymore of this drivel ! i gave this band a whole nine tries to make something that at least resembles an impression and all i got was only slightly less musical boredom as when i did when i once tried to listen to the only bad album i currently know by tangerine dream : `` zeit '' . that album , by the way , was basically four 20-minute bits of what seemed like people in an orchestra tuning up their instruments and eventually matching one single note with each other before the conductor starts a symphony you never get to hear . as i said , this album is only a micrometer less boring . i honestly can not understand how anyone who scouts for the music industry could have happened along this sorry excuse for a band and thought to themselves `` wow ! these guys are on fire ! i must get them to the studio and p.r . them immediately ! ! '' let me put it this way , dear reader : remember that song `` next time i fall in love '' by peter cetera and amy grant back in the mid to late 1980 's ? in comparison to the so-called songs on this album , that cutesy ballad will sound more intense and energetic than `` paranoid '' by black sabbath . maybe wilco got their record contract by winning a contest of who could bore an audience the quickest . oh , and if you 're wondering to yourself , `` oh yeah ? well , let 's see this guy ( as in me ) make a better album ! '' i already have made a better album and i 'll gladly show it to you . leave me a response to this review if you want that proof . aaaaaannnnnd ... cut ! that 's a wrap
