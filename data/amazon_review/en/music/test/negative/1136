superb collection - unbearable sound quality much has been made here about the remixes on this collection . the truth is that the audio problems go far beyond the remixed titles . the whole of the 2nd disc is a washed out , muddy audio mess and it is inconceivable that someone at sony/columbia did n't catch it before release . this compilation is about 15 years overdue for a serious remaster . some of the titles here can be heard in far better quality on the sundazed releases , however admittedly a few of those have some excessive overmodulation issues . they are still by far the lesser of two evils . at least the songs punch the way the raiders need to punch . as is , the `` legend '' cd sits on my shelf gathering many years worth of dust . it 's far to painful to listen to
