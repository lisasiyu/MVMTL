heartbroken more like it ... a patched up free attempts to carry on as normal , but the chemistry is just not there - fraser is gone and tetsu struggles / does n't even try to make the most of the opportunity given to him . rather than contribute some great bass ideas , he is content just to plod along ; kossoff plays on 5 of the 8 tracks . gone is the heart wrenching melody and beautiful vibrato of his playing . he 's running on remote control . it sounds like he 's slumped in the corner of the studio stoned out of his head ; bundrick writes 2 tracks / shares the credits on two others . his work sounds like album filler put there to satisfy the band 's contractual requirements . the whole album is lazarus with a triple bypass . the only standout track is the excellent 'wishing well ' ... the other songs are just musical ideas i.e verse and chorus cobbled into a finished song ... another album to buy if you ca n't stand blank spaces in your free cd collection ... what a tragic waste ...
