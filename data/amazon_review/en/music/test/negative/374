a very deceptive `` greatest '' hits for whitney whitney houston is a nice-looking woman , has a beautiful voice , a good selection of songs ... why her producers have issued this crappy edition of her `` greatest '' hits ? ? ? ... the first disc is ok , almost all of her best romantic hits ( `` did n't we almost have it all '' and `` saving all my love for you '' plus the main theme for `` the bodyguard '' originally from dolly parton ) are included . the second disc however , is purely another attempt to promote these modern ( and weird ) djs that `` mix '' dancing themes , whose original versions are far better than the mixed versions !
