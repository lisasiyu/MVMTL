the sound of one band aging i have been so underwhelmed by this tepid album since it came out , but i thought i 'd give it a little time to do a little aural sneak-attack and start to `` grow on me '' . no such luck . this release is so thoroughly forgettable that after the few times i 've listened to it , paying strict attention and trying hard to feel something ( in a feeble attempt to assuage my self-inflicted guilt for shelling out hard-earned dough for this ... ummm ... .music ) , i ca n't say i remember a single passage or sentence from this bland offering . and what i 'm comparing it to is the sheer brilliance of previous recordings , emotionally supercharged songs like `` carry the zero '' or `` kicked it in the sun '' that really affected me profoundly the first coupla times i heard them and have stuck with me for years . all i can sense here is the grayness of a group of musicians who do n't even really have the energy ( or sense ) to coast on the punch their early outings conjured up so deftly . even the obligatory neil young ( a true creaky old dude if their ever was one ) noodling is so embarrassingly derivative and uninspired you just wan na pat these guys on their sweatered backs and guide them to a comfy chair . i 'm giving this one a one star not in comparison with other bands but compared to what built to spill used to be capable of . maybe it 's the fame , maybe it 's the fortune , but this is a band that has truly lost its teeth . pray god they score some dentures before they muster the energy to inflict more sonic gummings on their hapless fanbase ... ..
