cheesy , corny gothic- wan na be midnight syndicate wants to be a lot , i guess . it wants to be dark and scary , but they 're more like a graphic vampie novel , you can admire the technique but you do n't really get involved . the images they produce remain a bit plastic , static , with an overdose of well-known themes . twenty one short tracks , too short really , are offered here , with a not-all-to-believable-and-scary voice talking : `` born of the night , they lurk in the shadows ... gargoyles of living stone , lost souls who wander mist shrouded cemetaries , and vampires who dwell deep within forbidden crypts ... creatures of the night , they arise as darkness descends ... '' can lines about things that hide in the dark be even more cheesy ? then some strings are touched like guiter wires and this sounds rather good . a heavy churchbell starts humming , dark but single layered ambient creeps in . but it 's all still too obvious , and more and more i get the feeling this is some sort of `` starters kit for gothic fans '' . you want effective , deeply seeded dark ambient that really knocks the light out of you , try `` within the depths of silence & phormations '' by raison d'etre or any of lustmord 's solo albums `` heresy '' or `` the place where the black stars hang '' . but of course , giants in the dark ambient world like lustmord or raison d'etre do n't really mess with vampires and gargoyles and bombastic electronic sounding choirpulp . and because of this , there will still be an audience for an act like midnight syndicate . i just hope that m.s . will evolve more , make less tracks , and the ones they do make , should be stretched out more , giving them a chance to get more layered and filled with more depth than they are now . track three , the title track , offers a truely menacing piano tune , but because the composers do n't seem to know what to do with it , they just keep on repeating it . and after a short three minutes the track is over . and `` corny humming number four '' starts . so what ?
