a charlie brown schmalzfest as others have noted , the & quot ; charlie brown suite & quot ; is a ponderous , overblown arrangement of charlie brown tunes accompanied by orchestra and with little improvisation . noises from the audience ( squeaking chairs , etc . ) are clearly audible during the quieter moments of the suite . according to the liner notes , guaraldi 's son has uncovered a lot of unissued material on reel-to-reel and other formats . the selections here are from the collection of pianist george winston , a guaraldi fan . i hope the remaining material , which he hopes to issue in the future , is better than this . the three tracks aside from the suite are more interesting ; however , if you 're looking for peanuts music , you 'd be much better off sticking with the three other guaraldi charlie brown cds currently available
