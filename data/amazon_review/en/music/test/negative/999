good for those with low standards ... i originally became interested in into eternity when i saw them open for stratovarius during the 2005 monster metal madness north american tour . even though they were n't the reason i was there in the first place , i though they gave a pretty good performance and i decided to look into their music . unfortunately , after listening to this album , i 'm reminded that first impressions are not always accurate . first of all , i about laughed myself to death at album description under editorial reviews that states this album is `` a must for fans of dream theater , iron maiden ... and nevermore ... . '' . this band has absolutely nothing to do with these bands or the music they play ( other than the fact into eternity probably wishes they were as good as these aforementioned bands that are light years beyond their skills ) , and is obviously slapped here as a selling point . then again , i somewhat ca n't blame century media for writting such rubbish , considering sonata arctica and nightwish have left the label for nuclear blast ( leaving firewind , dream evil and royal hunt as the label 's sole acts i care about ) . also , calling this is cd progressive is a joke as well . the album 's only redeeming feature is the main singer ( no , not mr. death growl # 1 and # 2 ) . unfortunately , the fact he is forced to take turns with the two death growl vocalists and we never get to hear his full range or abilities as they sing songs with lyrics that are so predictable to this kind of music you swear some depressed teenager wrote when he forgot to take his anti-depressants . i 'm not saying you can write about death , disease , and everything and anything having to do with moral decay , but you have to make it interesting at least and add some intricate song structure ! that said , the only songs on the album worth listening to are buried in oblivion and black sea of agony , were the death vocalists take enough of back seat to the main vocalist and spare the listener of their sad attempt of sounding cool . in all honesty , i would n't recommend this album to anyone , because i can think of so many other bands and albums worthy of metal fans attention and hard earned dollars . ok , so maybe i 'm being a little harsh considering these guys are exactly `` superstars '' per say , but i think i 've been pretty nice so far , as i did n't complain about the production quality or the drummer 's stupid habit of banging on the same drum for 15 straight seconds and calling it music . oh wait , i did complain , whoops ...
