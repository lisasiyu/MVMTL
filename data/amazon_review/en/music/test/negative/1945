a g-unit breakdown if you 're looking for good aftermath-produced or g-unit affiliated music , here 's which artists to go to and which to stay far , far away from : 50 cent -- go nowhere near the massacre . you 're 5 % more likely to suffer a slow , painful death just by touching the case . it is the worst cd you could possibly ever hear . same thing goes with the movie soundtrack . get rich or die tryin ( the original ) on the other hand , is solid ... especially on those bonus tracks ( heaven , life on the line , u not like me ) , patiently waiting , 21 questions , and anything featuring another g-unit member . pimp , with its lack of snoop dogg ( which the music video seemed to promise ) , high all the time , many men , and wanksta can kind of get old though . the thing about 50 cent these days is that by himself he is no longer any good at all . he needs to be held up by a crutch of some better rapper before he can make good with his own rap . the reason he succeeds so well in his collaborations with the game in the documentary and eminem in the re-up is because he has actually good rappers holding him up . he 's like the abbott of the comedians abbott & costello now . he has nothing worth contributing without his costello of some kind to be there for him . the game -- as soon as i heard this guy 's album and compared it to 50 's massacre , i knew that if g-unit was going anywhere , this guy would be the one to take it there . and now it turns out he left . ca n't blame him when the clique-label 's leader is so dumb . was the most progressive rapper of the crew , and his reason for leaving is probably because of how anti-progressive 50 's massacre was . has the best , deepest subject matter within his songs , if not the best flow ( although his underground 300 bars song would automatically crown him king if he did that well all the time on his main albums ) . as far as the mainstream and not underground cds go though , i 'd give him a 2nd best for flow of the g-unit crew . his documentary album has been called the third chronic , and has the best of dre 's beats you 'll find on any g-unit cd . criticisms are that he name-drops dre & nwa a bit too much , but overall , i think it 's not that big of a deal . he 's a big hip-hop history fan , and he 's still a little starstruck over the chance of being able to work with dre . given a very brief profile of the rapper , he fits into an uncomfartable stereotype , ( average-looking rapper from compton who 's been shot a few times ) , but he immediately carves a personality of his own in the doctor 's advocate and his even better the documentary . young buck -- i 'd say probably the best g-unit member still in g-unit . this guy has the best flow , as far as mainstream cds are concerned . he also seems to be the 2nd-most concerned about the world ( a.k.a . 'progressive ' ) , with references to the illuminati amongst other secret organizations . i like this guy the best of the remaining g-unit . 2nd best comes sort of close to him , but still does n't match buck 's raw skills . lloyd banks -- this guy is second best . his flow skills somewhat tie for 2nd place with the game 's , or at least land in that area . he , buck , and the game are my top three for g-unit ( even though the game 's not g-unit anymore ) . anybody else you can probably pass up . i 'll go over them real quick just to make sure you know who the others are beforehand . tony yayo -- the one male member who is worse than 50 cent . in the g-unit cd , they always shouted 'free yayo ! ' and now he is free . the g-unit had done a terrible thing by campaigning for his release . his is of no benefit whatsoever to them . he might even be responsible for the gradual dumbening of 50 's style & outlook on life . joe -- the kind of r & b star you 'd expect to sing chorus or backup on an outkast track , mixed with a bit of r. kelley and a very small splash of stevie w. he 's not bad i guess . i hated him completely on ' wan na get to know you ' of the g-unit cd , but would definitely still listen to his 'ride wit u ' track off his own solo album . olivia -- pssh , are you dumb ? no . she 's partially responsible for candy shop . that should be reason enough to hate her full-on and never turn back . she kind of ca n't sing either . bad move to make an r & b cd without being able to sing , i think . lil ' scrappy -- this is the same lil ' scrappy you heard on lil ' jon 's `` what u gon do ? '' track . he 's pretty good . decent at least . definitely not as decent as 50 cent 's original get rich or die tryin , but decent . he 's got a good enough style though that places him above everyone else still in g-unit , excluding lloyd banks and young buck , but including 50 cent by himself . i think that 's everybody . so ... now you know all about g-unit , and who 's good and who 's not . if you have to buy g-unit , now you know who to avoid and who to embrace . if you plan on buying the original get rich or die tryin , i suggest you do n't . burn it , or have a friend burn it for you . 50 does n't need the money right now or ever again . if you decide not to buy g-unit , then more power to you . the game is actually now sort of the anti-g-unit since he left , because , you know , the majority of their members still suck . i 'd suggest mos def 's black on both sides instead of any of this stuff though ... even if you were planning on buying g-unit . that 's probably the best hip-hop album i 've ever heard , or will hear
