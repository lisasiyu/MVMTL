what is this ? we all have different taste and i am trying to consider this . but to me this is just another artist who had a strange idea and we are bying it and help him to live a good life . nickelodeon and even the disney channel featuring him . my little girl and i listened to two songs that they played on the disney channel over and over.malti is the song she really started to listen to . honestly . the only reason why that song is so great is barbara 's voice and singing ability . dave ca n't sing and should n't even try to sing in spanish . the tune is catchy and we find us humming along . so i ordered this cd . what a joke . most of the time you ca n't evne understand what he is saying and it is not as if he came up with new songs . he has the known children songs for the most part and just puts his own twist on it . but it is not entertaining for little ones.my daughter keeps asking : what is this ? till malti comes on and then she and i are relieved and hum along with joy and glee . thank you barbara for saving this song . i even bought another cd thinking perhaps i just got a bad one and the next are better . i am disappointed with that one as well . so you take a song like somewhere over the rainbow and put a new rythm on it . wopee . i like it but it is n't worth it to me and i admit i have no idea or clue who this artist is and where he came from and what his background is but honestly.. he is overrated and sold . there is a song with cheryl crow on it . okay . so i am thinking this will be fun perhaps . only to find that i want to shake him and her for again not putting some fun and step and pep into a song . i guess i am not a alternative and do n't appreciate the earthy balance the musicians bring to the music . i want some rythm and clap your hands together and sing along type of music for my children . this type of stuff is something a teenager can appreicate later on only that the songs are too young for them at that time . my children have no clue what this is about and ca n't figure it out . and we listen to everything from disney to classic , to broadway . you name it . so we are not just sesame street cd lovers . but this music is a joke . no talent . one tone of voice and as if he forgets to open his teeth while singing . barbar saves this cd but what a waste of money for one song . don '' t buy it . and all these people who fall for it.. grrrr . it is like a art gallerie . everyone stands in front of the picture that shows a green dot . and they come up with tons of explanations what it may be and how fantastic the artist is . and in reality he is sitting back and chuckling because he just ran short of a painting and spilled his paint brush while cleaning it . give me a break . shame on disney and nickelodeon to fall into this as well . and taking out great singers and shorten real talents opportunity . wow , guess you can tell i am not into it . ; 0 ( explore , again.. everyone has different taste . but i just do n't get it , nor like it . i find it horrible .
