career suicide eight long years after this album was released and i figure i might as well write a review . i know what people say , that , it was n't the downward spiral 2 . well , i was hoping for something equally as impressive as the downward spiral , not the same . i realize bands move on , grow up , get old , but , such a contrast . the downward spiral , and previous works , were a progressive movement towards something.. something . the fragile may have been that something . the world will never know . i wonder ... who will hold the chalice next ? blame it on fear , blame it on drugs , blame it on pressure , blame it on whatever , but , this album is the ultimate opportunity lost . successive works , such as `` with teeth '' , are just flat out laughable . was nine inch nails ever a great band ? i have my doubts ... yet , i can still remember being dumbstruck by the glory of mr. self destruct that first time ... as far as i 'm concerned , this album was trent 's fall from godhood . this album has no purpose , no progression . it 's a mess of half committed tracks and trivial ambience . there is no plot , no experience . while downward spiral was a journey to something divine , this album , however , lacks any magic whatsoever . this album will not change you . oh , nin will still be around , perhaps for ten more years , perhaps even twenty . but , that spirit , that anger , that power which is found in the downward spiral and broken will never show itself again . the sincerity is but a fading memory , and to those just discovering nin , will never be felt . all in all , i would rather have never been born than live in a post fragile world . it was that disapointing to me , and still is . one star for destroying one of the only joys of my childhood
