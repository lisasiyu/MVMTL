reality check i have a fairly extensive collection of comedy albums , and i gatta say this is probably one of the lamest i 've ever heard . if you enjoy hearing a one-line joke dragged out to 5-6 minutes ( like the worst episodes of snl ) , then maybe this is tolerable . maybe once . the people giving this high ratings are either norm 's friends or people too young to have experienced true wit . trust me , if you listen to this once you will probably never play it agai
