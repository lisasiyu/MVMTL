got ta be honest i 've been a bone fan for 12 years and bizzy 's first 3 solos are classics in my opinion . however , all of the fears that speaking in tongues brought to my mind were confirmed by this release . i still think that bizzy 's a uniquely talented and spiritual man , but he seems to have surrounded himself with wack producers and low expectations . the repetative hooks and sparse verses are particularly disappointing
