i guess one would call this soft cheese . with the exception of a few of their more recent live albums , i have just about everything sci has put out . i became a fan only relatively recently , but once i got one ( starting with their collaboration with kellar williams ) , i got hooked and ca n't stop . but this album left me disappointed . it was slow and stripped down . as several have said before me , none of the jams , none of the joy , none of the humor , nor the can't-stop-moving musicality of basically every other release by these guys , whether live or in the studio . everything else - anything else- they 've done is just better . buy if you want to have a complete collection of their work , but if you 're a first-time buyer , do n't go here , because it 's not representative of just how fantastic they are . had this been the first album i got from them , i would not have bought more and would 've missed the unbelievable experience i have every time i listen to virtually everything else they 've done .
