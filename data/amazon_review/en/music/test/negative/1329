undeserving of praise my inability to see what 's so great about this album does not stem from my lack of experience with `` experimental '' or `` electronic '' music . nor does it reflect my feeling about bands that change their sound on every album . the problem with this album is that it lacks what ulver are ordinarily pretty good at . when they explored the folky territory of kveldssanger , the raw black metal of nattens madrigal , and even the ambitious and remarkably diverse william blake album , they slipped more effortlessly into the style . a few `` soundscape '' albums , and a couple more blippy ep 's later , they come up with this mess . and i say mess , because that 's really what it sounds like to me . it 's as though they wanted to hang onto some of the elements of `` quick fix for melancholy '' but incorporate the experimental weirdness of label mate when ( yes , that 's the name of the band : when ) , almost to a worshipful extent at times . unfortunately the result is n't nearly as brilliant , in my opinion , to the aforementioned solo project . rather it sounds like a bit of a monstrosity that 's been shined up a bit by garm 's silky crooning ( the silkiness of which gets on my nerves after a short while ) . of course , this is my opinion . i do n't ordinarily find it necessary to write bad reviews like this , but when i see something like this that is n't really all that unique or amazing get a lot of praise , it rubs me the wrong way .
