lame and embarassing well i am a bit jaded because i live in a city where everybody talks and looks like larry the cable guy . if the people here do n't resemble him then they resemble ned flanders from the simpsons . so i get to put up with both extremes in real life . why would anybody want to pay for this load of nonsense unless you are from a real sophisticated state or city and this to you is hilarious because you are laughing at how lame this obese comedian is . the blue collar tv show was mildly funny . this cd on the other hand is not funny . it is n't even crude or offensive . this humor is childish and bad and possibly young kids would think it was funny for a week but most adults would n't buy into this stuff for a minute .
