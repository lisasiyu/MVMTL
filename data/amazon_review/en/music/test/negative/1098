where to begin ... the `` stick to fallout boy '' -esque comments are just silly . if you want to listen to noise for nearly an hour go ahead . this is one of the worst lps ever recorded . all i could think of when listening to this cd was a hilarious wiki page mocking a fictional industrial band from finland , who hide behind fire hydrants and record the sound of dogs urinating , among other things that do n't belong in a review . but then i guess i 'm just too much of a pea brain to appreciate the depth of this follow-up . please . get over yourselves . i hated the debut when i first listened to it , but it is near the top of my favorite albums of the decade now . the difference ? the debut was music ! the irony ( ironidence ) here is not in the music itself , but that the album is a perfect reflection of the band - which is no band at all . when your lead singer broods in a corner all day and does n't even speak to the rest of the band , it should come as no surprise that they record an album that sounds exactly like three year-olds on a play date - or an industrial band
