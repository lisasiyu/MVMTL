boy is he faithful ! i remember when saturday night live did a spoof of irene cara from fame singing the theme song from the movie as `` same : '' `` same ! i sing the same song forever . '' maybe peter should have gone that route instead of this album . i just got through listening to it , and have decided he should never have left chicago . sure , it 's a nice , slick adult contemporary recording , but it 's also the same exact song with different lyrics eleven times in a row . sometimes he duets with two females who sound exactly alike -- crystal bernard ( hee-hee-hee , gimmie a break ! ) and ronna reeves , whose unique vocal style even manages to get the authenticity sucked out of it here . even his remake of the beautiful `` happy man '' from his chicago days is reduced to an extremely unattractive entrail of itself . so why 2 stars instead of one ? production quality is key here , and it 's nice wallpaper music for wallpapering by . beside that , it 's peter , and at least his voice is good . other than that , this is a lackluster piece of offal that i wasted under ten bucks on . my second and last solo cetera album , i suggest you steer clear of this album unless you find 11 versions of one song entertaining .
