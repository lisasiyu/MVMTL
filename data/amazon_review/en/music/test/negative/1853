great music ... but buggy macromedia `` special features '' the music makes the cd worth getting ; however , the so-called special features ( i.e. , worthless advertising ) can ruin your ability to enjoy the music on a computer system . for example , on my computer 's cd/dvd player , the buggy software part of the disc makes the music unplayable . on a different drive ( a cd/rw ) , the music portion of the disc can be played ; however , at times their annoying macromedia advertising interface will pop up , sometimes multiple simultaneous copies , stopping the music . and if you kill the advertising `` stubs , '' you can be left with the side effect of an annoying beep whenever you move the mouse pointer over a web link . please put more tracks of music on cds -- complete score and songs -- but leave off the bogus `` special '' features ! ( and for that matter , i do n't appreciate the cutesy attempt on other cds to `` hide '' extra music tracks by putting minutes of silence before final tracks . this is especially bad on multi-disc players where you do n't want long periods of silence -- at least not until all discs have been played .
