a disappointing album from a great band to preface : i am a longtime fan of inxs and own everything from listen like thieves to elegantly wasted . elegantly wasted is , in my opinion , almost worse than full moon , dirty hearts . actually , i will definitively say it is worse . there are the gems show me ( cherry baby ) and elegantly wasted , the title track , but the album quickly runs out of gas , runs together , and seems uniformly tepid , like lukewarm water . it does n't rock the way inxs usually rocks . it attempts to experiment like some of the earlier projects successfully did , only unsuccessfully . there are n't the hooks or the tunes to redeem it . this is disappointing because i am a fan and i want to give the band an open ear and not condemn their work . but this album , unfortunately , stinks . if you 've ever seen inxs ' live baby live concert or listened to any album from 1985 's listen like thieves to 1992 's welcome to wherever you are , you probably concur that inxs was ( and is , thanks to their newfound popularity with the rockstar inxs tv show ) a band capable of a great sound and a load of great songs . for instance , the entire playlist around 1991 was one great song after another . it was the pinnacle of the band 's career . michael 's stage performance oozed with charisma and sexiness , andrew 's ( and michael 's ) songwriting was top notch , the band 's arrangements were tight and good . and then something happened . fan reaction to x was much more tepid than to kick , although x still sold fairly well . the band embarked on a successful tour . around this time , grunge became huge in the global musical consciousness , and by the time of welcome to wherever you are in 1992 , the inxs sound was out-of-style . but ironically , that album contains some of the band 's most diverse , greatest work . inxs is releasing a new album soon with their new lead singer , j.d . i hope , and am confident , that it will be a return to greatness for the band . i believe that they can still crank out bitchin ' tunes once again
