parallel universe ? people who listen to the goldberg variations on piano must live in a parallel universe . liquid legato ? three minutes of passion ? there is no other set of variations of any era for any instrument more `` structurally '' conceived and unified than the goldbergs ! it 's all or nothing , not a string of pearls . please , please , listen to the harpsichord performances of trevor pinnock or bob van asperen before you spend money on another pianist 's misconception . ms tureck 's performance , by the way , is particularly inchoate . if you must have piano , try richard goode
