fun in small doses afi 's debut album is a great deal different from their last few cds . there is no traces of goth or pop punk here , just straight up old school punk with some truly hilarious lyrics . the problem with this album is it 's all the same , there 's almost no variation , so it 's good when you listen to just a few tracks ( all of which are good ) but put back to back it 's impossible to get through the entire cd without a headache . the two standout tracks for me are `` high school football hero '' and the classic `` i want a mohawk but my mom wo n't let me get one '' . the music reminds me alot of mxpx 's debut cd `` pokinatcha '' , but the lyrics are alot more similar to the offspring . definitely a good cd if you wan na see where the band started and you 're already a fan , but if you 're new to afi and want to backtrack from sing the sorrow or decemberunderground i recomend either black sails in the sunset or the all hallows ep instead
