absolutly awful ! is this for real ? it sounds like john tesh or harry connick jr . i just got this cd and it put me to sleep . it should be called destination down the tube.i 'm a diehard bon jovi fan from new jersey and i can not believe he released this tragedy.i love all the cd 's from bon jovi but this solo by jon sounds like elevator or nursing home music.and for richie , bryan and tico , please do n't let jon out of your sight again
