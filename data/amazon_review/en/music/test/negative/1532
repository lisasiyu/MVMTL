a major dissapointment i have been a big fan of new found glory since `` all downhill from here '' came out . i bought catalyst and loved it , so i bought all their old albums , loved them all too . i found out new found glory had a new cd coming out ... ..couldnt wait . so i go out and buy this cd the day it came out , i was that excited , i brought it home thinking `` all right , this will be awesome ! ! ! '' over the next 40-some minutes i experienced the biggest dissapointment of my life . every song was a ballad , there were no fun songs like `` hit or miss '' `` forget my name '' `` the great houdini '' `` your biggest mistake '' or even an amazingly well written song like `` no news is good news . '' i basically got a whole cd of `` i do n't wan na know '' which in my mind was new found glory 's worst song to date . i listened to this cd once , and i barely made it through to the end and when it was over , i seriously considered throwing it in the trash . this band has died , after all those years of fun and great songs , they have been destroyed . i will do my best to erase this peice from my mind so i can enjoy their old albums again
