do n't see them live . it will ruin it . dear animal collective , i am mad at you for letting me drive two hours from home to be amongst your smelly patchouli stinking fans . i ca n't say i was happy when you guys to came out on stage and were completely ridiculous and well ... ..goofy . i never thought i would experience something that is the closest thing to a hippy rave , that i can think of . i was not impressed by all the crazy vocal effects you guys used . it sort of reminded me of that 16 year old kid messing around at guitar center . i noticed your almost dub/reggae influences ... that upset me . i am even more upset by the white boy tribal thing you have going . i noticed that you guys do n't sound anything like your albums . i noticed that the subtle things on the albums are exaggerated when played live to the point at where they are unenjoyable . i will have to listen to sung tongs again and see if holds up to your crazy live antics . seriously , i get the feeling your producer saved you . i hope that i can still enjoy your stuff without horrible flashbacks from tonight
