bah ... there 's really not much reason to buy this album . a year before this was released , mannheim released an album called `` halloween , '' which was a two-disc set , with one disc featuring music ( mostly mannheim arrangements of `` scary '' classical pieces like `` hall of the mountain king , '' plus a few rehases of old fresh aire tunes ) , and the other disc featured spooky sound effects . `` monster mix '' takes samplings from that two-disc set and gives you the abridged version on one disc for a couple of dollars less . they also threw in `` full moon '' , which was first released on their `` ambience series '' album , `` autumn song . '' incidentally , i like their `` autumn song '' album quite a bit better than either `` halloween '' or `` monster mix , '' but you can only get it directly through mannheim 's official website . for those who are n't familiar with the tracks on this disc -- some of the tracks are decent , though none reached the quality of music that mannheim put out back in the late 80s/early 90s . synthesizers always played a heavy role in mannheim 's music , but here , they get a bit overbearing and everything starts to sound a bit cheap and over-quantized ( in other words , it all feels like it was machine generated -- which , i suppose , it was . ) still , if you like the steamroller sound , and you want to hear them attempt a holiday other than christmas , you may find this interesting for a couple of listens . but then , just pay the extra dollar or two and get the full double-disc set called `` halloween . '' better yet , go to their website ( mannheimsteamroller.com ) and try `` autumn song . ''
