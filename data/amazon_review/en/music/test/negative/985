well , it 's progression ... ... .but backwards lets revisit the history of the band plain white t 's . their debut album `` stop '' was a very anthem filled songs about life and relationships that would appeal to mostly to people in highschool or perhaps young college students . this being said because the album talks alot about doing something with your life at pivotal moments and of course relationships . next , came their highly anticipated `` all that we needed '' album and it had more of a 80 's power pop/dance sound to it along with some of the songs possibly being mistaken for the band `` the cars '' . it had a more diverse vibe to it and i could see it appealing to highschoolers and most definitely college students . than this summer they released `` hey there delilah ep '' which was a solid ep which could appeal to many young adults with its mature sound to it . i figured since the ep was so good , that their debut for major label , hollywood records , would be fantastic . well , just the opposite folks . the plain white t 's have went backwards on `` every second counts '' . i mean way backwards ... back even before their debut album `` stop '' . i say this because the whole theme of the album is about relationships , relationships , and relationships . after about halfway through the album it sounds like you 're listening to a broken record . okay , i get it ! some girl screwed you over , and then you screwed her over and now you really do n't like each other anymore . the lyrics is what really kills this album along with the cliche songs . the lyrics in their first single , `` hate ( i really do n't like you ) '' is a perfect example of this . it cringes to repeat the chorus so i 'm not even going to do it . i mean , the lyrics sound like junior high drama instead of maturer songs about life which were in their previous albums . bottom line , they went to writing songs that highschoolers and young adults could relate to , to writing songs that junior high kids could relate to . i 'm sorry , but that 's not progression . i guess another word you could throw at these guys is `` sellout '' because that could very well be the case here . i 'm just going to pretend they did n't release this and enjoy their other albums . do n't get me wrong , the songs are catchy and all but the album just gets old and tiring after halfway through . i ca n't recommend this or not recommend this to anyone . old fans might enjoy , but also despise it like i do . anyways , their other albums are good so buy them before you ever even consider buying this one . download first..
