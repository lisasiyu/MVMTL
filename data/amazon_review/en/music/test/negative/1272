why listen to this garbage ? honestly , all her songs are sexual in some way . the way she poses , moves , dresses is wrong and sends the wrong message across . she is unmodest , makes herself into some sex toy on stage and videos , cant sing to save her life . rebecca st. james is definetly a good alternative that has enough self-confidence in her looks and voice that she doesnt have to wear a [ ... ] outfit on all her albums or cover-up her voice with a computer . get her transform album . great pop/rock/teckno-style music with a good message , better voice , and in my oponion , better looking artist .
