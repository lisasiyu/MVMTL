this sure ai n't `` buried in oblivion '' the new edition ( vocalist stu block ) has killed the perfect vocal line-up w/ his ridiculous , overkilled `` 80 's power metal '' screams . it just does n't fit & it ruins the few songs w/ potential on this release , which is a far cry from the last one anyway . there 's nowhere near as much melody in the music & pitifully few vocal harmonies , further widening the gap from oblivion . i keep listening ... hoping it 'll grow on me & i 'll somehow eventually get past the new festering puss-sore , nails-on-a-chalkboard style vocals , but it just ai n't hap'nin . fortunately for the band tho , it would seem i 'm the odd man out b/c all these other reviews seem to be raving . i sincerely hope no one else is as disappointed as i am . these guys have so much more talent & ability than comes thru on this cd . better luck next time fellas
