huge disappointment i 'm a really big christina fan . hands down , she is one of the most talented singers and has one of the best voices out there . this album is mostly filled with mediocre music with nothing artiscically original and drab lyrics . it would be nice if she quit the persona facades and came out as a pure artist and just acted herself instead of a role . although there are a couple of good tracks , the rest are filler . i was really disappointed with the outcome of this album .
