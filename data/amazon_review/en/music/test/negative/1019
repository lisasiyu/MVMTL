does n't mix well these three guys are amazing musicians in their own right but this album just does n't work . from a theory and technical standpoint it 's very good ( some would say brillant ) . if you have a background in music theory you 'll probably like it a lot . there is plenty of meat to chew on when it comes to breaking down the music and understanding what they are doing . but if you have listened to the police , phish and primus and you are just a big music fan then this is probably a very hard listen . it sounds like a car wreak of those three band 's music and there really is nothing new . trey 's guitar work sounds like the work he did with phish ; stewart 's drums are just like the police ( more of the old police stuff ) ; clay 's bass is right from any primus song . it sounds like what they did was take those aspects of their styles that would sort of fit together and just laid it out on this album . that 's fine , but it 's just hard not to think of phish , the police and primus while listening to it . the highlight of the album imo , is army 's on ecstasy . it opens up kind of slow and strange then picks up in a really nice jam frenzy for trey 's solo . that sort section of the ablum works really well together . for that section , it sounds like something outside the relm of phish , primus and the police .
