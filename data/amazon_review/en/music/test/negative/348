a dumb joke ... and i am not laughing i do not find this cd funny in the least bit . the song `` because i got high '' has got to be the dumbest thing ever written , with one of the most boring beats and repetitive lyrics that i have ever heard . also , there are other dumb songs like `` she wo n't let me '' . he tries so hard to be funny to the teenage crowd , and in some ways he succeeds , but to most people , i think that he will just be another annoying comedy rapper that us music listeners dont need to hear
