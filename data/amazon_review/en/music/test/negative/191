classic album -- terrible remastering first of all , i want to make clear that i think this is a phenomenal , 5-star album . this review is for the remastered edition of the cd only . if you already have the original cd release of this , hold on to it . that one has problems , but it at least sounds true to the original album . this remaster is an atrocity . the drums dominate the mix ( sorry cozy -- i do n't love you that much ) , while the vocals float in the background . worst of all , you have to strain to hear the guitar in many parts , with the synthesizer far more prominent . whoever remixed this is an idiot . evidently , they think that ritchie blackmore was the least important person in this band . i assume that most rainbow fans would disagree -- with no disrespect to the rest of this legendary lineup . rainbow rising is classic rock for people who enjoy guitar , not nu-metal for people who want to demo their subwoofers . it should have been mixed that way . beyond the sound of it , all these rainbow remastered re-issues are a rip-off in every other way , as well . no liner notes . no lyrics . no bonus tracks ( not even the inclusion of `` jealous lover '' with difficult to cure , which was on a cd single at the time of the album 's release ) . these re-issues are the worst i 've seen from any band . compare them to the deep purple anniversary remasters and it becomes obvious how much more could have been done with these . in my opinion , this is an insult to the diehard fans who are purchasing these releases for the third or fourth time ( lp , first cd release , japan import cd , and newly `` remastered '' version ) . if you do n't have this yet , you should buy any version you can find as quickly as possible , because you 've been missing out . but for anyone who already has a previous release of this cd , you should just save your money
