what a waste this cd will no doubt appeal to drunken frat boys and fellow travelers , but to me it 's all a waste of what once was a genuinely interesting ( though far too self-indulgent ) singer . in the old days i could forgive the relentless self-pity about how awful it was to be his father 's son , because the occasional great performance came through . but there 's no such saving grace here - and the explicit lyrics are just pathetic ; we 've all heard more accomplished filth from grade schoolers . no wonder amazon - and most other retailers - are discounting this cd so heavily
