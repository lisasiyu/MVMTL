as many iq points as notes there is nothing remotely heavy and/or musical about this band . every song uses the same three powerchords , the same drum lines , the same taking-a-dump vocal histrionics , the same lyrics of no substance and one subject . do yourselves a favor and find something actually artistically worthy of the intelligent mind , and do n't be fooled into thinking that this is heavy in any non-primitive way
