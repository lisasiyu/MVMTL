this is just boring . ok , i hate to say it , but this never grew on me , i grabbed it when it first came out and , sadly , still it 's very weak . i 'm a huge kool keith fan and this is very disapointing . by far it 's his worst album . he needs to get back with dan the automator or something , these tracks are boring and go nowhere , with a couple exceptions -- so if it 's dirt cheap it 's worth grabbing . this does nothing for me , i hope he gets back on track
