please note all the five-star reviews by kids remember the style of music that came out in the late 70 's called punk ? the pioneers of this type of music were bands such a clash , the sex pistols , the ramones and the talking heads . the style becamse somewhat funk-influenced to the gut-wrentching hardcore metal influenced sounds of the dead kennedies and ministry . even social distortion had their own little sound to offer . this is how it went through the 80 's . yet , after the who nirvana-mania that saved music from whitesnake and warrent , punk , as well as many other sounds , seemed lost until ... green day comes around with `` dookie . '' this continued the punk sound into what we know today . so in the words of oasis : `` where did it all go wrong . '' it 's not that this sounds on it 's own is bad . when blink 182 first came out , they had a lot of fun to offer . but gawd , where do we draw the line ? after that , we had ( in no particular order ) sum 41 , new found glory , my chemical romance , showoff , and jeez , i could go on forever . they all sound so much alike . still they were once tolerable . but with simple plan , ( sigh ) , enough is enough . i ca n't even tell the difference sometimes between these guys and bowling for soup . and i do n't easily confuse bands . really , though , these guy call themselves punk . but last time i checked , punk was about rebellion , anarchy , disatisfaction with where humanity is going , all that stuff . ex sex pistols `` anarchy in the uk '' or ramones `` i 'm against it . '' now listen to some of the titles off this : `` i 'm just a kid , '' `` god must hate me , '' `` i 'd do anything . '' difference ? you 'd have to be blind not to see one . these guys have jumped on the `` poser '' bandwagon that every other `` punk '' band on a major label has jumped on , and thus , mainstream punk is doing the same thing heavy metal is
