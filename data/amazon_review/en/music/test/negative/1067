another of the greats has degenerated into total pop garbage back in the beginning of the extreme music genesis , these guys were one of the pioneers of extreme music . they certainly were n't any of the forms of extreme metal and they certainly were n't punk . unfortunately , they were put into the alternative category which was a catch-all for music that was basically pop while supposedly rejecting the `` mainstream sound '' . that 's right the butthole surfers were stuck in the category that cursed the world with nirvana / nine inch nails / ministry / smashing pumpkins garbage . oh , that reminds me , it cursed the 80s with all those hideous sub-pop label bands . still there were a few `` alternative '' bands that were quite good . only the surfers and big black come to mind though . their live shows were incredible . flashing movie clips flashed strange scenes in the back ground including sex change operation footage . the singer constantly lit his hand on fire for some reason ( as if it were a big dangerous stunt ) , naked women danced on stage , and a certain song they used a huge tuba . their two best albums were hairway to steven and locust abortion technician but some of the earlier ones could be considered as good as these two . there song styles varied from song to song . they would have crazy fast songs such as human cannonball or really slow drugged out songs such as 22 going on 23 with a depressed radio talk show clip played in the background . they would also utilize oriental sounds modified in their own weird style on the classic kuntz ( spelling ) . we also got the weird rantings on `` johnny smokes '' who was a `` crippled midget lesbian boy who stood ten foot tall with a knife ! '' well , they got to be pretty popular and appeared on the alternative music fest tour lollapalooza and soon after actually got signed to a major label . the last i heard probably over 10 years old was some songs off of the major label release `` independent worm saloon '' . they had seriously sold out their style degenerating in a more acceptable mainstream sound . i had n't paid attention for these many years but recently checked out this weird revolution . this has got to be one of the most extreme sell-out jobs ever . i ca n't think of a worse bit of conforming to please mainstream record labels hoping for success . i have seen plenty and most of them quite bad but i honestly ca n't think of any that tops this . this is the kind of pumping technopop you see in bad movies . what happened ? i am not aware of how popular these guys have become or not but it is one of the saddest falls of a great band i have ever known
