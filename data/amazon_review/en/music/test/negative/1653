fell off for as long as i can remember i have been a fan of krs-one/b.d.p . and i have to say that this is the worst album i have heard by him . sound wise most of these tracks sound pretty commercial and could easily be heard on the radio . lyrically the `` teacher '' that we all know and love has fallen off to a point that he may never be able to recover i mean the lyrics are downright terrible . this is a sad day for hip hop fans every where . their is not a single song on this album that is even close to enjoyable . lets hope that in the futre krs can get it together and release another banger . but for now i think ill stick with sneak attack the last truly great lyrical album
