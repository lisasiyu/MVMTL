very boring i 've been wanting to see this movie and i finally did on logo . i 'm just happy i waited untill it came on tv . i though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it . the romance was slim to none . i thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role . well , i wo n't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it . anyway , i would much rather watch beautiful thing , get real , all over the guy & the incredibly true adventure of two girls in love
