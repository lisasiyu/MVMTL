this should be endangered . i would n't have bothered if not for the fact that there was only one review for this cd giving it 5 stars ... a real injustice . this is a piece of garbage , plain and simple . if you liked their first cd you 'll prolly wana smash this into little pieces and then hunt down every member of the band , no joke . the guy has a horrible voice and it 's only good when he yells , which is maybe in 2 songs on this cd , both of which fall apart after the heavy point . pure garbage , if you do n't believe me buy it and see for yourself , there 's a reason this cd is n't as popular as through the eyes and its cause it sucks
