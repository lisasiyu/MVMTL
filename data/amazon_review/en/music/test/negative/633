boo ... . hiss ! this is good hip-hop music , but that 's all it is . the infectious tango track from the movie , ( which was even used again for the title page on dvd ) , is conspicuously not there , nor any waltz , rumba or other ballroom music tracks that were in the movie . i thought this was a movie about urban school kids who learn ballroom dancing ! sure , the hip-hop tracks should be there too because that was an integral part of the film , but that was only about half the music in the film . and in this case , the absence of ballroom dancing tracks , for a movie specifically about ballroom dancing is unforgivable . there should be a disclaimer on the cover of this cd to warn away anyone looking for the great , danceable tango , waltz , etc . tracks that were in the film .
