mr durst , please tell the class , how does one spell ''biscuit ? '' limp bizkit ? metal ? the two go together like when dante met bosh in a crack alley in bogota : a real big mess ... being a true metal fan ( a la , slayer , testament , pissing razors and megadeth ) i find limp bizkit 's excuse for metal as nothing more than a pathetic joke . metal never had rap in it 's fold , and to even attempt to combine the two spectrums together would be disgracing the world of metal ... and i 'm sure rap fans would be equally angry . make up your mind , durst ( your stupidly miniscule mind ) . are you a metaller ? or a rapper ? oh , and i suggest that fred goes back to school so that he can pay attention in his english language lessons so that he might just learn how to spell properly .
