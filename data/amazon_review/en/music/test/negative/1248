'double-time ' to cadence this recording is not meant as workout aid . the cadence is 'double-time ' ( equivalent to a 'jog ' ) not 'running . ' the numerous jody snippets ( and that is what they are ) on this and i would assume similar recordings are meant to fill a special niche in music ; that being the archiving of the military 's equivalent to sea chanties , road gang and field songs . they make hard , boring , repetitive work go easier . god knows pounding down a road for ten miles with a full ruck is a challenge physically and mentally . these recordings would be much more useful workout-wise if , rather than snippets , they were longer . there are a couple of dis though on this recording that have real talent ; good 'lyrics ' , good voices and a hell of a lot of character . as an aside ; my the military has certainly become pc since the 60 's ! these jody 's are n't anything like the ones i recall from boot camp - with only one exception that pops to mind . ( my '2 star ' grade is for missing the mark as a workout aid . i 'd give it '3 stars ' for what i call it 's archival 'potential ' which could be improved substantially .
