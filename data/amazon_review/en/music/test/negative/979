i 'm going to keep it real actually , i 'm going to keep it really real . i know most of you reviewers who gave this album 4-5 stars reviews are too blinded by 1980 's nostalgia to see and hear that this music is utter crap . vanity 6 was hot back in the day , but it was due to their s1utty image and not their music . why do you think the only song you hear by them on the radio is `` nasty girls '' ? that 's the only song people remember them for . let me tell you a secret : this cd is n't worth $ 29.52 . in fact it should n't be worth anything because the music is boring- nothing 'hilarious ' or 'interesting ' about it . plenty of of melodies being sung in warbly vocals over casio go-go beats w/ no bass . i was able to download all of the tracks and after i listened to them , i thanked my lucky stars that i did n't spend one dime on it . vanity was beautiful , but she could n't sing or dance . susan tried to portray herself as cute and innocent , but she could n't really pull it off with that moustache . brenda was just whatever . i feel sorry for anyone who buys `` vanity 6 ''
