best punk compilation ever ? i beg to differ ! ) : & lt ; let 's get one thing strait : i am deffidently not a punk hater , and deffidently not an mtv loser fan . in fact , punk rock is my favorite type of music . but i did not like punk o rama volume 5 . i just did not find it cool , catchy , or even ok . it sucked . the only songs i really liked were the pennywise song and the vision song ( which is about being close minded , and i do n't like people who are close minded ) , and the pulley song was okay , though the singer 's voice annoys the heck outta me . the rest is bland , unoriginal , and annoying . even the rancid song was annoing . yes , you heard me right . everyone 's so-called favorite punk band 's song was annoying . at borders , i had the choice between this and afi 's all hollows e.p . i now know better than that . if you liked this cd , fine . just remember to buy good punk cds from bands like the distillers , misfits , the ramones , offspring , rise against , and early afi , out of respect for good punk
