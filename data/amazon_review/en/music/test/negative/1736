save your money i got nothing but mad love and respect for the outlaws but they have def lost a step since pac 's death . i think tupac must have wrote there rhymes cause they def do not have any skills . the cd also lacks production ! the beats are terrible . the outlawz worldwide cd was also a huge waste !
