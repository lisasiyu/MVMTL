if you love the raiders `` do the right thing-buy sundazed '' i originally purchased the set upon it 's original release in 1990 , over the years i have listened to it may times , continuing to comparing it to many other remastered tracks and cds of its time ... always concluding that the tracks ( especially disc 1 , disc 2 kicks in with `` him or me '' ) sounded like they came directly from vinyl , i have today just received the sundazed midnight ride . let me tell you if you love this stuff as i do , and want to hear the raiders , pass on this collection , and get the sundazed , the sound blows `` legend '' out the door ! i ca n't wait to get the rest on sun .
