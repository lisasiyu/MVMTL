antichrist super-ripoff alright , here goes the first intelligent low rating this album has recieved . no i 'm not some christian preaching to you , i 'm actually a fan of manson . i think the lyrics on this album are pretty good , but mediocre music . my main problem with this album is the fact that it is a total rip-off of david bowie . let 's look at the man himself . manson wears contacts to make it look like he has two different colored eyes , while bowie actually has two different eyes . with ziggy stardust , bowie 's image became androgynous , just as manson 's always has been . now let 's look at the actual albums of ziggy and antichrist . they both tell the story of a self-destructive unearthly rock and roll superstar . manson 's shock rock symbol even bears a strong resemblance to the ziggy lightning bolt . and this all comes from a man constantly preaching individualiry , while making an idol of himself , and slamming other artists for ripping him off . and then he put out mechanical animals , an exact replica of ziggy stardust , and ironically enough it 's what made him truly famous . i just think it 's a little hypocritical . check out holy wood . it is much better lyrically and musically , and far more original . the other thing that really pisses me off is the vocal department . a lot of fans are saying his voice is underated , but i hate to say , he really ca n't sing . watch the guns god and government tour and see how he really sounds . all he 's basically good for are his writing skills..
