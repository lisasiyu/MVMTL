he 's just as bad as the people he patronizes i hate to condemn records i bought . mainly because it 's a confession that i 've wasted my money on bad art . & quot ; sail away & quot ; is bad , and could have been worse except for a few good songs : & quot ; last night i had a dream & quot ; , & quot ; simon smith.. & quot ; , & quot ; political science & quot ; , & quot ; memo to my son & quot ; , & amp ; & quot ; dayton ohio - 1903 & quot ; . the rest are as near to awful as you can get . good lyricist ? i do n't think so . besides his awful attacks on touchy subjects , his phrasing is always typical , and his rhyming hardly goes as far as rhyming & quot ; me & quot ; with & quot ; be & quot ; . i already had & quot ; good old boys & quot ; ( decent ) , and the songs on & quot ; sail away & quot ; were practically ripped right off of the former album . the music is almost always unlively ( simple piano chords ) ; hardly the riveting stuff i usually listen to . this is a big scar in my music collection
