truly , welcome to the suck . and this year 's crud-fest winner , the person who received the most votes from every brain-dead glossy eyed plankton watching ... .. who even cares anymore ? yet another drone pulled off the production line , this gimp being another in the long run of inoffensive handsome white boys , aimed primarily at stupid people and , judging by the popularity of this single , there are an awful , awful lot of . so let 's talk about the single . with the exception of the excrement that was last years winner ( steve brookstein , currently missing in action - yet another one-hit wonder who we 'll never see again ) first ( and only ) solo attempt - the dire phil collins cover , this is easily the worst actual attempt at a song yet . originally planned for westlife , `` that 's my goal '' was panned and rejected by them ( them ! westlife ! ) for being too weak , but it sure was n't weak enough for shayne ward , currently number one for the fourth week running as i type this . but what does that mean , exactly ? i 'll tell you - nothing . the general public are such idiots , such pathetic , `` tell us what to buy and we will '' easily led cretins , that they would buy anything after seeing it on a reality program . shayne ward could have released a record of him whistling the marmite theme and it would have gone straight to number one . and it 's going to continue , is n't it ? this was a massive hit , the show was a massive hit , so we 're going to continue to be bombarded with bland , generic singers and pointless songs like this . if you bought this junk , or if you watched this junk , the curmudgeon holds you personally responsible . you should be ashamed of yourself for bringing yourself down to the gutter masses , watching this easily-digestible pond-life program , and buying its cynical , disgusting products . one day , i hope to live in a world where television is not swamped by reality television , where tv schedules and budgets are not ruled by programs aimed at the great unwashed , where the charts are not in the vice-like grasp of dire tv talent show winners ( and losers ) . that , ladies and gentlemen , that , is my goal . the_curmudgeon_hates_you @ yahoo.co.u
