the trouble with tributes the trouble with all-star tribute albums to past superstar artists and bands is that oftentimes they are done purely for money , attention , and a sense that certain of those artists can one-up the artists being paid the `` tribute '' to ; and often , the results do n't come close to measuring up to the originals . such , i 'm afraid , is the case with the 1993 common threads album , where nashville artists give their props to that renegade bunch of desperados who occupied the hotel california for most of the 1970s , the eagles . the brainchild of eagles manager irving azoff , who saw how revered the band had become amongst the nashville hierarchy of the nineties , common threads also functioned as a charity album , whose profits went to the walden woods project , of which eagles drummer don henley was a particularly prominent supporter . were it not for that one particular aspect , common threads would be as much an aberration as a lot of other tribute albums of its type . even as this album already stands , however , and even though it caused hell to freeze over and the eagles to reunite , the artists here still fall well short of what the band originally did . what seems to have happened here is that each of the artists got so caught up in the idea of doing songs from the eagles ' massively successful catalog that they thought they could get off by copying almost note-for-note and by arrangement what the band had done ; one listen to travis tritt 's version of `` take it easy '' , and vince gill 's take on `` i ca n't tell you why '' seems to indicate this . in other cases , they sound terribly anemic , as in clint black 's version of `` desperado '' , where he sounds like second-rate john denver ( and i think john denver could have done this far better than clint black ) . and hearing faux-eagles wanna-bes like little texas doing `` peaceful easy feeling '' and diamond rio doing `` lyin ' eyes '' is no substitute whatsoever for the real thing . the womenfolk do n't have it much easier either . lorrie morgan simply sounds out of place on `` the sad cafe '' , seemingly not having any idea about the song 's mournful inspiration ; and tanya tucker 's toughness on `` already gone '' is quite dull . suzy bogguss ' take on `` take it to the limit '' is a bit better , but it wo n't make anyone forget the randy meisner-led original . and trisha yearwood 's version of `` new kid in town '' is okay , but she sounds like she 's trying to do it the way she thinks her idol linda ronstadt would , and it 's not totally successful either . in the end , the inability of contemporary nashville artists to really understand the eagles lies in the fact that there is a very wide gap between the eagles ' sound of the 1970s and the way contemporary music row does things . though classified as `` country-rock '' , the eagles also mixed in elements of bluegrass , surf-rock , r & b , disco , and even tex-mex a time or two , styles that are largely alien to contemporary nashville . as linda herself , around whom the eagles originally formed in 1971 , has said , it is a part of the diverse spectrum of california music : `` california music is a real hybrid , very specialized , and it does n't have anything to do with nashville . '' this is something that i 'm not sure these artists really understand , and why i ca n't give this album a better rating
