awful compilation cd - no original artists drew 's famous party music is a joke . i wish i had read the reviews before i purchased this cd . in the past 3 weeks , i have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd 's looking for great music from the 70s , 80s and 90 's for a party i am hosting . i read the reviews for the other cd 's and they were great , but in my excitement about finding whoomp there it is and love train , i did n't check the reviews for this cd . this cd is not at all what i thought it would be . trust me , this is not the one , it 's not even on the list . i was looking for whoomp there it is , and especially love train by the ojays . not what i got . i excitedly listened to whoomp , and i kept saying this does n't sound right . something sounds like its missing from the song . so i listened to love train , and immediately , i knew that it was not the ojays singing . i realized that none of the original artists were singing . this is a terrible misrepresentation . i was so disappointed ! thank goodness i listened to the cd before i played it at the party . i would have been horrified . i wish i could give it less than one star and get a refund . please , please , please do n't waste your money
