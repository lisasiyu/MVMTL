an absolute waste of money do yourselves a favour kids , save your money do n't go to the show , i mean do n't buy this soundtrack . here are some tips about it . it runs for a mere 29 minutes . that 's awfully short . there are 8 songs and 8 portions of dialogue . most of these portions of dialogue last a few seconds , radio announcements of songs . the best portion is the harvey keitel bit , 'if the manager thinks he 's charles bronson , cut off one of his fingers ' . the songs now . little green is a decent enough song , cocunut is a good song . i gotcha is okay . stuck in the middle with you is a good song but has been ruined for me because it has been played to death on tv and radio . the other 4 songs are a joke . so basically it 's a total waste of money . the pulp fiction soundtrack is a lot better than this one . stop
