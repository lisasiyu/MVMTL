mostly a dud , unfortunately ... disney , in my opinion , dropped the ball for the third installment of the disney classics cds ( which is probably why you only see 1 and 2 advertised on tv ) . the only tracks really worth it are `` i 'll try '' ( although i have no idea what that is from ) and `` he lives in you '' . other than that , most of the tracks are boring and no up to the level most of the others are . i would not suggest purchasing this cd
