great music , horrible sound ken burns and company have assembled some classic parker takes , but the sound quality is dismal . yes , we know these recordings were made before the advent of tape , etc. -- i do n't think most people interested in parker recordings are looking for pristine studio sound , but this is a disgrace . i have many c.p . recordings , including lots of old verve and savoy issues on lp -- none of them sound as bad as this cd . not just surface noise , but actual musical distortion that could have been mitigated with today 's technology . i was suckered into this one by the burns affiliation , since i had enjoyed the tv jazz series . not a fraction of the care put into that effort was expended on the cd . there is so much parker out there today put out with more care ; i would look to the dial and savoy sessions , for example
