same day , predicable album . kurupt has made some good albums in the past , but this one is real dissappointment from him , i expected more from this guy , but the writing is not impressive and the lyrical content is out of reach , although there are some good songs , west coast fans will love him and that 's fine , but i thought it was too predicable and too over the top . thumbs down
