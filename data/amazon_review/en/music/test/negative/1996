mass hypnosis the only thing that can account for the acclaim that some have lavished on this album is mass hypnosis . signor bocelli 's publicists have declared that he has 'the most beautiful voice in the world ' and people believe it . i agree with the reviewer who described listening to this cd as painful . everything sounds the same -- -like sandpaper . if he were not adorable and blind , this fellow would not have a career even as a pop artist , never mind opera singer . if you want to hear what opera sounds like at its best and most real today , check out ramon vargas , juan diego florez , rolando villazon , marcello giordani and discover the difference between creme brulee and instant pudding
