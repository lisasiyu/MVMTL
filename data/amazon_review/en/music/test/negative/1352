a flop the 80 's was a really bad time for alice cooper . he had become a joke of his old self . he tried to do what aerosmith did with p vacation and comeback with a hair metal commerical album , but he flatout fails . the guitar playing is n't that bad at all , but the lyrics are cheesy making even the decent songs like teenage frankenstein , he 's back and crawlin pretty much guilty pleasures . the rest of the album is pure 80 's mediocrity
