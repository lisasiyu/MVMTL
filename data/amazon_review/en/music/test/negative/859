disappointing ... ... and i 'm a charlap fan . high hopes . but this recording , though given star treatment/art department/high gloss packaging with liner notes by playwright john guare , is listless and uninspiring . yes , nicely arranged and all that , but airless . it never breathes ; it rarely swings ... a couple new chord interpolations , one tempo surprise , one or two harmonic sparks -- way too few and far between to recommend . pastel . pleasant . but miles from jazz . if you want to hear bernstein songs in a & quot ; nice & quot ; piano trio format with few challenging ideas , this is for you . bill evans is the standard for & quot ; lucky to be me & quot ; and & quot ; some other time. & quot ; oscar peterson / andre previn for the & quot ; west side & quot ; soundtrack . much promise goes unfulfilled here..
