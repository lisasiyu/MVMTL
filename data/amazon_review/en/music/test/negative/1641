time to retire i ca n't believe this band is still together because their music was never any good to begin with . i know so many friends who are such huge fans of this band and i ca n't figure out why anybody would want to listen to these guys because their music is so dull . motley crue is the kind of band where you can just take their record and just throw it in the garbage . the only reason why these guys got back together is because they needed the quick cash to pay off their debts . to their credit , at least they still have some fans left who will pay top dollar to see them perform live
