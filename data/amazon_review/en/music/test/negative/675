zzzzzzzzzzzz ... oh my , what can i say about this whispery little train wreck . it 's third-rate coffee house music that struggles to be heard over conversations ( as it should be ) . in the quiet sanctuary of my den , it 's revealed for all it is n't . it is n't clever , musically or lyrically , and just drones along seemingly forever . my audiophile friends would like it because the sparse notes and little extraneous noises would make their overly analytical and fatiguing systems sound magical . unless you 're into performances that sound influenced by heavy doses of thorazine , do n't bother
