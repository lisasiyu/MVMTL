copies amazed power-ballad success way too much lonestar did n't really surprise me with their 2001 effort . i 'm already there and not a day goes by suffers from `` amazed '' syndrome . amazed 's 1999 multi-format mega success is spread all over this album , their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad . did they listen to monster ballads 2 too much while making this album in nashville ? i 'm already there comes off as very diane warren-ish in its sappy lyrics . their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay , but these songs do n't work for them . these songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this .
