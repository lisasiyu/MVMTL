yeah , awful what is this ? his first album was great . i think this was trying to be too differnt and obscure . like the beyond belief weird , `` the omen , '' ( part 2 of damien ) with marilyn manson . most of the music backrounds and not good and dont flow . plus some of the rhymes dont make any sense , and are just there for the sake of rhyming , `` ai n't no way . '' and as a second album it does it justice to being way more dirty and hardcore . just the second track alone , `` bring your whole crew , '' dmx speaks of raping a girl , killing someone and then having sex with the corpse . i mean didnt you notice by the cover of dmx imersed in blood ? i mean , `` slipping , '' is alright and , `` it 's all good , '' `` heat . '' as a whole , very un-enjoyable . i would be happy never hearing this again . i mean inevative is great ! but this mabye went too far , there were n't really any popular singles except for , `` slippin ' '' a lot of people think dmx is a god , and i remember dmx being a little bothered by that . a while ago the man was busted for inpersonating a police officer and pulling someone over . no to this
