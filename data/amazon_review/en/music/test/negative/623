i think that the song lips of an angel should be renamed `` i 'm just not that into you or my girlfriend either '' extreme behaviour ? i think not . perhaps extremely bad lyrics . was this dude stoned when he wrote the lyrics or really that shallow ? i just love that romantic song that they play on the radio all the time about the dude that 's cheating on his girl friend w/ another woman and they dare to call it lips of an angel ? could it get any sicker ? i think the song should be retitled welcome to hell
