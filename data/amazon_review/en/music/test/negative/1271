'fly ' not good enough to carry this one i thought this album might be decent based on 'fly , ' but it is amazingly garbage . the only song besides 'fly ' that i thought was good was speedhome california , maybe because it talks about california and i live here . but sadly this album is not worth the $ 2.99 i paid for i
