worth checking out jerry is one of history 's great stand up comedians , no doubt . that is why this is worth listening to . be aware that yes , there is a lot of material on here that is old . basically stuff you might have seen jerry perform on an hbo special back in like 1982 . i think since he regrettably never released a stand up record before he decided to use a lot of this to preserve it on a cd . that in conjunction with the fact that he might not have had that much new material . i wish he had vintage stuff of him recorded from small comedy clubs back in the 80s . i always prefer on a comedy record that it is performed in a small club as opposed to a huge arena or hall . you definitely lose all of the intimacy that i think makes for the best stand up comedy experience . all in all since this is jerry 's one and only comedy record it is certainly worth checking out , let 's face it a mediocre jerry output is better than a lot of comedians best stuff .
