listen first i wish i could have found a snippit of each song when deciding whether or not to purchase this album . instead i relied upon the other reviews and my memory of 'take on me ' and 'the living daylights ' from when i was younger . i decided to take a chance and purchase this album . i listened to the album once and have no real desire to hear it again . the music/lyrics stink ( unless the listener considers hearing about broken relationships and lack of commitment to other people and oneself enjoyable ) . i would definitely listen to any of ah-ha 's albums/songs prior to deciding whether or not to purchase them
