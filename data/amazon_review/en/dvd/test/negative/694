empty shell i have never been a demi moore fan , but this movie is even worse than i imagined it would be . my kids picked it up in the videotheque . i decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them . demi 's acting is rather passionless , poor and disconnected . she looks old too ! she does n't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too . after just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in scotland to write a new novel . yeah , sure . that 's what i would do after losing my only child . i probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so . after five minutes you do n't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her . you can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen . and all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly . a guy who is alone on an island for years who does n't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it . and who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly . a mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere . i expected a film with supernatural elements , but boy did i get fooled . some of the photography and scenery was acceptable , but the cgi generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly . alas , not a film that i can recommend to anyone .
