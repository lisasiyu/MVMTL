not as funny or creative or whimsical as the first two ! this rugrats movie is the worst of the three . obviously , it was made for promotion and cash more than anything . nickelodeon did n't consider the plot in the process , so the movie suffers . the plot is complex , yet it still manages to be too simple to be taken seriously , and it has about fifty holes and sub-plots . the movie is too complex for even a 10-year-old to grasp . since rugrats is aimed for 3-9 year olds , they wo n't get it . the main promotions for the movie were the scratch and sniff sequence [ also , burger king promotion to go with that ] , and the fact that spike would now talk . hah ! spike talked in the episode of the series about chuckie 's dreams . besides , smelling some disgusting card [ that you can smell anytime , not during the movie ] is n't fun . the burger smells more like spoiled milk . anyway , the movie is fluffy and light and tries for a few forced laughs but it dose n't happen . debbie 's well-publicized line and the & quot ; that is so wrong ! & quot ; line , and the wedgie-dance , are among the stupidest things i have ever seen . maybe an 8-year-old would disagree . being 12 , i found the humour pretty dumb . so you 're aware , i love the series . this movie just was n't creative at all , it was more of a thornberry-type flick . and finally , it just is n't whimsical or special in any way . not recommended for anything except a rental from the video store , if that
