if turbulence ca n't break your onboard implausibility meter nothing will ! too bad i can not give turbulence no stars . this movie is just filled with way too many things that just stretch even the most liberal imaginations well past the limits of reality ! the whole movie just does not work . the fbi agents are too easily overcome and out smarted by a self professed genius serial killer whose one dimensional actions make his iq seem incredibly average to me . rather than being very smart the serial killer seemed a self absorbed slob who is overly impressed with his own lame exploits . the rest of the airplane passengers seem like fawns or sheep . logic suggests when transporting a dangerous horde of hardened criminals the crew would be a select group of individuals hand picked for their skill at dealing with a plane full of diseased brilliant minded malefactors . the plot is obviously concocted to introduce fawn like ladies and foppish men into the mix so the audience has a heightened thrill factor . problem is the other non-law enforcement passengers seem inserted into the plot for no good reason other than their role as pawns to be used by the serial killer to drag an otherwise painfully predictable lifeless story along to its all too formulaic end . also the christmas lights festooned all over the plane when you are carrying hardcore prisoners is so over the top that you must wonder what the heck were the writers thinking . most hardcore prisoners are quite intelligent and could certainly turn all those dangling christmas lights to their advantage in some vile criminal way . no fbi agent or corrections officer worth his or her salt would let a prisoner set foot in a plane that had so many opportunities for prisoners to escape their direct care custody and control . also the most glaring flaw in turbulence occurs when even the most basic tenants of maintaining care custody and control of violent malignant inmates were overlooked again and again . the plane skimming over buildings through rooftops into structures was just plain stupid . while most tall buildings roof top garden rooms and associated elements are lightly constructed they must stand up to high winds . add that buildings the plane was scraping had mechanical equipment towers where strong girders and supports reside that should have broken the plane up or at least damaged it more than was shown . it is like the writers of turbulence were a bunch of college drama students drunk and totally detached from reality got challenged to come up with a disaster thriller plot . drama for drama 's sake without any plausible relationship to reality is not thrilling or action adventure it is just disjointed stupid garbage . turbulence is just garbage to watch when you have time to waste . if you want real suspense on a plane get air force one . turbulence is an invitation to take a round trip to and from palooka-ville , the plane has plenty of seats available but who cares ! . this turbulence is just a bumpy ride that leaves you feeling sick . i can think of better ways to spend time .
