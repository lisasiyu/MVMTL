do n't waste your time even renting it it 's sad when a commercial is superior to the movie , but the boogeyman is an example of that particular reality . even renting this film is a waste of time . had they attempted to explain the entire thing with tim being a schizophrenic who flipped out and killed everyone , but hallucinated the boogeyman doing it , then that would 've probably saved the film , but it did n't end that way . tim is the typical screwed up , scared of the closet kid , only about twenty years too old , being traumatized by having seen his father get mangled in the closet by the boogeyman . after posing for the first twenty minutes as having rewritten this event into just a way of dealing with his father 's leaving ( not very convincing , by the way ) , he goes home after his mother 's death and decides to face his old fears by spending a night in the house he grew up in . then follows a group of messily edited , badly written , and confusing events that make no sense and are not even remotely explained . for no apparent reason , he drags along for about an hour an old childhood friend named kate , who conveniently keeps showing up with only flimsy contrived excuses . she rides over to his house on a horse which for no reason throws her off ; he has no food so she rides her bike late at night over to bring him some . none of this would be that bad if it was n't for the fact that the last fifteen minutes were a series of absurd events . his excessively touchy-feely girlfriend shows up , drives him to a motel , and vanishes . he goes into a closet and comes out in his old house 's closet and jumps at kate ( there to give the gift of food ) . he goes and chats with a girl , who was following him around asking about the boogeyman who then was dead but still showing up , being a kind of spiritual advisor on destroying childhood demons . he goes into closets and appears in different buildings , sometimes under beds , gets pulled under beds and comes out closets , and something about nailing a chair in front of a closet and facing the boogeyman turns into him smashing and destroying everything in his old room as a means of destroying the boogeyman . it would have been all okay had it been the delusions of a madman , with his sudden appearances elsewhere being blackouts and flashes of memory . but no , it was supposed to be a real , non-cgi boogeyman . the result was a cheesy , boring , 90 minute film that should 've ended way sooner , because even at a hour and a half , it went too long . it could 've been good if it had just not tried to make the whole boogeyman thing a literal thing , but of course , they did n't . and what was that with his girlfriend ? he walks through a closet and finds himself in the motel bathroom where she vanished , sees gray water pouring out of the faucet , then she pops out of the water a few times to be apparently drowned or at least repeatedly covered with splashing dirty water by some watery manifestation of , yes , the boogeyman . then he goes to his room , with the ever present kate , smashed a few toys , and everything was peachy . i 've watched horror movies since about the age of six , a good eleven years , from nightmare on elm st. , to the hammer films , to dracula ( about forty of them ) , to evil dead , and this one just sucks . there are so many better horror movies to choose from .
