worst concert dvd i own . i own about 40 various concert dvd 's and must say this is about the worst of the lot . the reason - the concert footage is almost unwatchable . i ca n't for the life of me understand why they felt the need to change camera shots every 1 or 2 seconds ( you get 3 seconds if your lucky ) but that 's they way they put this together . i actually counted the number of changes over the course of 1 minute during the performance of jet and it was 51 . 51 camera changes in 60 seconds of footage - you do the math on that . it 's really a shame too because the concerts really seem to be excellent . paul has a great backing band and the songs sound fresh and filled with energy . in the end it does n't matter as it 's not possible to sit down and enjoy watching it
