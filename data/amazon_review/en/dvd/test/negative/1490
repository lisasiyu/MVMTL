evel knievel deserved better then this flop . this movie was on tnt and the dvd will not make it any better . this might be worse then viva knievel from 1977 . while i thought george eads was a good choice i did n't think so after watching it . the book by steve mandich was great and very accurate but the movie suffers from a poor script . you never find out why evel started to jump for a living . they never show the showman part of evel . instead they show really stupid things like evel going to the bathroom twice in the movie .
