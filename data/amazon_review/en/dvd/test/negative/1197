a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon as a fan of mme . austen , thomas hardy , d.h. lawrence and other sundry novelists of manner , i freely admit to a hopeless addiction to `` period '' pieces -- and romances , in particular -- and this weakness clearly plays into the very generous aforementioned 2-star rating . `` northanger abbey '' is a charming bit of camp for a rainy afternoon , but please do n't expect this movie to be anything like the big-money hollywood adaptations of mme . austen 's other works . the acting is over-the-top ; the soundtrack , deplorable ; and the characters ( with the exception of eleanor ) are completely unsympathetic . catherine is portrayed as an insipid half-wit , rather than a day-dreamy post-adolescent on the verge of womanhood . peter firth 's henry tilney vascilates between compassionate , brotherly concern and annoyingly superior arrogance . by the end of the movie , i had lost all patience with them and was convinced that henry & catherine fully deserve the misery they will inevitably wreak upon each other . ( this from a romance buff ! ) most will give up before the end of the film , but true austen fans will enjoy the parade of costumes , witty repartee , and the opportunity to daydream about the regency culture . watch it or do n't -- but if you choose to watch , make sure you do so with a sense of humor and forebearance .
