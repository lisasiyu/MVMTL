you 've got to be kidding me while some movies require that you throw out your disbelief , i had a very hard time doing so with this movie . this movie was just plain stupid . they should have kept this film story in the states . once everything moves over to tokyo , the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which i have n't seen in a long time . i would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to japan . so let 's get this straight , japanese high school students act like american high school students ? lucas black 's character is simply told to go to a japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do ? everybody speaks english ? his father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that 's about double the size of his apartment ? i would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt , looked and sounded more japanese . japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet . the japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful , polite and dutiful . real japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here . actually they probably would n't be embarassed , they would laugh at the film 's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true japanese culture . japanese culture is not steeped in american hiphop and egocentric behavior and it 's a pity so many americans will see this film and actually think that japanese students are just like american students . there would be nothing further from the truth . japanese students do not act , look or sound like what was filmed here . not by a long shot . given my dislike of how the japanese culture was handled in this film , it left me finding the plot irrelevant . the plot was ok but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of japanese culture or kept the story in the states .
