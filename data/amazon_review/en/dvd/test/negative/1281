zombies with obfuscate last night i watched the gates of hell , aka city of the living dead . it 's an italian horror flick made by lucio fulci . fulci may be best known for his movie zombie ! in which an eyeball is pierced in slow-motion by a sliver of wood , and in which a zombie battles a great white shark ( with predictable results ) . personally , i find fulci 's movies confusing , boring ( aside from a few key scenes ) , and just plain bad . the cut scenes are abrupt and often make no sense . the `` good '' scenes in the gates of hell include a drill press to bob 's head , and a teenager puking up all her internal organs . the movie is set in new england , which makes the recurring howler monkey sound effects entertaining . and when the dead all awaken , the sound effect is of crinkling cellophane layered over howler monkeys , which makes a lot of sense when you think about it . or not
