let 's make this short and sweet ... this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen . i knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way i was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing . i was right ; i fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it . recently , i was offered the chance to watch it again . i thought , `` ok , i did n't see the whole thing , it might have gotten better , so i 'll give it another chance . '' ... bad mistake . this little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long . hidalgo is the name of the horse . so what ? that 's about as boring as this movie . so why the 1-star markup ? cause the main character is played by viggo mortensen , of aragorn fame in the smash movie series the lord of the rings- and i do like viggo . i did not , however , like this movie . it 's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that 's exactly where this movie should be buried , never to bore another wave of audiences again . if you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap , watch hidalgo ; you 'll be out in no time
