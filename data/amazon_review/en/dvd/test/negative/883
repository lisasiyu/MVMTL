so disappointed i did n't think i 'd miss the christopher reeve superman movies ( one and two at least ) and i really miss george reeves now ! ! ! ! those black and white superman shows were the best ! what 's her name was a horrible lois lane ! ! ! ! the whole thing sucked - that was the second of two bad movies in a row ! i do n't even care about the deleted scenes ! i want to sell it to someone else or at the very least - i 'm going to give this one away ! brandon is cute enough but that uniform was soooooo dull ! ! i remember now that my brother told me i could wait for cable . i got greedy - someone bought him a dvd that was coded for another country ( there was russian writing on it ) and it would n't work in my dvd player so i got amazon happy and ordered it from a vendor in brooklyn . i shoulda waited for cable
