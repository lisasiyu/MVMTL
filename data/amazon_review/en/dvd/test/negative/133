ugh ! i got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development . my baby watched about two mintues and was gone . i think this is pitched as a baby video but it 's really more geared toward older children . none of the elements have anything to do with the music , making is virtually useless as a learning development product . i give it a big `` thumbs down '' . try any one of the baby faith products like god made me , god made music and god made animals . they 're awesome !
