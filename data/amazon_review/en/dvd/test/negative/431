good intentions , plodding drama **1/2 if `` north country '' did n't say that it was set in 1989 , you 'd never believe it based on the attitudes and behavior of its male characters , which can only be classified as `` neanderthal '' ( though that might be an insult to neanderthals ) . and , indeed , you would be right not to believe it , for the events on which the film is based actually began in 1975 , a full decade and a half before the time of the movie . the drama seems to have been moved forward in time to accommodate footage of the clarence thomas senate hearings of 1991 - images that play continually in the background as some sort of running commentary on the foreground action of the movie . it 's a sleight-of-hand maneuver that does n't do much to enhance the verisimilitude of the movie . with charlize theron once again ugly-ing herself up for great drama , `` north country '' tells the true but highly fictionalized story of lois jensen ( here referred to as josie aimes ) , a battered welfare mother with two children who takes a job in a northern minnesota steel mine , only to find it to be a veritable hell hole of unbridled misogyny and sexual harassment . here are guys who are so chauvinistic in their view and treatment of women that they make henry higgins look like alan alda in comparison . when she attempts to take a stand against the outrages perpetrated against her and the other women there , aimes finds little support from either the bigwigs at the plant , the unenlightened townsfolk , or even her own female co-workers who have been terrorized into silence in order to keep their jobs . eventually , she manages to file a class action lawsuit against the mine ( in 1988 , actually , a full three years before the clarence thomas/anita hill spectacle ) , resulting in a landmark decision for sexual harassment laws around the country . there is no doubt that the issue of gender equity in the workplace is a serious and important one , but `` north country '' feels strangely out-of-date and lacking in vitality in an age in which sexual harassment laws have become common place in the business world ( yes , i realize that this film is showing us how such laws eventually came to be , but that still doesn`t make it a fresh topic for a contemporary movie ) . moreover , `` north country '' ca n't quite shake that air of stultifying self-importance that too often infuses dramas dealing with serious social issues . as a result , the film is often plodding in its pacing and obvious in its theme , with the characters falling a bit too neatly into hero , villain and victim molds with very little shading in between . despite its good intentions and its being based on a true story , the film is riddled with push button feel-good moments and implausible instant conversions - and damned if the whole thing does n't have the look and feel of a lifetime original movie , just with higher priced stars in its cast ( frances mcdormand , woody harrelson , sissy spacek , and richard jenkins , the dead father from `` six feet under '' ) . and while the acting is decent , the suffocating nature of the drama inhibits most of the performers from breaking out and really having a go at their characters . perhaps it 's just that after movies like `` norma rae , '' `` silkwood , '' and `` erin brockovich , '' which could really make one care about the people and the issues they raised , `` north country '' comes up a day late and a dollar short in the i-am-woman-hear-me-roar department .
