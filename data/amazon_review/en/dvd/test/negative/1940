disappointing these bean cartoons are to comedy what cardboard is to cookies . the humour found in identifying with the live mr. bean is lost in simple crude cartooning and wishy-washy colors . not even the occasional grunt from atkinson brings these boring drawings and predictable story-lines to life . not watchable , even by great fans of bean or by children
