avoid this movie- ! this has got to be the worst film version of an austin story i 've ever seen . the plot is only tenuously connected with the book ; as for the characters , hairstyles & costumes , it should be subtitled `` fellini does austin '' because it most closely resembles the `` satyricon '' imo . the makeup , costuming , & hair on all the characters is not only not even close to reasonably accurate historically , but downright grotesque & bizarre - and that 's just the lead character , catherine . the rest are worse . bad acting , too . very lame film . the austin estate should sue bbc for turning out such a turkey & using her name
