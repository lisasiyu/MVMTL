disappointed in this dvd i thoroughly enjoy salsa , and enjoy learning from dvd 's and tapes . the title and reviews of this product suggest one will learn great things about this lovely dance . unfortunately , it is not clearly stated that this is for salsa rueda , not salon style or club salsa . although the moves are nifty and presented in a reasonable fashion , rueda requires the expected step to be called out , somewhat in the latin version of square dancing . so if you are looking to turn your date around the floor in your own style , leading with non verbal ques , this is not your dvd .
