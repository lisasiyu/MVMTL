this movie makes a 70 's geology documentary look good geez , with all the remakes of old horror flicks these days , i 'm losing faith in horror films altogether . this movie goes to prove a point that horror movie creativity is headed south . the plot sucked , the acting was predictable and the pulse was about as dull as the script itself . i 'm a fan of the blair witch mainly because it struck a chord of truth despite it 's overly abundant attempt to be true , but the brothers who made that film wasted their budget on this junk . there are no doubt kids in grade school that can conjour up better ideas , create more realistic suspense and drive you insane with terror . but these days , horror directors fall back on old ideas , stale scripts with added gore and one or two decent actors , in hopes that their ship might sail , bringing in a budget that will carry them over until a newer , fresher idea surfaces . give me your budget , throw in the towel and let me scare the s # $ t out of you , because if movies like these are all you have to offer up , then the genre of horror has a fate sealed in doom
