problem with ordering i loved angel heart . i ordered the unrated ( x ) version from a seller who works with amazon . i received the r rated version . i then ordered the special edition from amazon directly which stated it was the unrated version . however , it was also rated r. it looks like i will have to buy it here locally . the movie was excellent and i would recommend it to anyone . if you are going to buy it from either a seller or amazon , make sure you are getting the correct version
