did i miss something here ? i am a great fan of bernstein 's `` candide '' . i saw the 1974 production twice . my wife saw it three times -- she took a friend once . this dvd should have been an excellent performance . lupone and chenowith after all , but the dvd copy i have has such abysmal sound that any enjoyment of the performance is near impossible . muddy , echoing , not really even a clear visual image . i assumed it was a really bad recording job . is it just that i have a bad dvd copy ?
