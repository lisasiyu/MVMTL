torn this movie is good , if you do not think of the traditional arthurian story . but , unfortunately , to those of us who like the original arthurian story , this is really a bad movie . also , richard gere 's character fits his real life attitude and so he really did n't have to act in this movie ... . do n't get me wrong , i love the movie , as a movie , but , it has little to do with the king arthur legend ... much like the more recent movie about king arthur . because of this , it is a major let down to real arthurian lovers ... ... so , i am torn between giving it 4 stars for being a fun and exciting movie and giving it a negative 4 stars for letting us true arthurian buffs down ... .. so , i will give it a 2 star rating ...
