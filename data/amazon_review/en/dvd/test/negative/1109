shame on showzen for an incredibly amazing , hilarious show , it is a shame that something that is normally closed-captioned when aired on television is not really captioned when released to dvd . amazon says it is closed captioned , but there is nothing on the dvd box that indicates it is . using this information , i went ahead and purchased it anyway , only to find out it was not at all . who is really at fault i do n't know , and yes i am definately bitter
