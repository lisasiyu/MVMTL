this film was not faithful to the adaptation of the novel . there 's lots of passion in wide sargasso sea the book , but it 's mostly emotional . it 's an extremely multi-layered novel and the work of a true master . the film on the other hand is just your classic , bad 1990s film , beautiful to look at , with lots of skin , languid copulation , heaving bosoms , bodice-ripping nonsense , etc and next to no substance . it has no artistic integrity whatsoever , as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the jean rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did . i was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character . the much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe , and it also lacked much enthusiasm . they were incomplete and contributed little , if anything , to the plot . the viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between edward and antoinette . therefore , they should have either gone all the way , tastefully ( no pun intended ) , or have left those scenes out entirely . now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes , which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book . but for those who have n't read the book , there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat . from the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family ( despite the narration ) . why did the ex-slaves keep laughing ? ( something vaguely explained in the movie , though apparently fully explained in the book ) . why did n't the parrot fly away ? what made the mother go nuts ? at no point in the movie were mr. rochester 's `` issues '' , as it were , fully explained . the man gets a letter exposing his wife as a creole and dumps her like a hot potato , after ( as christophene explains ) he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place . what a hypocrite . again , maybe this is the ultimate point , that mr. rochester is a snob and the archetypical victorian englishman and that antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the jamaicans . but none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film . so , despite the beautiful cinematography , this movie is a hopeless muddle . i 'd highly recommend the novel by the way : a book you do n't forget in a hurry . needless to say i think you should give this insulting ( to the memory of jean rhys ) film a miss , especially if you 've read the novel : it 'll just frustrate you , no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time .
