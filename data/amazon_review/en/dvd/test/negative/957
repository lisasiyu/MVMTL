film noir in living color i find it insulting that not only does the woman like the guy for treatign her like garbage , being rude , insulting , and abusive , but she likes it , and still sees him after he nearly rapes her . that sort of thing sends a bad message . real men do n't behave that way -- only inferior males with severe psychological damage . seems all the characters in this movie are messed up . colin farrel 's character was teased as a child for being italian , so now he 's a mysogynist bigot . selma hayek 's character is mexican , ca n't read english , so she 's willing to but up with physical and mental abuse , and has tb , possiblly from her bartender friend . the bartender definately has tb , and wants to be a writer , just like everyone living in los angeles . donald sutherland 's character is a drunk . he has about 10 minutes of screen time . there 's another woman who is badly burned ( no information is given on how this happened ) over a large portion of her body . this causes her to latch onto various passing males with a fierce attachment that borders on psychotic . of the characters , she probablly has the best explanation for being messed up , though the form the writer took to show it is dubious . and there are two scenes which could have been totally cut from the movie without any loss to the story . there 's a nude midnight swim in the freezing cold ocean . and of course , there 's the prolonged bare-backside sex scene , where the camera seems fascinated with every pore and folicle in colin ferral 's glutious maximus . the story does n't really move , and the resolution does n't satisfy . while pretty , the attempt to capture the period is ultimately unsuccessful . and the earthquake scene is so stupid and poorly executed that the thing is laughable . between this movie , tigerland , phonebooth , and alexander , i have to wonder how colin ferrel ever got a career started . it certainly was n't based on acting tallent . seems to have more to do with his willingness to have his bare posterior on film
