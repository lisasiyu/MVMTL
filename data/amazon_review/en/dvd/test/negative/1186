one bad , one average episode ! as the 3rd and final season quickly comes to an end , i 'm left unsurprised that classic trek got axed at this season 's end . after a long string of poor and uninspiring episodes ( where had all the great scriptwriters gone after the first two seasons ? ) this volume is just the next installment of forgettable drivel . the first episode is just very , very poor with terrible scriptwriting and spock is inexplicably made out to be some obnoxious old maid with pms . the overall dialogue is very poor and the story is just plain stupid . why would n't a force strong enough to send the enterprise 1000 light years away just simply destroy the enterprise right away instead of playing games with the crew is unexplained . why would the computer have to make replicas of lee meriwether specifically for individual crew members without being able to kill at will is another ridiculous failing of the plot . i can safely say that this episode `` that which survives '' is one of the worst 3 episodes in the entire classic trekdom . the second episode is an interesting fable about racial discrimination and intolerance which pricks the conscience and successfully achieves its intention of provoking discomfort among its viewers to look at themselves to see if they are guilty of similar actions themselves . the script is quite good and the acting is good as well and not as bad as the other reviewers have made it out to be . this episode ranks among the better ones of season 3 as well . overall , we have one horribly bad and one average episode putting this volume under the `` give it a miss '' category if you are deciding which volumes to collect .
