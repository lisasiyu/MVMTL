watered down unanswered questions i unfortunately bought 4 of the ramtha dvds at the same time.. this was the best of them.. the others were pure wastes of money . while this one didnt answer many questions and ramtha takes forever to make a point . if you 've seen `` what the bleep '' dont waste your time or money on these ramtha dvds .
