disappointed by quality and images i purchased video for my 14 month old and was really disappointed by this video . first , it claimed to tell the story of noah 's ark but it was just a bunch of random images loosely tied with a few quotes about noah . my daughter watched the video half-way though ( which is not so bad ) but in general , prefers baby noah by baby einstein and noah 's ark by baby miracle . while the video has a few pretty images , i do not recommend it . hope my review is helpful .
