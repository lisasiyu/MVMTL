typical errors like so many things produced and published about the third reich , there is an all too familiar error here . it 's in the amazon product description . the waffen ss were not ( ! ! ! ! ) the `` black clad '' men . that was the algemeine ss . the waffen ss were the actual military branch of the ss and were ( still are ) recognized and some of the best trained and fighting soldiers in military history . the `` black clad '' alegemeine is what made up the infamous gestapo , hitler 's personal bodyguard , the sd and most of the internal ss force in germany and the occupied territories . the regular army panzer troops wore the black uniforms , but they were not part of the ss . the waffen ss wore the field gray and camouflaged uniforms . yes , they were brutal , and some were part of some `` questionable '' activities in the war . but , they were not what most people think of the ss , which is the gestapo . this error is about as common as authors , directors , etc . calling the german army , the nazi army or calling the luftwaffe the nazi air force . most german soldiers were not nazis . yes , their government leaders , for the most part , were nazis , but not the soldiers . i 've even seen some people say , nazi tanks ! ! i was not aware that a tiger tank could belong to a political party ! if amazon can not get this correct in their description , what is the point of watching something like this ? do your research . do not believe everything that is produced , especially by us writers or directors . remember , the winners write the history . english and french produced material is more accurate and more evenly presented . i find that ironic as they were the ones being bombed and invaded . not the us ! !
