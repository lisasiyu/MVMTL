great to learn about yuppies i should have known this movie would be terrible because it stars matthew mcconaughey . mcconaughey plays one thing well - the smarmy yuppie . having grown up in a working class manhattan family , i know the type well . he does an excellent job at this one role for which he is type cast again and again . this film is no exception . the worst thing about this movie is that even though i only watched about 2/3 , i had to use grease-cutting cleaner to clean my tv screen free of all the slime .
