it 's about kids at a `` musical camp '' for wannabe performers these are not your typical teens . they love broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage . so here they are at `` camp ovation '' honing their skills . one of the teachers is a song songwriter . because he is also a `` one hit wonder '' he 's an angry alcoholic . the other characters ( teenagers ) are a `` fag hag '' , a cross dresser , a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut , a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem . there is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie . if you like musicals , you will proberly like this but might bore most people .
