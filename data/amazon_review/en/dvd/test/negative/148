dumbest movie ever the entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched , it is actually completely false . the concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with whom is murdered ( or is otherwise the victim ) , but what you did , in distinct criminal incidents . even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone , if you go back and murder them `` again '' then that is a new incident , and double jeopardy does not apply . in movies intended to be fantastic , diverging this much from reality might be ok . but this is a mainstream legal thriller . it 's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women do n't , for no apparent reason . but the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means , or they just ( accurately ) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is
