take a little thx-1138 , add some logan 's run ... oh , and michael bay ... what do you get ? well , a lawsuit for plagiarism , but that is n't what i 'm going to talk about here . the island started pretty well . production design was great . the story was intriguing . very nice job of introducing questionable elements into the 'perfect society ' . i thought michael bay was going to surprise me . the product placement was irritating and cheesy , but i could live with it . while the writing was pretty corny , it was still nice to see michael bay trying something a little different for him . something smarter . but once our heroes escape , the movie nosedives . it felt like two completely different movies were tacked together . as i said , i was enjoying the beginning . the survivors of an unspecified `` contamination '' dwell within a sterile , self-contained city . their happiness and well being is paramount to those in charge . they are watched over and coddled . they have no real concerns . they live a life of leisure while holding out hope that they will be the next lottery winner , which promises them a one-way trip to the island , the last uncontaminated place on earth . once you discover the truth , the rest of the movie degrades to non-stop car and foot chases . explosions , shattered glass and twisted metal and lots of running and yelling fill out the last hour and a half or so . i 'm all for action movies . loved die hard and many schwarzenegger movies . it 's that the over-the-top action seemed so out of place with this particular story . it seems to me that if i was the head of a company and its ' future was up in the air because some damaging information was stolen , i would n't think that the best solution would be to send a heavily armed militia through crowded downtown los angeles to retrieve it . for the story that was being told , some hitchcock style suspense would have worked much better . like i said , the start was promising . then the movie switched gears . after about an hour i was just wishing the movie would end already . i 've read that this is michael bay 's best movie yet . that may be , but it sure does n't say much for him as a director . i 've just found out that this movie was plagiarized from 'the clonus horror ' . that one got the mst3k treatment , but i 'm betting that i 'll still enjoy it more than this movie
