the nostalgia is finer than the reality . i bought this out of a desire to reconnect with my childhood . blackstar was one of those shows i warmly recall getting up early on saturday mornings to watch . having watched the episodes again 25+ years later , i find them a little nostalgic ... and more than a little annoying , to be honest . the music is ultra-cheesy , as are the sound effects , the dialogue , the animation , the characters , and the plot . on the upside , my five-year old son seems to like them , and there is a sense of satisfaction that he enjoys the same sort of thing i did when i was young . my advice , buy the dvd for children under the age of 10 , but do n't buy them for yourself ... .just cling , cling like mad to your fond childhood memories of the show
