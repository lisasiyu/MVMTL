one lead too many makes for a dull movie . i enjoy jackie chan 's films but this was an exception . it would have been fine to have cast this movie with just jackie chan and fann wong . these two actors were great as a team . adding owen wilson to the mix was unnecessary and spoiled an otherwise excellent plot . when he was n't tedious , wilson was boring . why was he even cast in this film ? this was a movie i wo n't be in a hurry to see again
