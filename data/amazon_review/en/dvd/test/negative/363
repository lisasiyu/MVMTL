how did platoon miss the cut ? one would have to be a glutton for punishment to sit through this many oliver stone movies in a row . but , i see stone is artfully packaging himself these days now that he has nothing new to offer , unless you count his homage to fidel castro . the only movies worth watching are his early movies , salvador and platoon , which for some reason did n't make the cut . instead , you have the insufferable born on the fourth july and his conspiracy theories on the death of jfk , with a whole lot of filler in between
