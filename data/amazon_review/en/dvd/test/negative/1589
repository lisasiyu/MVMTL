a colorful yet disappointing attempt to capture doyle 's idea the color and cgi 's are excellent in this film . the location shots are great , and the attempt to capture the late 1880 's successful . however , the female character is obnoxious and certainly un- becoming in attitude , language and appearance . while this might be the 90 's , and women should be able to handle strong lead characters , this woman , who was the financial backer of the expedition , was disgusting . there have been several major cinematic attempts at this story , but this version leaves a lot to be desired
