a ( very ) poor man 's `` scream '' featuring george clooney in an early role and maureen mccormick ( marcia marcia *marcia* brady ) in a comeback role , of sorts . also featuring a confusing metafictional plot , flat humor , and mostly bad acting . `` return '' is yet another slasher-movie-about-slasher-movies . there were several of them made during the eighties , most of which now claim to have been the inspiration for `` scream . '' none of them were as good as that movie , however , and `` return '' is no exception . although the movie has its moments -- a scene of a cop creeping down a murky hallway whereabouts the killer may be lurking is tense -- there are n't enough of them to sustain the proceedings . if you watch just to see clooney and mccormick , be forewarned that the former gets bumped off early ( first , in fact ) , and despite a valiant effort mccormick 's cop who gets turned on by all the carnage is a joke that just does n't work
