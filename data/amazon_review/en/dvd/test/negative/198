welles has lost it orson welles was a master of film . but not this film . while i appreciate the message he is trying to convey , his `` cleverness '' is off the deep end . this film is like a big ego-trip for welles . he 's so proud of how clever he is . but the film is a mess , like paranoid , disjointed ramblings . in his younger days he would have executed this with a more subtle style . clever is most clever when it is not obvious . in this film he beats you over the head with the `` subtext '' and thinks he 's cleverly deceptive by trying to hide it in a jumbled-up the story line . i 'm sorry i wasted my time to watch it . i would have turned it off , but given my high respect for welles , i continued , expecting a revelation or twist . alas , no , it was just a stupid movie
