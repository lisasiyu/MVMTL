another teen movie , by adults , that hates kids . never mind 's that it 's pretty stupid - `` john tucker must die , '' like a lot of movies about high-schoolers , actually hates high school and just about everybody in it , and by extension , american kids ; it 's the kind of movie that , if parents caught an hour of it , would make them think less of their children for watching it , and to a fearsome extent , pretending to live it out . early in the movie one character , a cheerleader , remarks about stealing her mother 's estrogen pills : `` well , guys use steroids to build their pecs . '' that estrogen will do the same for the cheerleader 's breasts is laughable , but considering the hot debate of steroid use among kids - considering kids have died or flown into abusive rages while using them - that could be most casual , sickening line of the year . but it is what to expect from hollywood screenwriters in their 30s who write exploitative trash for money then have the artistic gall to call it mild , girlie comedy - not unlike those fabulous `` laguna beach '' hacks who use insidious , and i mean insidious , editing techniques to create faux docudrama among teens with facial expressions and confused responses clearly mismatched , again and again in the sloppiest manner , to the previous line of dialogue . `` jtmd '' asks us to believe that the title character ( jesse metcalf ) simultaneously dates three women ( ashanti , sophia bush , arielle kebbel ) without them knowing it , is able to afford repeated dinners at the nicest restaurant in town , owns a great car , stays in four-star hotels for high-school basketball road games , and my personal favorite , owns and drives a yacht . he and his brother have no parents to speak of . neither do the three girls , unless you count the cheerleader 's mom reference . one of them ( bush ) is an avowed 17-year-old vegan vixen , however . and when they discover they 've all been dating the same guy in gym class , they get in a brawl and are not suspended , but sent to a 23-minute detention without a teacher . is this a satire , as `` jtmd '' bills itself ? an edgy comedy ? a smarter , cleverer film knows that teachers hand out discipline , in this post-columbine world , for looking at each other funny , and that a brawl would constitute the lead story in the six o'clock news . a cleverer film has the girls chase not a superstar athlete , but , say head of the drama club . a cleverer film recognizes teen humor is mined not out of blase , ultra-hardened brat girls , but sweet , emotional , sunny girls . a cleverer film would know a dark comedy , if that 's what `` jtmd '' intends to be , ca n't have cheesy lines and yachts sitting around to be driven . instead we have a fourth , `` smart '' girl ( brittany snow ) is introduced as the girls ' grand , `` taming of the shrew '' plan to woo john and eventually stomp his heart . this angel , of course , begins to fall for john , who is not particularly charming or interesting or anything beyond possessive and very wealthy , which are , if we follow our mtv , two of the trinity ( the last being sheer , drop-dead cuteness emanating from those soulful eyes said guys must have , preferably brown ) that makes up male desirability . director betty thomas pretends that humor are four very different idiots insulting each other over the cliques they belong to . ashanti gets the shortest end of the stick , adhering fiercely to the idea that cheerleading , in an empowered , open society that has a foreign hindu woman as ceo of pepsi , represents the canopy of female of achievement . go figure - you break the glass ceiling with a cheer pyramid ! we 've been pounding this earth for years now . why do teens and young women still trail along , lapping it up ? there is no real wit in the movie that you ca n't see from some third-rate comic being fed lines on a vh1 program , no style , no genuine attitude . it 's all buried behind this driving notion of painting a portrait of a catty , young , rotten , unidealistic america most interested in getting tail , getting even and throwing s-uh-weet hoopty-rah parties . it is not immoral so much as it blank , a double zero signififying an unceasing period of meaningless motions to mimic , most involving self-debasement of young bodies . what fools hollywood sees our children to be , wants them to be . what numb , donkey fools . if you need more proof , jenny mccarthy has been cast as the voice of reason - and she 's borderline believable . ya know , so much ugliness is spewed about `` islamofascists , '' these manaical , stoneaged fiends who apparently ca n't tell you the sky is blue , spending most of their time taping martyr videos , finding mecca and concocting devices to destroy our way of life . consider , though , that one of the more recognizable items in muslim countries is the satellite dish . a year from now , this thing 's on a movie channel , and well , whatever evidence terroritsts thought they needed to chart the american decline into shame , they 've got it . not because it 's absent morals , but humanity - the better for the terrorists to treat us as the faceless collateral damage they believe us to be .
