no closed captions ! the film i bought at a retail outlet in spokane wa contains no closed captions ! if i had known that , i would n't have bought it . the box should have contained a clear message : no closed captions ! ( parenthetically , amazon.com 's description indicates the film is closed captioned . ) the content of the film is shallow , and it does n't really address the issues raised in the more fully supported greenwald film , walmart , the high cost of low price . if closed captions are not an issue , however , buy ( or rent ) *both* films to draw your own conclusion . obviously , the truth about walmart 's impact on us cities and third world communities is somewhere between the images presented in these two films . i found the greenwald film much more convincing
