a big disappointment i was hoping that the 2nd season would be an improvement from the 1st season , but sadly it is not . i am a major batman fan and grew up on batman : the animated series , batman/superman adventures , batman beyond , and justice league . the previous cartoons had great scripts and in depth charactors that made it exciting to watch ... .i am finding that i am going off topic . the batman is not the cartoon for die hard fans of batman over the age of 3 . the show is written for a much younger audience that does not need a captivating script and deep charactors . instead this show focuses on the action sequences and way too many witty comebacks . i have to say this , but what the heck is the penguin doing when he is fighting batman ? has he traveled the world and studied numerous martial arts ? since when can he jump from tree branch to tree branch and swing around and kick batman
