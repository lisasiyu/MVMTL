subtitles cut off if you speak french this dvd is probably fine - but for me there are better dvd 's that focus on a dancer 's life in a ballet company . the subtitles were cut off at the bottom and on the sides so you either looked at the dvd without knowing what was being said or you struggled to figure out the subtitles since they were only partially shown .
