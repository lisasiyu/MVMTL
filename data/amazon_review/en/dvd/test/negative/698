i have got two words to descibes what i thought of this ... and that is boring and snobish ! i watched the first two hours of this and coud n't keep awake . the narritor 's voice was monotone . i wanted to shout at his pompous , snobish demeanor shut up ! ! in my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god 's peoples . with the narritor , granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko . when you take people on a educating journey ( such as nine hours long ) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home . i felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like i was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours . i am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this dvd set back to the library and saying `` check please '' .
