messed with the original vhs release , made it worse loren michels ruins most things he touches . they left out the `` hot tub '' sketch , where eddie play 's as the late , great james brown . it may be one of the most funny sketches in the history of television ! ! ! ! i could see that thing 100 times and i would still laugh as hard as the first time seeing it ! i stand buy the greatness of that sketch , snl was riding the eddie murphy thing all the way to the bank ( the show would most likley been canceled , in my opinion , the show was unwatchable without him an piscapo teamed up ) . then to make this thing worse is that the vhs version had zero gumby sketches in it ( still great without it thought ) . i see they have a gumby sketch in the dvd version , i think `` oh , cool , a gumby dammit segment '' , but it ends up being one of the lamest one 's around . what , they did n't want to pay piscapo the royalties for showing the one where gumby goes on letterman ( piscapo as letterman ) ? do everyone a favor and do n't purchase this watered down version ... .delirious just came out . get that instead . that is garunteed to make u laugh ! this dvd ... .meeeeh !
