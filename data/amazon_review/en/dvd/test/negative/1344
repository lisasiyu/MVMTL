the foyle hunk i 'd like to give this period tv series higher marks ; i love michael kitchen 's wonderfully sympathetic portrayal of detective chief superintendent christopher foyle , and honeysuckle weeks as women 's auxiliary driver `` sam '' stewart is delightful . their interplay really makes the show . it just is n't enough ( for me ) to compensate for many major shortcomings . as other reviewers have pointed out , the show weaves contemporary ( early wwii ) social issues into its plots . not a bad idea - but handled in such a preachy way here as to be extremely off-putting . why is it wrong for non-essential civilian personnel to live outside the bombing area ? apparently it 's wrong when they rent rooms but ok when they sleep in their cars ? ! ? worst of all is foyle 's out-of-character sermonizing , which sometimes takes weird turns , as in the episode where he tells a justice-evading murderer that he 'll be on his case when the war 's over . not only does this make no sense in view of foyle 's previous instructions , but i interpret the capitalist villain 's bemused expression to mean `` thanks for the tip , copper , i 'll be getting off this flight in extradition-free ireland ! ! ! '' d'oh ! well , carry on , inspector ! the show 's designers are also a bit careless with physical period details . usually this is pretty minor stuff , but at least once produces a howler . in the fifty_ships episode , after a lengthy sermon on the crucial importance of not queering a deal to get the first shipment of u.s. military equipment ( 'even though it 's just moldy american rubbish ' ) , we spend the next five minutes of the show looking at a u.s.-made c-47 ( cutting edge in 1940 ) in raf colours ! ! ! as other reviewers have also pointed out , the stories are relentlessly pc . i have no problem with the courage of closeted gays in the services ; i 'm sure that 's true of all armies . but after seeing the umpteenth evil businessman , prejudiced patriot , and cowardly bourgeois i switched to sherlock ! the unforgivable sin , however , is the cheesy plotting . it 's not just that it 's formulaic and predictable , but logic often gets twisted in pretzels to allow foyle to 'detect . ' do you mean to tell me that the police searched the garage but no one thought to look in that big tank until foyle pulled a columbo with the tea bag ? is there a gosford park near this police station ? in conclusion , there 're far superior brit and , yes , u.s. detective shows out there . if you like it pc try morse ; if you 're into period try poirot , wimsey , or the hickson marple . leave foyle unless you 're desperate
