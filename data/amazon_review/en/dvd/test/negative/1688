black bike week the dvd covers all of the bike week including cars , women , and bikes . you really dont hear the traffic sounds , or cars or people talking . the background sounds or people talking is over shadowed by continuous background tracks . when you do hear background sounds or people talking its hindered since the music audio is higher than the verbal or background tones . watchable , but not worth a dvd collection
