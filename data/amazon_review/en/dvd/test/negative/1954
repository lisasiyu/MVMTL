a post-modern revision of scooby-doo ... i just had the chance to watch this film , and i was pretty sickened by the approach the writers took to this material . apparently , someone felt that the classic `` mystery '' approach which the scooby-doo franchise had leaned on for the past several decades had grown stale , and so the writers and producers decided to throw away the formula which had made scooby-doo so popular , and re-cast this storyline into a cliche-ridden horror film more akin to `` night of the living dead '' . the writers go out of their way to mock the previous incarnations of the cartoon , pointing out time and again how all of the `` monsters '' which the scooby-gang had encountered in the past had been men in monster suits . on this outing , the monsters they meet have no tricks . they are real . real zombies , real ghosts , real voodoo priestesses . along with all this so-called 'realism ' are disturbing situations and terror , including graphic depictions of beheadings , torsos being ripped apart , and a scene where a group of peaceful farmers are herded into a crocodile-infested swamp by a bloodthirsty band of pirates , where they are eaten . it 's not shown , but the quick cut away leaves little to the imagination with all the off-screen screaming . in short , this is a serious mis-step in the scooby-doo mythos , with the scooby-gang at first cocky and assured that there are hidden wires or holographic projectors creating the monsters , only to grow more terrified and helpless as it 's revealed that the horrors are not created , but actual . the writer 's attempt to inject some educational value into the proceedings seems to be limited to indentifying the vast amounts of regional food that scooby and shaggy are constantly gorging themselves on . the insinuation that monsters like this are real is subversive and not appropriate for the age group that these cartoons are aimed at . not recommended , unless you 're an older viewer who 's curious about the whole `` what if '' factor involved . the animation and other factors are all good , for this kind of direct-to-video product , and there are some brief moments of winking humor that long-time fans will quickly pick up on
