terrible , but still fun ok , this movie stinks ! now that we have cleared that up , let 's take a look at why this movie should be watched . our story is about a post-apocalyptic world , in which the human race is forced to live undewrground ; in order to avoid contact with the radation that has killed life . as time goes on , two groups of survivors formed and did not get along . so , group 1 up and left and made for the earth 's surface again . this is where our movie starts . the group is a bunch of bikers and look like they came straight out of la , ca 1980 . as they are settling in , the discover that there is some sort of ultra-smart , ultra-fast , ultra-carnivous species of rats on earth and there are large numbers of them . very cheesey and not worth more that $ 9.50 or $ 10 , but definatly worth watching . and , to all those weiners about these being real rats , get over it ! there is this perfectly legal profession in the united states that i 'm sure you would call for assistance if you had a rat problem ... ..we call them exterminators ... ..what 's the difference ?
