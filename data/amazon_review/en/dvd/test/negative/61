a totally boring movie i terribly disappointed by this movie . it bears some resemblance to the bone collector and silence of the lamb , but has none of the suspense , mystery , good acting and good story that these other movies have . this lame excuse of a movie ended with with the killer appeared out of nowhere to confess his crime at the end . the cops were basically two idiots who could n't solve the crime on their own . add all the stupidities up and you have one boring movie .
