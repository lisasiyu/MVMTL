bottom of the barrel 'nightmare city ' aka 'city of the walking dead ' aka 'invasion of the atomic zombies ' ( by far the best title ) is pretty much the most reviled film of the european zombie cycle of the early 80 's . i do n't think this is entirely fair . personally , i think this movie is better than mattei 's 'hell of the living dead ' . but , that ai n't much of a prize , and this film is pretty damn lousy . but , it 's still worth seeing if you 're a zombie fan . so , as i always say , if you 've even heard of this movie , you 'll probably think seeing it is worth your time . in some ways this film is slightly better than average . the scenes not involving the zombies are relatively competent , perhaps slightly better than what you 'd usually get in this sorta film . none of the characters are remotely interesting , but the acting is not atrocious , if not good either , and the dialogue is rarely laughable . ( except for anna 's ridiculous , luddite social commentary . and that 's funny due to the content , rather than the delivery . ) the problem with this film is the zombies themselves . now , i 'm not a total zombie purist , but i ca n't call this a real zombie film . i do n't care that they run , and i do n't care that they are n't dead ( or maybe they are . i forget . do n't care either way . ) the problem is that they always use weapons and tools . now , it 's one thing to use these items sporadically , but they do it all the damn time . for the most part , these supposed zombies just run up and stab people . not very zombie like . furthermore , they just are n't animalistic enough . the fast zombies in '28 days later ' and the new 'dawn of the dead ' were at least wild and out of control . these ones just seem like murderous people with gunk on their heads . what it all comes down to is that these zombies are just lame . they look terrible , with just some ridiculous lumpy crusty crud on their heads , at best , or just some black goo . lame behavior and lame appearence= lame . i think if they'da made this with regular zombies it could 've been a middle of the road zombie pic , and if they had some decent gore . the gore in this is terrible , other than a few amusing exploding heads . it 's not especially gory for this sort of film either , though again , this is n't much of a loss considering the quality of it . there 's not too much else to say , it 's just a lotta angry zombies running around cutting people up . reasonably amusing , but not much more than that . the only really great moment is when a pack of zombies bursts in on an operation , and one surgeons flings a scalpel across the room and into one of the zombies necks . that was pretty sweet . yeah , that 's it . amusing , but just barely . grade : d
