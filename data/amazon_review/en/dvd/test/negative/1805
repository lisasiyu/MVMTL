living proof that tv personalities do n't belong onstage ! spare yourself this experience ! much as i adore gilbert & sullivan , and could even tolerate the hollywood squares quiz show once upon a time , i ca n't figure out why anyone thought peter marshall would be able to contribute to a g & s production . and sure enough , he could n't . in fact , his presence is one of the many downfalls of this production , which include mediocre choreography , a poorly designed set , unconvincing personalities , and some truly bizarre camera work . it 's difficult to even sit through this embarrassing production once . you 'll be better off catching a local amateur production .
