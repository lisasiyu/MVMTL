for jarheads i too was n't very impressed with jarhead . i thought half way through that jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the marines , and perhaps other branches of the military . for those of us who have n't i just do n't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested . as someone else mentione . i too thought it was going to be a more modern version of full metal jacket , but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't..
