this one deserves a big fat zero this has got to be one of the worst , most unrealistic movies to date . i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks -- rarely are they done well . this one , however , takes it to a whole new level . what was courtney love thinking ? ! you 'll regret wasting your money on this . i ca n't even fathom why it 's gotten decent reviews so far
