south park : the down years definitely rated five stars if your under the age of ten . adults beware . these guys have run out of ideas since the first season and are proceeding on the fumes from their fart jokes . i hope trey and parker make vast amounts of money to help pay for voice impersonation lessons . besides the smugness , i am tired of all the voices in south park sounding all too similar .
