i 'm a mamet fan , but this is probably his worst . i gave this movie every chance , but the story is slow , the acting is liveless ( ameche is the only one half-way decent ) , and the story turns out pointless . the ending doesn't really make any sense or have any impact , and the vagueness and indirection that is usually explained at some later point in mamet 's films is never clarified here . only watch if you 're a die-hard mamet fan so you can say at a dinner party , `` yes , i saw that one , and i agree it was bad ''
