great dvd my three year old loves this dvd and has discovered the joys of goofy , but ... why can you just set the dvd to play all ? the mickey collection you can just set it and forget it . this collection you must keep selecting the next cartoon ( it does not even default to the next cartoon ) . poor show disney
