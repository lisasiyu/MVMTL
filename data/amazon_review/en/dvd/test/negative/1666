watch your step ! i too was misled by these reviews , and i too am puzzled by the apparently sincere expressions of enthusiasm for this movie . maybe you have to be italian or lithuanian , but i watch a lot of real italian movies ( the ones with subtitles ) , and they are not like this . i think that dreyfus 's character was inconsistent . he acted like a sleaze , and then he acted like a great guy , totally sincere , etc . then he acted like a sleaze , flattering people , snowing them with gifts , etc . i simply think the screenwriter was trying for something he could n't bring off . similarly with the movie as a whole . this is not simply a feel-good family , although obviously the screenwriter was trying to paint such a family . there needed to be more interaction than the stereotyped hugs and such . something was missing . also , the story went nowhere . there was no plot , and very little story , and it lasted a long , long time . and the movie had nothing else to offer a viewer . i would say , be very , very careful before buying this movie . i do n't think it was overlooked . i think it was looked at and turned down .
