a propaganda film gone wrong . this review is for the criterion collection dvd edition of the film . barbet schroeder 's film , a `` self-portrait '' of the infamous ugandan dictator idi amin , generated much controversey and even death threats . idi amin himself demanded that schroeder remove particular scenes from the film under the threat of killing french citizens living in uganda . the film is well written but almost appears sympathetic to amin . the dvd only has an interview with director barbet schroeder for a special feature , although the liner notes contain a transcript of a letter amin write requesting the deletion of particular scenes . this film has significance , but is not a good one
