i wish i could go lower than this . this is horrendous movie . i will never claim it as the movie of my generation . it 's one of the many reasons why i absolutely hate the `` 80 's '' . the others are : breakdancing , the yuppie lifestyle , power hungry businessmen/women , women with manly handshakes , new wave music , and junk movies like this . i know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself , and what he can get out of life . he ridicules his friend because he 's sick , and does n't feel like driving ferris around ... especially in a ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage , so what am i left to believe i have to wonder if this is where ice cube got the inspiration for `` it was a good day '' . i do n't care what decade it was , or what was cool back then , or now manipulating your friends is `` not '' i repeat '' not '' cool . i know with john and johnette q . public this is something of a sexual relase . i could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie , and i find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny .
