strange `` movie '' ... .. a chemist ( brenda marshall ) working on a new anesthetic takes the product home and tries it out . her assistant ( hilary brooke ) , who may be after marshalls ' husband , arranges an `` accident '' that reults in marshalls ' face being disfigured . marshall then murders a woman trying to blackmail her over a previous car accident and has to go on the lam with the dead womans ' identity . she plots to take revenge and everything snowballs into a nightmare worse than before . the finale sees it all as just a weird hallucination she experienced from the drug . huh ? all this mumbo jumbo is played out in a very short running time . i would n't call this a `` movie '' so much as a cheap experimental student project . there are no production values at all . the sets are cardboard and the acting is dull and at times amateurish . i know that anthony mann has a reputation as a low budget film noirist but this is the cheapest attempt at telling a story i 've seen in a while . ulmer 's `` detour '' is pretty cheap but at least it 's interesting . this was interesting at first but the ending just left me flat . low budget is one thing but out and out cheap is another . i will not fault this films ' defenders . to each his or her own . but it 's just too cheap for me to see more than once . so it 's recommended for manns ' fans and others with their curiosity meter turned way up
