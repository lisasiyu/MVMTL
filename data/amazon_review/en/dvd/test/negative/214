back away from alice ! this movie should have won an oscar . the acting was superb . kate capshaw and elle mcpherson were so convincing as lesbians . their common interest of jazz and love for clubs composed of all butch lesbians , but them ( of course ) , is compelling drama unfolding before your eyes . the writing is amazing . the nonexistant plotline between them had me captivated and wanting more . stockard channing was aspiring as a pyschologist . she made me feel like i could go to her about any problem and she would solve it in an instant . the stoned looked in her eyes provided a security unmatched in real life . the twists and turns provided in the three sisters story was like a m night shyamalan movie . i wo n't say anything in fear of spoiling the ultimate surprise ! all in all i feel like this movie brought me to a state of complete bliss . with dialogue like two men saying ( ... ) over an over again and heartwarming original characters like alice or claire - a nontoken black maid and homophobic turned obsessive stalker jealous needy clingy apologetic friend - i feel like i should give up writing because nothing will top a masterpiece of this caliber
