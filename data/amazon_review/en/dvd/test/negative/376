dated home movie i predicted in 1994 that this cinematic flash-in-the-pan would n't stand the test of time . it was all the rage in 1994 and i still ca n't honestly tell why . with its painful -- - and i mean painful -- - bad acting and its relentless attempts to be hip and trendy , it seems to be little more than someone 's `` artsy '' home movie . i agree with the reviewer who finds it depressing to see lesbians frequently portrayed as unattractive , self-obsessed , women-children ... . that was big in the 1990s but i think it 's changing . ( in fairness to the film , i can also appreciate that go fish was attempting to portray a segment of society not air-brushed and blown dry . ) what makes this film ultimately fail , in my opinion , ( aside from the acting ) is that its story takes place in the vacuum of the 1990s young , urban lesbian ghetto . almost all of the characters ' issues , views and attitudes too narrowly reflect this tiny , specific demographic . there are a few crossover fans out there , but i ca n't imagine too many midwestern , middle-aged and/or rural lesbians will find much to which they can relate . as a lesbian friend of mine said at the time this film came out : `` why would i want to go see some grainy , black & white film about a bunch of lesbians whose lives do n't remotely resemble my own ? '' the normal answer to that question , of course , is : because it 's an interesting story with compelling characters . however , in the case of go fish , neither applies . there 's not much of a story and frankly , you could probably get your junior-high school niece and her friends to do a better job acting it . watching this film is like seeing someone 's 10 year-old home movies -- - bad cinema , bad entertainment .
