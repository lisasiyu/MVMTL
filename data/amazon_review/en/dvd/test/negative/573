i 'll be there ... but not for long there 's a reason why they talk about the `` voice of an angel '' -- it 's because charlotte church certainly does n't have the acting presence of one . her acting debut `` i 'll be there '' is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres , where it rapidly dropped out of sight . rightly so . seventeen years ago , paul kerr ( craig ferguson ) of the love rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert . fast forward to the present : kerr discovers that unknown to him , his ex rebecca ( jemma redgrave ) gave birth to a daughter , olivia ( charlotte church ) , who is now a well-adjusted paper girl . the problem is , olivia has been kept a secret from her dad . rebecca is embittered , but kerr wants to get to know his daughter , and similarly olivia wants to get to know her father . music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together , but rebecca does n't want her child to follow in her father 's footsteps . `` i 'll be there '' was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress liv tyler , who , despite being only in her twenties , has had an immensely interesting life . well , maybe someday she will get a biopic , because `` i 'll be there '' is only similar in one way : it involves a rock star and his daughter . otherwise , it is boring in about every way that tyler 's life is interesting . with a forgettable script , not much humor and a goofy premise , the movie does n't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager 's absurdist fantasy , scripted for church to act out . and not a terribly interesting teenager , either . it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides to pursue music to bond with daddy dearest ; it 's an obvious ploy to show off church 's vocal skills . the best that can be said of church 's performance is that at times she looks sweet . as for acting talent , she is bland at best , but she does perform some good songs , and her voice is as pretty as ever . just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes . redgrave does as good a job as she can , and ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker . his is the only memorable role in the film , and it 's a shame that the movie did n't focus on him rather than the dull miss church . miss church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the britney spears approach . `` i 'll be there , '' but i promise i 'll get out as soon as i can
