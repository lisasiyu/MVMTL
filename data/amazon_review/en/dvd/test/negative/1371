boring this video was very boring compared to the `` elmo 's world '' videos that my son loves . i guess if you are looking for something low key and relaxing for a baby to watch it is a good choice . it is not good for a baby who really loves fun music and action . my son was 10 months old when i played it and he was n't interested at all and neither was i . the song choices were dissapointing . it was tedious to sit through , but luckily at only 30 minutes long it was almost over before it started
