a film that you already seen before `` killing me softly '' has one of those scripts that just do n't give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation , but the big `` twist '' at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable ( unless perhaps you have n't seen a thriller before in your life ) . the chemistry between the two leads is also lacking ; fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned , he 's an inexpressive bloke , while heather graham is all too expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera . besides , she 's not even that attractive ; even her co-star in this particular film , natascha mcelhone , blows her out of the water in that department . the ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker ' candy in your mouth , sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour . it was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did , i have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly in spite of all that , chen kaige 's direction is good , and he creates some suspenseful moments . so i give the film a generous `` ** out of 5 '' rating . but if you 're a heather graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes ; and for joseph fiennes fans you 'll receive half naked perks .
