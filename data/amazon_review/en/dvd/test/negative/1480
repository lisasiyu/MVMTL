absolutely horrible as a sequel to a mega-hit movie this was a stinker . the thing i loved about the original was how it captured the late 50 's with music , custumes , and attitudes and yet this sequel seemed to fall flat on it 's face in all those categories . the songs are so out of place with lots of 80 's ish themes being played during certain scenes . the producer could n't even focus on one time period with the music which ranged from 50 's , 60 's , 70 's and even 80 's metal at one point . the mood and feel of the movie was wrecked by this alone , without including the fact that the songs themselves were utterly boring . one or two songs were ok , like `` reproduction '' and the biker song by michelle pfeiffer . if you buy this thinking it 's a real sequel to grease you are sadly mistaken . there 's not alot in common at all with the first movie other then a few characters and the `` t-birds '' and `` pink ladies '' . the plot is totally cheesy also . i 'm not sure what i hated worst , the fact that some of the hairstyles and music reminded me more of the 80 's or the predictable plot of the movie . `` fast times at ridgemont high '' , `` the breakfast club '' & `` sixteen candles '' are so much better movies at representing the 80 's if you are looking for a movie like that . the last thing i wish to see is a movie suposedly set in 1961 is for it to coming off in all respects to be 1982 . when i watch movies like this , i like to be transported back to a place in time and feel the period completely . unfortunately grease 2 leaves me wondering exactly what time period it was supposed to represent . the only saving grace of this movie is watching a young michelle pfeiffer with brown eyes instead of her usual and what i thought was her natural blue eyes
