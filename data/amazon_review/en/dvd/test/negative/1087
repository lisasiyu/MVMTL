jumbled i was n't expecting much from pulse , and with such low expectations , i was n't disappointed . it was everything a one- or two-star movie could hope to be . what i did find disappointing was that they had a good idea somewhere , but everyone working on the film , top down , seemed to miss it . then again , it was a remake of a japanese horror classic ( and japanese horror films rarely , if ever , make sense ) , so they were n't trying to find an original story . pity . in an otherwise quiet college town , the suicide rate is skyrocketing . eventually our heroes , mattie ( kristen bell ) and dexter ( ian somerhalder ) realize that there is a virus , of sorts , in `` the system '' , and odd , silvery specter-like creatures are the cause of it . these creatures , never explained , put themselves face-to-face with their victims and then it seems that they inhale and suck some essence from their victim , which feeds them - somehow . it makes for good viewing , but it does n't make much sense . and because it does n't make sense , we 're not `` creeped-out '' . since i 'm reviewing this as the dvd , and not the film , i 'm giving it two-stars - because for the first time that i can recall , the special features were subtitled . as i 'm hearing impaired , i normally miss out on the special features , and even though these special features were n't all that exciting , i was able to watch them .
