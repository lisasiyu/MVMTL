awful i was very disappointed in this movie . it had such cool cover art on the dvd that i took a chance and rented it - foolish move . it just is n't scary . it is a typical slasher type film , but with no scares , storyline , etc.. i watch many , many movies and can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the top 5 worst movies i 've seen . i highly recommend staying clear of this movie
