masterful nothingness hugh grant is not too offensive in this role . he is not too cutesy here , and that is something for which to be thankful . in the film grant 's character michael is engaged to marry gina , the daughter of an italian-american mobster ( played by james caan ) . michael is a successful auctioneer , and after his engagement to gina , gina 's father starts using michael and his connections to the art world to launder money . soon the fbi is onto the scheme ( with kids in the hall 's scott thompson as a particularly funny fbi officer ) . michael attempts to hide these dealings from gina ( michael of course did not want to get involved with all of this illicit activity in the first place but was railroaded-it is the mafia after all ) . when gina finds out their relationship crumbles . an accident causes even more problems , potentially fatal ones . overall this is not a great movie and not even particularly funny . however , you will be able to sit through it and maybe get some entertainment value from it
