french garbage this review may sound pretentious and ignorant , but in truth i 'm a big fan of british history , so bear with me ! even as a film itself , it 's surreal , and i do n't like the acting . but as with any historical film that includes the british , they 're made out to be the absolute bad guys ! sure we were forging an empire within france ( i.e . the hundred years war ) , but rapists and murdering pillagers ! ? never ! historically accurate , full of british sentiment , and down-right weird . avoid this film today , folks !
