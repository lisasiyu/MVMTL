i do n't care so much about the foul language . i 'm a big fan of the sopranos so obviously the f word does n't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the f word and mf . the stories and characters are superficial , boring and unintelligent . people who like this show are the same people who think that what makes the sopranos a great show is because people get `` whacked '' a lot .
