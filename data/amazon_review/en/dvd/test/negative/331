the book is fascinating ; the movie fails it . i 'm a retired attorney . i enjoy crime novels and the movies that bring them to us visually . however , this movie simply is a pain to watch , if one enjoyed the drama of the book . the book `` blood work '' is very detailed and the solution to the `` who done it '' is very well hidden . i wo n't bore you with details but if you want to know how the movie compares with the novel , read the review by `` km southern '' dated oct 19 , 2004 , that is available below . she is right on . the movie has so many flaws that even without having read the book upon which it purports to be based , it is a poor choice
