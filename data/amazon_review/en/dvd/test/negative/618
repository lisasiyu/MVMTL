what a horrible butcher job of a masterpiece ! ! ! ! ! so there i was ... ... browsing through amazon.com and on `` the page i made '' up pops , guess what ? triumph of the nerds on dvd . seeing this , i was just reaching for my credit card to snap up a copy of it when bam ! i read one of the reviews ... ... still a great show , but the ambrose edition is not complete ! , october 28 , 2004 reviewer : sean breazeal ( mt . pleasant , ut usa ) i immediately checked with bob , and yes , sure enough , several minutes had been cut from the original us release for `` space '' requirements . in his defense , bob had no input on this . were it me ? i 'd be hopping mad . instead of the publisher , ambrose , using this opportunity to create a new and valuable product by adding deleted scenes , extended version , and extras , they chose to go on the cheap and cut to fit rather than make a product worth purchasing . bob cringely is a genius and is thorough in all he does . had they used this chance to extend what was probably the best compilation of the modern 'net age and add what i 'm sure was hours of extra content bob had to cut , i 'd have been the first guy willing to pay retail to buy it . having purchased 3 copies of the boxed video set ( 1 lost to a fire , 1 lost to a non-returning friend ) there would have been no hesitation to this . in fact , i 'd have watched it straight through on receipt . what a horrible , horrible mistake ambrose has made . fix it ! ! ! ! do n't walk , run from this edition . i know it 's old school , but do yourself a favor and buy the video tape version . you 'll thank me later
