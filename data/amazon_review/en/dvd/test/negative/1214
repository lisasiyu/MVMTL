shallow & self-serving & disappointing . i can only agree with those other viewers who found major gaps & omissions in the `` documentary '' . no mention of michael ritchie or john boorman that i could see . but lots of footage of `` hot '' & `` trendy '' folks like mazursky , avildsen & hopper . even the bit of commentary from friedkin , altman & coppola that might have given this effort some real substance is too slight & superficial to matter . it 's stuff you 've read or heard a thousand times before . too bad . they really blew it
