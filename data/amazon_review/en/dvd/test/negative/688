dissapointing second season with some good moments overall i found the season to be a big bore . i am not a hugh fan and season 1 was pretty good but not great but i had to watch this season and will continue to watch the other season 's . the season started good but went downhill fast becouse nothing happend you can miss all season adn it will be right were you left off . there are good moments like the last few episodes were really good . overall not a great second season
