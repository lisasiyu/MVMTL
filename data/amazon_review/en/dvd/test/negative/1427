a pale imitation of an innovator i saw the show on stage . i saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this . unfortunately , this is ann reinking 's version of bob fosse . reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential fosse dancer of the 70 's and 80 's created this tribute . the difference is ann reinking has taken the fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own . as a tribute to fosse this is inaccurate . therefore , for fosse aficiandos this is not an acurate recreation but an interpretation of his works . also , there is a too big reliance on his concept musical `` dancin ' '' . the one good thing in this is the addition of another fosse creation ben vereen . he shows why he can still pack a house . my suggestion is to rent fosse films like sweet charity and all that jazz . you 'll get to see the real fosse
