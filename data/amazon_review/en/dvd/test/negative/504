cruel example of cultural imperialism at its worst : what about the kids i too was mesmerized by this documentary , as an educator and student of child psychology , etc . then i heard the running commentary , especially the remarks of the cameraman , and realized what a vile example of grotesque cultural imperialism this is : using despised children for selfish purposes=prostitution . the cameraman calls one of the children a whiny b # tch ( his words ) and has a rather obviously ambiguous relation with another of the girls . the inclusion of these comments and some of the stills casts a telling pall over the entire enterprise . often under the guise of doing good we exact greatest harm , as mr. oscar wilde noted . this despicable film takes kids , uses them and disposes of them with the sneering arrogant attitude so overtly and unselfconciously expressed in the commentary by the cameraman , divides families and friendships , exposes children to realizing painfully and traumatically their condition , like liza dolittle , without hope of going either back or forward . the pain on their faces as they observe the film is especially telling
