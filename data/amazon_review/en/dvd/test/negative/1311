defective recording this recording is simply defective . it opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording , and boy , they are not kidding ! this is not a simple case of vhs quality on a dvd . instead the video quality is comporable to the first live broadcast from the 1969 moon landing . and the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders , complete with pitch shifts.. it is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording . even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame . some example frames at vienneseball dot org slash pirates this is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance . i am immediately returning this to amazon . this recording should never have been released
