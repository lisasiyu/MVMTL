funny premise - unfunny film i was very disappointed with this film . the premise was really intriguing , with elvis switching places with an elvis impersonator who as we all know goes on to die at graceland leaving the real elvis to scratch out a living as - what else - an elvis `` impersonator . '' and now , at the end of the king 's life , he 's a semi-invalid in a nursing home being attacked by a killer zombie mummy . since it 's texas , the mummy has a more than passing resemblance to stevie ray vaughn . and oh , yeah , jfk is also in this nursing home , having inexplicably been transformed into ozzie davis . how can you miss with a setup like this ? well , for starters by assuming the premise is so funny there 's no real need to provide any additional comedy . the movie is flat , with very little humor . as other reviewers have noted , it moves at a glacial pace , even allowing for the protagonists being 80-somethings who do n't move like they used to . sure , the acting is several notches above the norm for a low budget film , but there 's no point in making a comdey that is n't funny . nice try , but booooooooooring . not at all recommended .
