not as pleasant as getting your wisdom teeth pulled . i really wanted to like this movie because i think the duff sisters are cute and actually have some potential . this movie has nothing about it to offer additional points to that train of thought . hilary and hayley are two spoiled brats who lose all their money , then get it back -- an obvious parody of the ditzola factor the hilton sisters live for real . about as painful , stupid and empty as my date with the president 's daughter ( ugh ! ) , the only redeeming thing about this vapid little teen chick flick is anjelica houston . for good teen flicks that are thoroughly enjoyable , i highly recommend 10 things i hate about you and the old 80s classic hit , john hughes ' sixteen candles . where this movie is concerned , i would n't recommend it to your dog 's fleas .
