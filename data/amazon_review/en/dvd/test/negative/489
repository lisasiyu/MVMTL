lousy dvd from hart sharp video this review refers to the uncut dvd version . like the other reviewers here , i loved this movie . the movie i would rate as 5 stars and it is indeed a stunning debut for the as yet unknown actress juliette marquis ( from ukraine no less ) . the image quality is not stellar as this was shot on digital video . i can undertand and accept that . this dvd however is a lousy pan and scan version . some movies can be pan and scanned relatively unscathed because their photographers deliberately shoot them with future tv transfers in mind . but this movie was shot by someone who makes full use of the widescreen aspect and did n't make room for transfer to fullscreen tv . it is intensely frustrating to watch this damned dvd . you watch noses talking to half faces , half faces talking to ears , heads bobbing in and out of frame repeatedly . i am furious at the studio a__holes at hart sharp video who sanctioned this pan and scan monstrosity . and they had the temerity to advertise on the back cover that it is in widescreen . to add insult to injury , they show pictures on the back cover and the insert , of screenshots in the original widescreen where you can compare the beautiful original compostion and the pan and scan cropped crap . hart sharp video goes straight to my list of never buy from again . by all means see this movie - at the theater . or wait till a more responsible company releases a new dvd edition
