dissappointingly shrill the edith wharton novel this movie was made from was beautifully written , sensitive and poetic . while this movie was visually appealing and faithfully rendered the story , the performances of gillian anderson and eric stoltz were painful to watch . ms. anderson especially , while a great beauty , so overdid her lines that i was reminded of high-school plays that i 've seen . for emotion or drama , she spoke moreloudly . her lines were raced through , and punctuated by strange words being stressed . and while she was trying to be distraught , or betrayed , or vulnerable , her face showed no emotion at all . a little bit of eye-brow raised , or pouting lips , but that was all . eric stoltz was little better . i could n't help feel that ms. anderson was out of her depth as an actress . bur mr. stoltz , who i 've seen in many good roles , was inexplicable . maybe it was the directing that failed them . this was so disappointing to me , as i had really wanted to enjoy it , and i had so enjoyed `` the age of innocence , '' with winona ryder , michelle pfeiffer , and daniel day-lewis . but this production , from a superior book , really fell short . i would recommend the pbs version , with geraldine chaplin , if it were in any way available
