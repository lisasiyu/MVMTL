stinks to high heaven ! ! ! ! ! this so called director should be sued . as a 30 something who loved the original every friday night from season 1 through 4 ( before coy and vance ) ... ..coy and vance look like gods compared to the cast of blasphemous characters to a classic and timeless show . first off ... .why was burt reynolds and not danny de vito casted as boss hogg ? why not chevy chase instead of an overweight villain known for playing a violent middleaged nut in `` breakdown '' and `` conair '' ... ( mc gainey ) ... mc ... you are a very good actor in your niche ... just not turning james best 's character upside down . i refused to see this in theaters and rented in ( regrettably ) even after hearing the derogatory reviews with an open mind.i can write a book about character mistakes and ruining the `` originals '' ... .but i 'll end it by saying the following to quote `` you took the name of a classic to sucker fans and boost ticket sales for what would have been a straight to video bomb if it was not titled `` dukes of hazzard .
