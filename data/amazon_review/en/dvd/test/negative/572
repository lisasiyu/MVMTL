what ? i ca n't believe how many great reviews this horrible film got . the acting is laughable as is the writing . there are also many mistakes and inaccuracies ! they depict the heroes as perfection and the enemy as monkeys . real life is n't like that . i guess just because this movie is pro-war people automatically back it up . but this is the worst movie i have ever seen .
