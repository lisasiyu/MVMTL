would n't buy it again this video covers several basic exercises you can do with an exercise ball . i do n't care for the woman who does it -- i find her personality a little annoying . that aside , there is no way to do the exercises straight through without title segues between each position . this makes for a long workout with too much rest between positions . it 's nice the first time through because you are just learning . but i would have preferred an option for a traditional style video without titles and intro descriptions for each position
