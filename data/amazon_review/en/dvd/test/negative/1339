does not work ! the dvd does not work in ireland so it is absolutely useless ! ! i should have been made aware of this when i was purchasing the product . i would like to be refunded in full for the three dvds i have purchased : my fair lady , paris when it sizzles and breakfast at tiffanys ( purchased at the same time ) also the packaging costs were not displayed until i had entered my credit card number and were much too expensive . overall i am extremely disappointed with my experience and i expect to be compensated for this
