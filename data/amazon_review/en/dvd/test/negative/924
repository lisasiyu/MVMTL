corregidor as a fan of world war 2 movies especially those made during the period 39/45 i must say that i thought the people who had this example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . i am all for old movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have found a better copy to sell , it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . dvd is supposed to be reasonable quality , this example is disgusting . to have the nerve to offer it for sale is unbeleivable
