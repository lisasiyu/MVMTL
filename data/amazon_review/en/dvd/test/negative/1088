a stinky turd my god , this is one sloppy mess of a movie . jet li should be ashamed of this putrid turd . even the great fight choreographer , cory yuen , can not escape being associated with this film untarnished . the story is dumb , but so what . the acting is dumb , but so what . the pathetic attempts at comedy fail abysmally , but so what . this is a martial arts film ; we watch these films for the fight scenes , right ? uh-huh . unfortunately , the fight scenes suck too , big time . the scene where jet takes on the ufc guys is embarrassingly bad , and the much anticipated fight between jet li and the great mark dacascos is a huge let down . someone needs to tell editors that cutting back and forth between several action scenes absolutely ruins the flow and impact of all of them ! ( this is the same bad decision that has ruined the climax of so many of the star wars films , but in this case , all of the action scenes going on are downright awful . ) further , dmx is just plain silly , and his nice-guy act in the film does not mesh with the meaning of the lyrics of his songs that accompany some of his character 's actions on screen . similarly , i wonder what jet would say about some of the lyrics to some of the crap rap songs in this film , such as the violent and hateful opening song featuring the whiny , smarmy voice of eminem -- jet is supposedly a devout buddhist , after all , who is very opposed to violence . all-in-all , this is one big stinking mess of a film . even as bad martial arts films go , this one has little-to-no entertainment value whatsoever at all . it 's so bad that exit wounds stands far above it ! watch unleashed or kiss of the dragon instead , both of which are infinitely superior to this steaming pile of dog crap
