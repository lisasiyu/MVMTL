it is hard to get much lamer than - the stan `` tookie '' williams story this movie is the big lie logic attempting to prove itself again . most despotic criminals use a big lie concept to manipulate those in society with the weakest minds a lame too often used mold from which stan `` tookie '' williams is cut . this dvd is nothing more than a big lie ! that ranks right up there with nazi big lie era triumph of the will . like any monster tookie spent his life hating the nasty reprobate aspects that defined his hearts core while hurting others to cover up the fact he lacked strength to confront and overcome demons who likely at birth began consuming his black heart . this dvd should be brought so you can look directly into the face of a demon and see how big lies told on a grand scale can most effectively prevert truth beyond recognition infecting minds hearts and souls . even if stan tookie '' williams is just responsible for `` helping create '' the crips gang that in itself is enough to earn him the one way trip on the needle express in my book . that he writes a few lame anti-gang kiddie books and played his con-game to perfection on 60 minutes , `` convicing soft headed bleeding heart liberals that he is , redeemed '' is of no consequence whatsoever . tookie was a heartless murderer of whole neighborhoods . tookie by helping create his gang murdered the dreams of countless thousands of innocent children made victims of drive by shootings . tookie helped to utterly destroy thousands of urban inner city poor families usually those most ill prepared for the assult he used to lay waste what little they had . tookie raped minds and whole communities holding each hostage at gun point to his perverted twisted desires and whims and a few good deeds no matter how heartfelt do not de-fang this monster of the first order . tookie williams was nothing more than a domestic terrorist superimposed on a gangsta thug dope dealer 's reality . in the end tookie williams got what he deserved a needle ride to hell 's gate if there is any enternal justice . buy this redemption - the stan `` tookie '' williams story dvd if you want to see the modern day media formula for exploiting weak minds at work . i look at stan tookie william 's and all i see is just another a weak minded pathetic monster who underwent his `` caged creep conversion '' but in truth the gang of thugs he spawned go on their merry murderous way . when i saw this dvd on stan `` tookie '' williams he reminded me of ernst rohm ) ( 1887-1934 ) , german army officer and nazi official who founded the sa ( brown shirts who like the crips were just gangs of common thugs who murdered as much for fun as profit . ) this is a good dvd because jamie foxx captured the heart and soul of what it means to be an unrepentant psychopathic , self absorbed social parasite in redemption - the stan `` tookie '' williams story . if tookie gets a nobel prize i think he should be forced to share it with ernst rohm ) ( 1887-1934 ) , german army officer and nazi official who founded the sa ( brown shirts ) as they were in essentially the same business of neighborhood destruction , child killing , weak mind exploitation and death for fun or profit
