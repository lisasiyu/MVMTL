vulgar and offensive before i begin the review , i should take time to mention that i am a huge baseball fan . i rarely miss a game , follow it as if my life depends on it , and see more baseball games at the ballyard every year than i do movies . i also played when i was younger and have worked on baseball-related projects for my alma mater . i had heard that bull durham was one of the best , if not the best , baseball movies ever made . as a fan of field of dreams and the natural , i decided to go and rent this one . figuring that it was about baseball i thought i could n't go wrong , so i did n't check the ratings on any of the sites as i normally do for a movie . big mistake on my part there . i could n't even make it through a half hour of this movie . there was a little bit of baseball but nothing else worth mentioning . the entire thing was about sex , and i had to look away from the tv for some time . i was hoping it would get better but it never did , and after all the sex and foul language i stopped the movie , never bothering to finish it . i was surprised that so many people gave this vulgar excuse for a baseball film such high ratings . looking at the summaries of the ending of the movie , it looks as if there is some baseball action later on but the female characters , who i did not like at all , seemed to persist . unfortunately this movie is filled with sex , and i feel that it was far too inappropriate for any release . i 'm not some kid writing this , i am a mature conservative christian . this movie should offend anyone who believes in him . do n't believe the hype from some of the sportswriters about this one . go and watch a real baseball game -- always a much safer bet for good clean family entertainment , plus it 's very unpredictable and you never know what the results will be
