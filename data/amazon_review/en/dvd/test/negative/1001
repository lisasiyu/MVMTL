dull graveyard charles band invites you into his dull graveyard ... this movie starts with a little girl playing with a bunch of dolls . she mistakenly bumps into a table and breaks a vase . her father comes downstairs and decides to punish her by forcing her to bury her little buddies in a grave outside . she somehow trips and falls into the grave , killing herself . dad buries the daughter with her beloved toys . flash forward to thirty years later , a new family has moved into the house . the youngest son is a nerdy geek who likes to collect action figures . imagine his joy at discovering a whole gaggle of antique dolls buried in his back yard ! these dolls come to life and start protecting their new owner by killing everyone that ever picked on him . there are no spoilers here , i 'm not giving away anything that is n't on the back of the dvd case . charles band returns to what he knows best , making evil puppet horror movies . but just because this is what he knows best , does n't mean he 's any good at it . this is really just a reboot of puppet master and demonic toys with a new set of evil dolls . the production is shoddy , shot on a cheap dv camera with horrible lighting and a soundtrack that someone did on a casio keyboard from 1982 . not to mention the fact that the puppets are the best actors in the movie . ever since charles band came out of retirement or hiding , the blockbuster shelves have been graced with horrible full moon movies that are a few pegs below what they used to be . even in his prime , charles band was nobody 's genius , but time has definitely taken its toll . titles like decadent evil , doll graveyard and the gingerdead man prove that you ca n't keep a hack director down . band is back , folks .
