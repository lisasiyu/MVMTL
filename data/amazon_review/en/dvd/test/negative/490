another disappointing marvel movie who 's idea was it to put jessica alba as sue storm ? chris evans 's portrayal of johnny storm was somewhat disappointing too , although not as bad as jessica alba 's portrayal of sue storm . why do they cast hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies ? they really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters . this movie was somewhat good , but it did n't feel all that great . so far , this movie is just another of marvel 's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of elektra , the incredible hulk , xmen 3 , daredevil , and the punisher . i was so happy to see marvel characters getting their own movies , but after seeing what hollywood does to them , i would rather see marvel 's chracters go back into hiding . special effects were good in this movie , and so was the story . michael chiklis as the thing was great , and his the thing character makeup was done very well , and he played the character well too , as did ioan gruffud with mr . fantastic . jessica alba and chris evans definitely demoted this movie
