worst dvd transfer i 've ever seen . are you kidding me ? this is nothing more than a vhs to dvd transfer and it looks awful . it 's a complete travesty . 'extreme prejudice ' is one of the most underrated action flicks of the late eighties . a wonderful homage to peckinpah that deserves better treatment than this piece of garbage . oh , and the cover art sucks too
