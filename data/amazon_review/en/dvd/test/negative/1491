great movie ... very disappointing dvd release ... this is one of my favorite comedies . it 's not for everyone , as you must understand martin 's unique style of humor . that having been said , the dvd is awful . the transfer is decent , although could have been cleaned up more . luckily , it 's at least anamorphic widescreen . the sound , while hardly sounding like 5.1 , still sounds decent , as i doubt surround sound was on the mind of film makers in 1979 . seriously , it 's not star wars . extras ? fugetaboudit ! no commentary . no making-of . no interviews . just one delected scene , trailer , and a dumb ukelele lesson . the worst part ! there are scenes missing ! perhaps this version of the film is exactly as it was released in the theaters , but i 'm too young to know . however , every time i 've seen it on television , there were scenes not present in this release ... such as the several different people requesting donations from the rich navin johnson . in this , you only get the mexican priest . where 's the guy who needs new seat covers on his plane ? that scene was classic ! you know , this is the second release of this film on dvd , and they call it an `` anniversary edition . '' if they 're going to give it a name like that , they could at least include the cut of the movie with extra scenes added back in . maybe the commentary and a simple 15-minute making-of is asking too much , but at least give us the material that 's already in the can
