draco would not approve of this . i am not someone who hates sequals . i absolutly hate the first dragonheart it is a masterpiece . great effects , great story , sad ending . it is a five star movie all the way . this is horible . first of all the effects are awful . many dragon films form the 1960s looked better . drake looks like a cartoon . the plot is worse then the effects . it involves finding a dragon egg . where did he come from . the first said draco was the last one . now this movie said he was n't . this ruins the first movie . the acting stinks . i ca n't believe anyone over the age of 5 would like this ... watch the first dragonheart
