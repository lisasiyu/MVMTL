great language features band camp was funny , but not as good as the first two american pie movies . it was , however , on par with the third movie in the series . there were the usual silly , outrageous pranks and there were a few characters from the previous movies , but not the main characters . this movie was fun and worth watching , but probably not really worth watching again except for the the language features . the movie comes dubbed in spanish and french , plus you can have subtitles in several languages while viewing the movie in any language . so , this movie might provide a fun way of developing or brushing up on your foreign language skills
