what is the point of this film ? ... i mean , other than making a profit for the studio ( which , i understand , did not happen yet ) ... whoever wrote the script for this doofus movie ought to be re-trained , and put to work doing street-cleaning , or garbage pick-up , or something that he/she ca n't screw up ... better yet , re-train the actors and actresses involved because obviously they did this turkey for the paycheck alone and gave no thought whatsoever to the audiences that would have to sit through this drivel ... the premise of this film had potential , but someone , or , more probably , some committee decided , hey , we do n't want to make anything that is actually good ... heavens no ... what we want is a made-for-teevee spook story with a made-in hollywood big budget ... where did '' white noise '' go wrong ? almost from the begining ... so apparently some lower level employee of the michael keaton charecter is some sort of nutcase serial killer who just may be in the control of some trio of disembodied demons ... or something ... keaton 's pretty , pregnant second wife goes out for a drive and never returns..did she slip , fall , and get carried away in the river ? ... apparently not ... apparently the afore-mentioned nutcase serial killer tortured and murdered her , maybe at the instigation of the demons ( or maybe just because he is a nutcase serial killer ... who can be sure ? ) ... anyway , one day some over-weight evp practioner comes along and tells the keaton charecter that the dead wife is contacting him '' from beyond '' ... spooky ? no , not really , as the overweight guy seems almost a buffon..later we meet another pretty blonde who believes that chubby-cheeks has made contact with her dead boyfriend..keaton hears a tape that may contain his wife 's static-filled voice , and he 's hooked..later he sees tragic episodes before they happen ( and claim lives ) , and finds out that , maybe his dead wife is directing him to the scenes of local accidents , deaths , and worse ( again , we are never sure what exactly is going on ) ..then the big guy winds up dead , but not before telling the keaton charecter that there '' are a lot of bad people out there '' ( sort of like in real life ) ..keaton fails to prevent the blonde whose boyfriend may have contacted her '' from beyond '' from falling out of a high-rise apartment ( which would have killed you or i but did n't kill her ) , he goes to an uncompleted high-rise where some missing housewife is being tortured by his employee , is maybe attacked by demons and dies ... oh , sure , there is more to this loopy script , but why bother telling it ? i can write a better scarefest than this ... probably so can you..
