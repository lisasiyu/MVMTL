what in the world ... alright , the film has gorgeous landscapes , beautiful costumes and quite talented actors . however , if the director believed that incorporating pornography in the film would make up for its lack of historical accuracy , she was sadly mistaken . first of all , artemisia `` was '' raped by agostino tassi -- although she did not bring up a case against him as soon as it happened -- and she never fell in love with him . agostino tassi , likewise , was never the loving and caring person portrayed in this film but an opportunistic man who believed himself to be superior to all other artists of his time , and the reason he raped artemisia was that a virtuous girl would `` pay '' a lot of money amongst friends , and the one who rid the girl of her virginity would win and ensure that the girl did n't find a suitable husband . yes , artemisia did go to trial , and yes she was tortured , but all the while for her case against agostino tassi . she accused him of rape -- even though her father did not support her -- and won her case after being tortured and ridiculed for being a `` female painter '' . i was extremely disappointed in the film and i 'm sure that art historians will find it as ridiculous and faulty
