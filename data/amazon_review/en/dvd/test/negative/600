garbage for all seasons ! ! this was a mess . this movie gave me the feeling that i was was watching a really bad made for tv film . i was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was . everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles . viggo mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan . all in all , this film was predictable , formulaic and a bore . please save your money for something worthwhile
