pretty , but vacant . immortel ( ad vitam ) ( enki bilal , 2004 ) while i was not overly impressed with bilal 's nikopol trilogy on the page , i figured a film made out of it could be a pretty fun ride , and with bilal himself at the helm , i had high hopes for it . most of them , unfortunately , were dashed in the first few minutes . the one thing everyone agrees on is that the film looks quite nice . and it does -- some of the cgi faces are so realistic they put me in mind of the best scenes in the final fantasy film . and the integration of actual actors and cgi characters is often seamless . the `` sets , '' though , are second-rate bladerunner wannabes . there was a lot of potential in them , and most of it was wasted . the acting , even when delivered by some pretty high-powered acting talent ( charlotte rampling , for example ) , is atrocious . the two main actors , linda hardy ( who , aside from this , has yet to land a major role ) and thomas kretschmann ( soon to be seen in the film adaptation of the celestine prophecy ) are both wooden . rampling injects a touch of vivacity into her role now and then , but it 's not nearly enough . the plot is ... well , i can definitively say there is a plot . and that it is , in fact , connected to the nikopol trilogy in some way . but when you do n't meet the character of nikopol until half an hour into a hundred-minute film , that should tip you off that things are n't staying completely faithful to the book . there are scenes you 'll recognize , if you 've read the nikopol trilogy , but i can tell you from experience : having read it does not make this movie any more lucid . in fact , it may add to the confusion . in short , aside from the visually appealing aspect , i ca n't find a single thing about this movie to recommend to , well , anyone .
