awful , incoherent mess . this movie 's only redeeming quality is the visual effects ... as an artist , i have to admire their efforts . but other than that , the movie is just unwatchably bad . there just is n't a coherent plot . the movie jumps from place to place , throwing in random events that leave you staring in confusion at the screen . every time you think the story has settled down from its bizarre wandering , another case of poor editing shows up to shatter that illusion . add in bad acting , awful `` humor '' , and you 'll be looking at your clock wondering how much more you have to sit through
