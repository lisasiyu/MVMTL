b is for abominable or how about b is for , `` an r rated scooby doo '' ? yes , it 's really that silly . funny thing about abominable is that i was actually entertained . but was it a good movie ? the idea of providing potential viewers/purchasers of this movie with a customer review is to help them decide whether or not the movie is worthy of purchase , right ? or let 's just say that a review here is to determine whether or not you should even rent/view . i gave abominable 2 stars . then why ... after i just said i was entertained by abominable ... would i only give it 2 stars ? well , it 's this dilemma i 've been having with trying to fairly rate movies in order `` to be helpful '' . what i mean is , in the genre : aliens would be 5 stars . therefore , is abominable a 5 star movie comparatively ? no way . the descent would be 4 stars . therefore , is abominable a 4 star movie comparatively ? no way . slither would be 3 stars . therefore , is abominable a 3 star movie comparatively ? no way . i am left with an entertaining movie that does n't compare to the aforementioned . hence , i can ( fairly ) only give abominable 2 stars , right ? look , according to amazon a 2 star rating means , `` i did n't like it '' . but that 's not really true . it was okay . it started good and went quickly into the spiraling vortex of a silly , continuity-issue , b-acted , made-for-tv horror flick . so go for it if you 're compelled to watch a movie about big foot gone wild with the classic deaths of those that break the `` scream '' rules of what you 're not supposed to do in a horror movie ( complete with gratuitous nudity ) in order to stay alive . abominable is not quite as bad as the 2-star `` i did n't like it '' rating that i donned it with . but it sure ai n't no 3-star slither . it 's a 2006 made for tv b-movie . b is for snow job .
