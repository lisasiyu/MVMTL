such a bad movie they made a second ! the first movie was full of hammy and snobbish acting . perhaps it was the point of the first movie to just be rude and awkward because the plot of this movie is that a boy bets his step sister that he can sleep with the new girl on campus . this is not an original plotline , but the added twist is that if the boy sleeps with this new girl , as part of the bet the step sister will give herself to her step-brother . take that for what its worth . there was a good crop of rookie actors in the first movie , but then the second movie is not worth it at all . it was a b movie ... which is why it went straight to video . if your a frustrated teen boy , you will love this movie for its sexual content . otherwise , it is greatly overacted and over dramatic
