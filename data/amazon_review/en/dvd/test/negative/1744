disappointing this is a really disappointing product for a couple major reasons . first , there 's the logistical problems . so much of the footage is poor and so badly-cut together that me and my husband , both punk fanatics , wanted to turn it off out of frustration at how jumpy and un-followable the narrative was . second is the truly unforgivable part and that 's the incomprehensible leaving out of so many pertinent bands and events . i understand if you ca n't cover everyone , of course you ca n't , but they left out more than they included . really disappointing ... i doubt i 'll ever want to watch it again
