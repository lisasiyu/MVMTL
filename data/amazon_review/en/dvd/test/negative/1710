only a slight improvement above kickboxer 4 kickboxer and/or mark dacascos fans may want to look elsewhere . while kickboxer 5 is a bit better than the fourth , that 's about it . there are a few good fight scenes halfway through the movie but then it goes downhill from there . kickboxer 5 starts off with david sloan getting murdered by some crimeboss in south africa . mark 's character declares vengence ( what a surprise ! ) and he goes off to find the crimeboss responsible for david 's death with the help of an escaped convict . the final fight scene with mark dacascos and the crimeboss is just as ridiculous as the final fight scene in kickboxer 4 . as most direct to video films go , this one does n't deliver overall so if you are one who wants to see the kickboxer series than just stick with the first three movies . trust me on this one
