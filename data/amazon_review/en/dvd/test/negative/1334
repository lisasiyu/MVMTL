mindless black revenge drama , boring racist cop john shaft ( again the over rated sam jackson ) thinks that he can break all the rules and beat up innocent people , blow up the streets of new york and shoot anyone he wants to , well , this movie is a bit of something absurd . the direction is terrible , the action sequences are cliched and the `` black brother '' message does n't really make sense because it falls flat by endorsing to kill all `` honkeys '' . i would avoid this mess unless of course you are someone who feels that violence is necessary against innocent civilians ... ..
