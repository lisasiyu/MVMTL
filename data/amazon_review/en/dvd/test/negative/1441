zombie baby is too much i can see the excitement , people get out of a gorefest but this is too much . all taboos have been broken there is nothing left . johnny cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of cash 's songs . he would never have approved of this film . letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste . johnny 's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore
