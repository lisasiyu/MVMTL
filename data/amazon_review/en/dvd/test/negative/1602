why ? what were they trying to do ? i mean c'mon either they were stupid and bought a crappy camera and got really really bad actors , and they try to remake some of the scenes , oh my god . this movie sucks its at the bottom of my movie list . i rather lick the seat of a toilet in a public bathroom than watch this movie again . it is nothing i repeat nothing compared to the awsome american hit classic movie maximum overdrive ***** 5 stars , oh yeah ! !
