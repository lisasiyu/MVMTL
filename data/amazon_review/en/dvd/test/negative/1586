this should have been a story of human triumph ... the film is well crafted , but i do take issue with the racial tones of the storyline . stop making 'race ' an excuse . people get out of life what they put into it . this should have been a story of human triumph instead of some run of the mill sociopolitical statement . there is waay too much of this happening today . my appologies to the production crew , but 1 out of 5 stars is all this movie deserves .
