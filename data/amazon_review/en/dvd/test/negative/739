not enough variation although the video was easy to follow , there was no variation between the segments . the 10 minute segments were basically the same . i was looking for a quick video that i can do in the morning but it seemed that i spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves . if you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you
