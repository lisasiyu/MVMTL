just another heist movie & quot ; heist & quot ; is , well , an heist movie like so many others . this one goes completely by the book and is uninspired at all levels . gene hackman gives a standart , average performance as the burglar who starts having problems with his mates . this is a & quot ; who fools who ? & quot ; picture , it has some required though predictable twists at the end and the character motivations remain unclear . in fact , the characters themselves remain unclear , since they don`t speak all that much and the dialogue is poor . acclaimed director david mamet glues scene after scene with little creativity , so most of them turn to be boring and lifeless . this just seems like a weak episode of some late-night cable b-tv series . dull , unsurprising and shallow , one to avoid
