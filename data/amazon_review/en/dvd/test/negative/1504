adrien paul , the only reason to watch the breed . i rented this movie because i love adrien paul in highlander and well the premise that he is a vampire makes it all the sweeter . unfortunatly he alone could not carry the film . the movie is set in an skewed alternate version of the reality we all know . the version we get is a neo nazi like world in a bleak black and blue hue . the funny thing right off is the human police station is littered with propaganda messages and posters . why the filmakers put that in this movie is beyond me . i guess their trying to convey the surrealism of this world . vampires in this `` reality '' exist and recently exposed themsleves to humans at a risk of being demonized . then when the process is at its critical stage , a serial killer emerges from the shadows and starts picking off young college girls . we find out that the killer is a vampire and has a political agenda . which is to stop the vampires assimilation into humanity . a great premise which is killed at the very begining.the acting at best was a classic b-film . the actors look as though they know that the script sucks but they try to make it seem as if it does n't . adrien paul is very convincing in his role as vampire cop aaron . he is the only bright spot in the film . bai ling is a eccentric female vampire who falls for bookem woodbine 's character . i forget his characters name because he was as wooden as you can be . he does n't fit the whole `` tough cop in a bad situation trying to make the most of it '' kinda guy . the scenes in themselves seem ridiculous . at one point in the film adrien paul 's character is shooting at human cops because they attacked first i guess . he does this spinning in the air thing and you can obviously tell that he 's spinning on wires . the sex scene reminded me of well a soft core porno because the music in that scene sounded just like the chessy music in such a film . minus the nudity . you see them bumping and grinding but it never really goes anywhere . and they like showing a pillar apparently in the `` bedroom '' with ivy and water pouring down it . maybe that is an innuendo . the nudity that is in the film is downright ridiculous and makes the audience feel embarrased to watch it . over all i think it could have been done better and i only watch it to see adrien paul in all his sexy vampire glory . i 'd let him bite me anytime
