failure it 's well known that 'showgirls ' flopped . i remember director paul verhoeven getting an award for having produced something like 'the worst movie of the year ' . it 's not hard to point out its failure : the young & attractive lead elizabeth berkley can not act . as elizabeth is in focus quite a lot , her frequent appearance turns 'showgirls ' into disaster . in hindsight it 's incredible that an experienced director like paul verhoeven hired someone like her . i guess the blatant display of nudity in berkley 's role , as well as in this whole movie , made better actresses look elsewhere . the more so , while 'showgirls ' theme and plot are somewhat meagre . one star for the effort , and another for the nice picturing . any lavish display of female nudity can not cover the failure of 'showgirls ' concept
