i saw this with a holocaust survivor we enjoyed the early parts of the film because of the humor , but my friend , a survivor of auschwitz birkenau and a forced labor camp , was finally outraged by this treatment of the holocaust , as was i . a child in auschwitz would have been gassed to death immediately so there would be no chance to make a game of the camp experience ! my friend would have been gassed to death , because he later found out they gassed all kids under the age of 18 soon after he left for a labor camp . watch divided we fall instead ! or for a very good depiction of life in the camps , watch fateless or the grey zone
