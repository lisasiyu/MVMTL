a big disappontment ! the dvd is too short with music content . the songs are edited and even the lenny white song is excluded from the dvd even though it is listed on the cover . i have been a stanley clarke fan since the rtf days and was waiting patiently for this release but i guess i would need to wait some more to see if there will ever be something release from stanley that is better than this
