they were onto something ... this is definitely one of the strangest superhero movies i 've ever seen . daryl ( damon wayans ) and kevin ( david alan grier ) are two brothers who grew up on watching `` batman '' ... and nothing else is explored with that opening scene . kevin has grown up to be an writer for one crazed editor . daryl , on the other hand , is an inventor who , of course , has dozens of ridiculous gadgets that will somehow pay off ... or will they ? yes , his tools are creative , but they serve no purpose other than comic relief , which i did n't find funny except for daryl 's embarassment . sadly , the two brothers ' grandmother is killed because she works for a city mayor nominee who ticked off a cliched mobster ( jon polito ) . daryl swears revenge by dressing up in a ridiculous costume and using those odd gadgets to fight crime and build a secret hideout ( which i 'm surprised nobody finds since it 's at the end of a train track ) . let me make this clear - there are some hysterical moments in this movie . the bickering between straight-laced kevin and wannabe idealist daryl is side-splitting . in fact , just about every scene with these two is very funny . the problem with this movie is that it has such a dark , dramatic tone in some scenes that just does n't fit . for example , blankman takes a reporter ( robin givens , who 's basically a black version of lois lane - that 's not a racial slur ) to this hideout , but there is some music that reminds me of a despressed version of danny elfman 's score of `` edward scissorhands , '' and some comedic actors trying to be serious about the world and love . that scene is absolutely disastrous . there 's another scene when the mayor is going to publicly open a bank and asks blankman to be present for the dedication . but then polito 's mobster and several thugs chain him up and set off a time-bomb that kills the mayor , and possibly other people . this is not funny ! the movie is not trying to have a dark sense of humor at all , but instead goes for laughs that seem like they belong in `` do n't be a menace in south central ... '' the contrast of tones and themes do n't work . another case in point , blankman fights crime on his first night out and confronts a pimp slapping a woman around , but then blankman 's genius idea is `` slap me around and call me susan ! '' the scene is funny , if improbable ... but seeing a woman slapped around and turned into comedic violence feels wrong to me . maybe i 'm taking this movie too seriously , but when i see some jabs at classic superheroism that make me laugh uncontrollably ( daryl 's inability to face life seriously instead of as a tv show is priceless ) , and then see some drama that is not only misplaced , but also horribly filmed and acted , then the potential hides itself underneath a movie that 's trying to be a superhero comedy `` plus '' an urban drama `` plus '' a hip-hop flick . this movie has a serious case of split-personality with no hope of control . i really want to like this movie , but it strikes so many wrong notes that i ca n't quite recommend it
