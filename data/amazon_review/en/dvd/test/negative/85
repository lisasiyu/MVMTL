it skips chapters i have now received 2 copies of this dvd and if you notice there are 3 episodes or more that do not play correctly . my personal favorite is the episode were jerry is trying to become homecoming queen . it skips a whole chapter ... the weesle & the chicken ... maybe the best comedy i have ever seen . please check your copy and see if this happens , it is not the fault of amazon it is a bad transfer to dvd that needs to be fixed . if you need to see this chapter it will go black screen for a short time after the locker scene , and skip to the next chapter . to see the chapter , go backard 1 chapter . i have had the same problem on all dvd players
