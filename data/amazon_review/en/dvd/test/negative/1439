eric is way to tense on this one well this is going to be hard to say , because i like eric , and i highly say these dvd 's below are some of the best i have for music . eric clapton - sessions for robert johnson ( 2004 ) dvd cream reunion dvd also , this dvd is closed captioned , which is great ! we need more of this ! but that 's about it . eric is so tense in this , you can just read it in him from the get go . i thought well maybe it will work out in the show , as many shows start off less that killer . but this show never got off . sound is not that great either , its `` ok '' on sound , but something is not right , not sure what it is , older tech ? this is going to be hard to say in here but what are you people smoking that write great reviews ? have you ever even been to a concert ? i have been to over 300 in 20 years . that 's not to brag , but geez peeps , this show is not even close to cool . maybe it 's me and my 6th sense , people always tell me i can read people pretty good . well , i tried , and i wanted ! to like it ! but sold it and without even letting anyone see it , that 's how off this dvd is . listened with sennheiser 595 's , the best that i have found , had 555 for a couple years they are nice too , but cant touch 595 's , pay the dif and see , er i mean hear .
