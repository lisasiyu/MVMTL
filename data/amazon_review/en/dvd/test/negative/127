surprisingly slight and insubstantial the new world is the least of terrence malick 's limited filmography to date , and could be best described as a monotone poem . it 's not exactly bad , just mundane and rather forgettable even while you 're watching it , more of a self-indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience . visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired , while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections from his classical music collection , which does n't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out : even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings . another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific colin farrell , a nice enough lad offscreen i 'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just can not carry a picture no matter how many chances he 's given . true to form he trots out his two `important picture ' expressions - the bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he 's not been getting enough roughage in his diet . the fact that he 's outshone by q'orianka kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy , although to be fair he has been worse . indeed , among the male leads christian bale does much , much more with much , much less in the last third of the film , as does a typically underused christopher plummer in the first third . malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of jamestown , but because it happens to people we 've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight . if anything , it just made me think of how much more herzog could have made of it all . moments work , most notably the expulsion of the `naturals ' from their land and the brief latter sequences in england , but on the evidence of the 135-minute version i very much doubt malick 's promised longer cut will solve the problems . i know it 's meant to be a work of art , but i just came away with the feeling that i 'd watched an old and very average universal international 50s western redubbed by first-year philosophy students . the only surprise was that jeff chandler and his bouncing basques did n't crop up .
