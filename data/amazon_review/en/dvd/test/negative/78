loaded deck shoots blanks considering the sensational cast ( eli wallach , terrence hill , bud spencer , kevin mccarthy and brock peters ) , the euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot , ace high is a major disappointment . the plot is uninvolving and incoherent , the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style , the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever . the editing looks like it was performed with a butcher 's knife . after the first ten minutes , i knew i 'd made a mistake buying it . a boring 120 minute piece of junk , ace high is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great italian westerns including corbucci 's the mercenary or parolini 's sabata series . save your fistful of dollars for a better film
