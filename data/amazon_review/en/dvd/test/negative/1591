done me wrong ! i recently purchased this movie after seeing in the past on cinemax . i bought this after seeing it was listed as unrated and directors cut , which i thought was cool it sounded great . now unless the director is a prude this is were i was done wrong . on cinemax they showed a hell of alot more than on this dvd . this had so much heavy editing that i felt so wronged in my purchase . if anyone else feels the same join the club . the movie had some hot scenes , but after watching this version i lost the interest real quick . the movie should have at least 3 to 4 stars for its sex and nudity , but i felt wronged . the only thing i could think of is that someone messed up and put the pg-13 version in my box
