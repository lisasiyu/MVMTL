corny , clunky , a deserved turkey of the early 90s . the rocketeer is the cinematic version of all the faux-deco buildings that have been erected in recent years around los angeles , particularly the miracle mile area . it 's wafer-thin nostalgia masks a chintzy story that ca n't stand on its own two feet . the plotting of the rocketeer is sound enough for adolescent fare . unfortunately , the characters are totally uninspired and the dialogue atrocious . worse still is the execution of the material . every actor is miscast and thoroughly lacking in charisma . bill campbell -- ever hear of him anymore ? he overacts every single scene . timothy dalton ? hammy . jennifer connelly is the only one to come out unscathed . the direction is beyond weak . when the rocketeer appears at the nightclub it is so poorly staged , so cloyingly `` goofy '' that it extinguishes the promise of anything remotely thrilling from happening . add to this foul mixture a horrendous james horner score ... you get the idea . still , some nice set design and an effective animated film-within-a-film make for a couple high points .
