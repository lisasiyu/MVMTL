i like lenny bruce just fine , but ... i always thought of dustin hoffman as tootsie , which i have n't seen , and the movie producer from wag the dog , which i love . or rain man , another fine film . but hey , the guy can give us a nasty edge if the script calls for it . hoffman became lenny bruce . bruce 's material was great at times and awful at others . nowadays , of course , none of it would be shocking . the film shows us bruce 's faults , unedited , presumably in contrast to the great material he could produce because of and/or in spite of his excesses . but still , something is missing . something crucial . i do n't know what . i only know this film could have been so much better .
