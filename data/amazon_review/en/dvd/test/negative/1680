hanging up disconnects while watching this film , i found myself irritated with the whining and bickering that goes on , and wondering how it could have been better . hanging up tells the tale of three sisters : meg ryan is eve , the bulwark of the family , runs her own business ; diane keaton as georgia has her own self titled magazine ; and lisa kudrow is matty , the somewhat vapid soap opera actress . their elderly father ( walter matthau in his last movie role ) is having memory problems , ca n't walk and is admitted to a hospital . he is going to die . ryan is the daughter who is saddled with the responsibility of her father , while the other two are too self-centered to even care . all of this could have made for a compelling `` dramedy '' but director keaton allows over emoting and all that conflict to override the gentler side of losing a parent . and matthau is not all that likeable either . cloris leachman has a brief appearance as his ex-wife and adam arkin is ryan 's globetrotting husband . it 's surprising that the most honest moment in the film comes in a brief sequence between ryan and the mother of a doctor whose car she crashed into in the hospital parking garage . ryan tries gamely to hold the movie together and although she is quite good , she ca n't really salvage the film . keaton and kudrow are both adequate , but no depth is observed . matthau is more like matthau than a true character and it 's sad that his last role is so unlikeable . hanging up tries to tackle sensitive and real issues but it 's so contrived it fails
