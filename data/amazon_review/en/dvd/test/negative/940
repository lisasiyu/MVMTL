throw plausibility out the window in this stinker we went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick , much less anyting with jamie lee curtis . it came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it . whether the movies promised to be good or bad , we went and had fun with them either way . this one we had fun in how bad it was . this was one of those , `` picked on , pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank , only to come back with genius killer skills , somehow attained super strength and the speed of the road runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play . '' in short , there 's nothing to be believed in this stinker . like a `` friday the 13th '' flick , you merely wait for the kills , and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends , and pray for that to come as soon as possible . the movie pulls out the stops , giving us curtis for eye candy and david copperfield to amaze us , perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect . but in general , this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a `` halloween '' type thriller . there 's too much stupidity from the victims , oh , until one genius finally puts 2 and 2 together . there 's too much `` not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison . '' and given her presence , there 's just not enough jamie lee to make this crock worth sitting through . we had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre . it made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse , more predictable , and far too numerous to maintain our interest . this movie got that ball rolling . do n't waste your time . you 'll get more excitement out of watching jamie lee 's finger nails dry for a couple hours
