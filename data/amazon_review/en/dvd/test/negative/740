wholesome , weird , and dull this picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick . a rather pointless attempt to remake brewster 's millions with an altuistic slant . it was n't a `` bad '' movie it simply was n't a `` good '' one . boooooooring ... zzzz..zzzz..zzz
