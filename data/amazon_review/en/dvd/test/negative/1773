blood sport rules ! ! ! ! ! let 's face it , tbs wo n't even show this . we 've all seen blood sport 30 times on tbs , and it 's good . now , i 've never seen this movie , but looking at the cover , it sucks . there 's no action on the cover . van damme made one good movie , and blood sport was it . now daniel bernhardt tries to jump on and ruins everything . it 's like watching the karate kid iii , after ralphie grew up . do n't read the reviews for this . look at the cover and hit yourself . continue hitting yourself until you realize you were about to make a horrible mistake . you 'd be better spending your money on howard the duck
