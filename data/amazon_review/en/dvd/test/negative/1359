really two-and-one-half stars on normal scale , but dir . mark lester screws this one up ! take eugene levy ( puhleez ! ) , his former canadian ( r.i.p . ) sc-tv alum john candy and add 'commando 's ' dir. , harold ramis and ( ! ) james keach ( ! ! ) to the writers and what do you have ? an only moderately funny john candy movie ! there are some great bits in here - but this movie is the greatest waste of space ( make that talent ! ) since greenland ! robert loggia and meg ryan are wasted in stupid stereo- typical roles . and levy with ryan ? ! about as bad as billy ( clipper-fan , his only redeeming quality ! ) crystal with ryan ! or tom hanks ! lester did better here than with 'commando ' , but is that really saying much ! ?
