disappointed short , sweet , and to the point , i was extremely disappointed in this version of the mikado . i guess i should have known it would be a poor production when a new copy is selling for $ 1.62 . i learned a valuable , albiet inexpensive , lesson though . from now on i will read the reviews before making a purchase
