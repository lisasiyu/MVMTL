nose dive to oblivion when david rabe 's play `` hurlyburly '' opened on broadway in august 1984 , it was directed by mike nichols . it ran for 343 performances -- a long broadway run -- and was nominated for the tony award for best play . william hurt was nominated for best actor in his role as eddie . judith ivey who recently appeared in the clint eastwood film `` flags of our fathers '' won the tony as featured actress in a play . the rest of the cast included harvey keitel as phil , cynthia nixon as donna , ron silver as mickey , jerry stiller as artie and sigorney weaver as darlene . it 's easy to see why a producer would want to bring this to the screen . with lead actors sean penn , kevin spacey & anna paquin , there are four oscars to make this an award-winning cast . perhaps there is a great difference from a mike nichols production that would bring out the ironies and balance it with comedy to this film director anthony drazen who won the filmmaker 's trophy @ sundance for `` dramatic zebrahead . '' whatever the reason , the film quickly become tedious and the down-spirals into a valueless void . it is hard to deny that sean penn is one of the most brilliant screen actors working today . he won the best actor award for this picture @ the venice film festival . as eddie , he snorts cocaine like a chain smoker , snarls , cries & puts his hand in his pants . watching the actor bounce between highs and lows must be a qualitatively quite difference performance that william hurt 's on broadway . penn is worth watching . he 's brilliant and makes the film worth a second star . kevin spacey as the manipulative mickey is hardly endearing . yes , compared the other guys he seems relatively together . but his separation from his wife and family are hardly touched upon in the screenplay . it leaves spacey with a mono-level performance that , while interesting , does not move us because he does n't change . chazz palminteri as the gorilla-minded neanderthal phil that ca n't control himself around women is utterly obnoxious . it 's unclear why eddie keeps him around . perhaps to feel that he 's better than someone else , as the dialogue indicates . but we do n't really get that emotional need . thus when phil drives off mulholland , we 're really just glad to be rid of him . i agree that the women are the most likeable . however , we fail to understand why they hang around these guys . robin wright penn 's darlene seems too bright & together to connect with eddie . as the waif donna , anna paquin almost made me forget her rogue character from the x-men movies . she is so vulnerable that i felt sorry for her . as bonnie , meg ryan takes the role that won ivey the tony , but we fail to understand why she is loose . she does n't seem like a girl who 'd have such low standards . the fact that she walks out on eddie seems to confirm this . screenwriter david rabe had worked with penn in two other films , `` state of grace '' & `` casualties of war . '' while penn comes off the best , the overall effect of the story is that these are successful people who live in the hollywood hills , but who have no moral compass and are profoundly unhappy . it was a chore to make myself sit through the entire film . i could only do it late at night after my wife had gone to bed , because she wanted nothing to do with it after the first 10 minutes . so while this project may have been wonderful on broadway , the film version nose-dived into oblivion . taxi !
