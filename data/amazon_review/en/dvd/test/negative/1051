meh ... i 've been there i gave this 2 stars because i think dominique swan is right on - she was the most wonderful lolita ever - and because as a gal who loves her rock n ' rollers i thought this was going to be the greatest movie ever . but , it failed to impress . i was the dominique swan character , running after my favorite rock band because i was hopelessly in love with the lead singer and would stop at nothing for him . i 've had those nights standing out in the rain or arriving at a show that 's canceled because i loved that band so much . and my determination paid off ! *patting myself on the back* but the subplotting lead me to see this as a silly teen movie . the lesbian aspect was tripe , but i realize that were i in her ( dominique 's ) position at her age i would n't understand something like that either . the other characters were shallow , and it was n't all that swift a story line otherwise
