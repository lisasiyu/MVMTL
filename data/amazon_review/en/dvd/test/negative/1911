i could only watch 20 minutes of it . i can not believe that i paid so much for such a horrible movie . i thought i was buying the cream of the crop and i ended up with this . after 20 minutes i could n't stand it anymore . i 've never seen a movie so stilled . it seemed as though the scenery was all plastic . i rated it 1 star , if i could , i would not have given it a rating at all . the movie starring daniel- day lewis was a much better version . actually there is n't any comparision between the two
