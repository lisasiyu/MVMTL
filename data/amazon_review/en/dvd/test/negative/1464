sorry , but no . so , before the other reviewers jump all over me and accuse me of all manner of personal deficiencies , let me state for the record that i am over 40 , remember the cold war very clearly , am not a pc leftist , and am perfectly capable of enjoying wacky farce . that said , this movie just did n't work for me . the premise was good , but the jokes were only occasionally funny - most of them were lazy and feeble and just fell flat . and except for cagney , the actors were too shrill and strident . everyone was straining so hard to get it across that `` hey , folks , this is really funny stuff here , ca n't you see us sweat ? '' comedy needs to appear effortless . this movie is wearisome . okay , let the motive-sniffing and ad hominem remarks begin
