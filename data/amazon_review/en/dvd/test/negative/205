a sleeper ( literally ) this movie was so bad , i fell asleep watching it in the theatre . i normally like buddy films , but this one was just plain bad . the jokes were horrible , the acting was worse . reality tv fits into this movie seamlessly , which is probably another reason why i did n't enjoy it . i think `` reality '' programming is another sign of the steady decline of the entertainment business . to sum it all up , save your money , i 'm sure you can find a better way to spend it
