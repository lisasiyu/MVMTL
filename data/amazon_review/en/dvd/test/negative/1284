perfect my friend and i randomly found this movie at the rental place and were in for a good laugh , so we rented it . we were right when we were looking for a laugh . it was probably the worst acting i 've ever seen . not to mention , completely plotless . the whole idea behind this movie is ridiculous ; from the zen-like janitor to the 'popstar 's greatest fear : taking a math test . please buy or rent this movie . its horrible nature seriously entertains
