cheese . with cornbread . `` all the king 's men '' is a total mess and a spectacular misfire , a movie so poorly crafted by writer-director steven zaillian - who 's directed some decent films - that it 's not even fun to skewer . the acting is so arch and absurd , the story is so rootless and confusing and endless , droning , awful music is so melodramatic , that it mostly earns , mostly , our pity . based on robert penn warren 's novel - itself based on the life of louisiana politician huey p long - the movie uses narrator journalist jack burden ( jude law ) to follow a backwoods orator named willie stark ( sean penn ) from county official to powerful governor . stark is a populist , relying on his `` hick '' voters to give him carte blanche to redistribute government funds to public works projects - roads , schools , hospitals . as `` all the king 's men '' opens , stark is about to be impeached by the state legislature . for what ? it 's never made clear . zaillian treats stark like jay gatsby - nobody 's quite sure of the truth . instead of details , we get allusions and random subplots involving jack 's childhood friends ( kate winslet and mark ruffalo ) and surrogate father ( anthony hopkins ) . all three play a role in stark 's fate , but their characters are ciphers . none of the performances are memorable . as stark , penn has two speeds . he 's either a screamin bleeder , his voice breaking and his face ready to pop , or he 's sleepily drawlin like he just ate a pan of cornbread . stark speaks almost entirely in homilies , even in private moments . penn 's talent , which is turning the emotions of a role inside out , does n't fit the role . he 's bought too far into the myth of the guy .
