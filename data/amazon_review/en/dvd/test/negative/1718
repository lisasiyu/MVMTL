heavily edited broadcast tv version the 1983 thatrical release tells the true but much abridged story of billy mills , the oglala sioux who came from obscurity to win the 10,000 meter race in the 1964 tokyo olympics . the core of the movie focuses on mills 's stint as a student and runner at the university of kansas , facing the overt racism of his teammates and the white community , and his personal conflict with his coach , played by pat hingle , over mills 's racing style . the racing scenes are some of the best on film ( if you overlook the out of place football field at the olympics ) , and `` running brave '' rises above the level of the other sports hero genre and other racing films . i have given this dvd a 1-star rating because it is not the theatrical release , but the version that was re-edited for broadcast tv . ( the movie was released as pg . this version , as noted on the dvd box , is rated g. ) several key scenes have been deleted , watering-down or eliminating much of the conflict . this dvd uses a 4:3 ( tv ) aspect ration , not the theatrical widescreen presentation . quality of the video transfer is very poor .
