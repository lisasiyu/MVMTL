blech ... horrible ! what a disaster ! this movie is a complete waste of time from start to finish . the animation is ugly , horrible , and unrealistic and the three stories are bland and boring . what was disney thinking ? oh , i know ! `` let 's see if we can eek a little more cash out of cinderella . who cares if we destroy a beloved classic ? '' several main characters are completely different from the original movie and it makes no sense . in the first story , the king has turned from a happy-go-lucky doting grandpa-wannabe into a stuffy , sour old curmudgeon . suddenly there 's a rule about no commoners in the palace ? uh ... is n't there a line in the original about `` every eligible maiden in the kingdom ? '' the palace was full of commoners that night . the story picks up as the prince and cinderella return from their honeymoon , so in the space of a few weeks , the king has completely changed . i guess they were n't creative enough to come up with anything that would stay true to the characters . the other two stories are equally nauseating and are not worth my time to review or your time to read . avoid this mess of a movie . the really sad thing is that `` ugly , horrible , unrealistic animation and bland and boring stories '' pretty much describes any disney sequel or direct-to-video slop on the market
