redford/gandolfini can not save terrible script redford is a 3 star general sentenced to 10 years , for what we later learn is sending men to die in a mission contradicting a presidential order . gandolfini is the brutal military prison warden , who orders the death of a soldier/prisoner , inciting redford to lead the men in revolt . the problem is both men are cut from the same cloth , as the script poorly distinguishes them . this complexity is useful , but not when neither character is worth rooting for . the most telling scene is when a reluctant follower asks the ex-general if leading men is just moving pieces on a chessboard to him . redford answers it is , and we infer this is 'the burden of command , ' his book on warfare , i.e . the ends justify the means in battle . it is hard to become a pawn for the great military machine , when the cause is unjust or not worth the price . here , the men can just follow the severe code versus revolt . while gandolfini 's warden goes too far , his justification of needing order is reasonable . he tries to get redford shipped out on mental issues , delusions of taking command . the problem is , redford really does what the warden says shows mental infirmity . as if he cant adjust to not commanding thousands , he invents a battle . the battle seems as much about the general 's need to command troops and teach the warden a lesson as anything else . no real reason was given as to why his personal connections could not have fixed the prison problems , and they were already going that way as redford met with the warden 's superior , who 'put him on notice . ' in addition to poor character development , taking one step back the whole basis and execution of conflict in a prison yard is laughable . last , the ending is so insipid , everyone who sees it will think of 5 ways it could have ended more intelligently . the film instead tries to make a tearjerker when no such ending was needed or justified . a great film of the evil nature of man 's institutions is one flew over the cuckoos nest . a great war film for moral ambiguity is platoon . last castle is a must miss
