melinda + melinda = boring melinda and melinda is a concept film . and a good concept at that . basically , two writers are having dinner with some friends and discussing whether life is comic or tragic . a friend begins to tell a story and each writer gives their perspective on how to make it a tragic or a comic tale . so begins our two movies within the movie . with the director , and such a great cast , you 'd think this film would easily be bound for greatness . on the contrary , you 're bound for boredom . the biggest problem with the movie is the casting of radha mitchell as melinda , the only character that is involved in both stories . her acting is stilted and she stumbles along taking scene after scene down with her . another fault is the fact that none of the other actors are in both stories . melinda and melinda would have been a much more interesting film ( both for the audience and for the actors ) if the entire cast would have been involved in both sides of the story . as it is , the story switches back and forth between the two at a confusing pace , and does n't apologize for moving slowly and drudgingly along . will ferrell offers the only breath of fresh air in this film as a married man who falls in love with melinda and ca n't tell her . overall , this movie is quite slow and although there are moments of clarity and even brilliance , you will find yourself wishing to fast forward til something intersting happens ... and if you do so , you may find you 've missed the whole movie
