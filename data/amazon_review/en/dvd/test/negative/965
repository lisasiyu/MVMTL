a few amusing moments ... could have been much better i agree with some of the other reviewers that the selection of sketches here is not as good as it could have been . gilda radner was a very talented comedy actress but this dvd does not showcase enough of her best work . sure , the dance number with steve martin is a classic , as are a couple of the commercials such as `` hey , you , '' but too many of these sketches show her playing a little girl , lisa loopner or the usually gross roseanne roseannadanna . it focuses too much on her as an individual , not the integral part of the snl ensemble that she was . one of the major mistakes the producers of this and the other snl videos i have seen is that when they take the sketches out of context they are much less funny in isolation than in the flow of a regular show . i was disappointed with this , i did n't chuckle as much as i thought i would and had to skip through many of the sketches because they either rapidly got boring , or gross . i wo n't be getting any more of these snl compilation dvds because they simply do n't know how to produce them so that they are funny . i noticed a similar problem with an snl 25th anniversary compilation . i think perhaps these are written and produced by the same people who write and produce the current snl show -- which is very rarely even amusing and usually just a waste of time
