four dances ? you get three . this dvd claims to teach you four dances : the waltz , foxtrot , social quickstep , and the tango . what they fail to mention however is that the instruction for the foxtrot and the social quickstep are exactly the same . the only difference between the two is the speed of the music playing in the background . the dances are very thoroughly taught , until you get to the tango . the waltz , which is probably the second hardest dance to learn , takes the most time to learn with it taking up probably forty-five minutes of the dvds total play time . the quickstep and foxtrot , both the easiest dance to learn , take up about a half-hour each , and the tango , the hardest to learn , they zoom through in about fifteen minutes , as if they were afraid of running out of time on the dvd . the video is relatively low quality , and after a time , the voices of the instructors tend to get on your nerves . pick this one up if you want to learn the basic steps , but that 's about all you 're going to get , and remember that it 's three dances , not four . once you 've learned the foxtrot , you know the social quickstep
