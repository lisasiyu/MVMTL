what a joke ... this is supposed to be entertainment ? well , wait ... yeah , it is ... comedy ! what a joke to think anyone with half a budweiser soaked brain thinks this guy has an ounce of talent ... people that like this stuff probably are the same people who like tim mcgraw , toby keith and the like ... if you ask them & quot ; who has more talent , the eagles or kenny chesney ? & quot ; their likely answer would be the latter ... what are they putting in that there budweiser lately ? must be some kinda mind numbing stuff to make people think this waste of space- poor excuse for a human being and even sorrier excuse for a musician could even stand in the same room with a legend like the eagles or fleetwood mac ... it 's really sad to see the music industry fall to this low a level ... speaking of fleetwood mac , has anyone heard the awful rendition of & quot ; landslide & quot ; by the dixie chicks ? sounds like someone scratching the chalkboard to me ... check out the original , and judge yourself ... if you know what talent is when you hear it..
