best seen with low expectations a strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of matthieu kassovitz 's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'the crimson rivers , ' one of the best french thrillers in years , but , despite including dying steel towns , artificial lakes , monasteries and even the maginot line among its locations , it 's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel . other notable absences include confident direction , decent plotting , concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise , not to mention almost anybody associated with the original . with only jean reno returning and luc besson providing the very uninspired script , my expectations for this were extremely low but , in all fairness , it was n't as bad as i expected . but then , it was n't very good either - just relentlessly average , predictable and forgettable . none of the class or style of the first one , weak tv-show characterisation ( right down to the terrible 'end on a joke ' cop show clich√© ) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original ( chasing super-strong hooded figures , nazi conspiracies , etc ) to little effect . the writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of raiders of the lost ark without the supernatural effects , but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time . but it 's very easy to see why kassovitz , vincent cassel and composer bruno coulais did n't come back for this one : i 'm willing to bet that if anyone else but bresson wrote it , reno would have skipped it too . a good package of extras are included , but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself
