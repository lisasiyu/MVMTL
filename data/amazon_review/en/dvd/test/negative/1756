the stepford wives lay an egg a few days ago i was delighted to learn the stepford wives would be shown on cable tv , but i soon realized i was watching a turkey . the opening scene is a heavy handed parody of the jerry springer show , and from that point it 's downhill all the way . the plot is weak , the characters inconsistent , and the story incoherent . the production values of casting , costuming and set design are certainly high . but that just makes this movie a pointless , glossy mess
