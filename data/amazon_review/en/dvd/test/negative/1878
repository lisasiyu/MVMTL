ugh i 've seen many films from all over the world including bollywood but `` devdas '' is in a class by itself as the most boring pretentious over -produced badly acted by any standards , so that even as self parody its ghastly - without subtlety or the rapturous extravagance one can enjoy in bollywood films . its two hours too long and the leads have the emptiest faces likely to be seen on the screen
