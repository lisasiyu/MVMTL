style over substance this dvd is the perfect example of misjudged style over substance . the concert is well shot in high definition , the direction is slick and the performance is very professional , but the overall experience leaves me absolutely cold . compare this to something like the wonderful deep purple at the california jam dvd , which has grainy video and sound from an original mono recording , and you will see that with all the fantastic technical advances in the world , style can never overcome substance . and ultimately , this particular whitesnake incarnation seems to offer very little in the way of substance . the band members themselves are indisputably technically gifted musicians - but you just ca n't help feel that all they effectively are is a band of hired-hands who learned their craft from watching mtv in the early 80 's . this is no doubt unfair and i am sure they are very nice chaps , but in this setting they just come across as extras supporting coverdale , in the same way as miss kitaen and the jag did in 1987 . as for david coverdale , this is painful ... no ... excruciating to watch . i have long been of the opinion that this man possesses the greatest voice in the whole of popular music - never mind just rock . when singing in the right register , david coverdale has the most wonderfully rich , soulful and charismatic voice to ever grace a rock , blues or soul song . and to be fair to coverdale , it 's not as if he has lost that beautiful rich timbre , it can still be evidenced on his last solon album , into the light , and indeed sounds as good as ever in the setting of some of the mellower songs . the problem coverdale has is that he can not sing heavy rock any more ... .at least not in the high pitched manner he so often attempts on this dvd . he sounds absolutely dreadful i am sorry to say . it 's very sad in a way that is similar to witnessing the sorry sight of someone who has lost a limb . in coverdale 's case , it is the voice that has been amputated , and it 's just awful to witness his donald duck like efforts at out screeching robert plant . unfortunately this seems to be the direction david feels he has to go in in order to maximize his earning potential . his moves back towards integrity , evidenced on restless heart and into the light , were not commercially successful and now he seems to believe that the hair metal brand of whitesnake , born in the late `80 's , is the way to go . judging by the delirious fans on this dvd , he may be right - at least from a financial perspective . he sounds dreadful , and surrounds himself with a cloned band of metal heroes , but at least he 's satisfying the dwindling band of supporters who once made his 1987 album a multimillion seller the world over . integrity seems to be a bloody luxury coverdale can no longer afford .
