lemmings , i think not ! why is it that studios think they know what we like , and even if we do n't like , they know best and we should follow as `` lemmings '' right over the cliff 's edge . this is a classic movie and deserves to be released in it 's original movie-release ratio , in other words , widescreen . i can deal with `` colorization '' by turning off the color ( if i so desire ) , but with pan & scan treatment of a movie , the only other alternative is to not buy the p & s version . i choose the latter . i still have a laser-disc copied to vhs version that is in it 's original aspect ratio , and i will just have to dig this out of the closet . i have a brand new ( bought 3yrs ago ) vhs player still in the box , just for this purpose . wake up hollywood , do n't be a bunch of schmucks , make p & s disappear forever ! ! ! cg13
