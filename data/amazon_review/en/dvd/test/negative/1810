absolute junk ! do n't waste your money . get the following movies ... le mans : about as real as racing can get . just wait until the end of the first lap and you hear the roar of the porsche engine . it gives me chills just thinking of it . grand prix : great cinematography ! the melodramatic story can be a bit much , but the movie in widescreen is spectacular . days of thunder : just plain fun . not that accurate , but a fun movie ... and it 's a bruckheimer ! do n't even bother with driven unless you can borrow it from a friend . do n't pay to watch this piece of unrealistic , hollywood shlock
