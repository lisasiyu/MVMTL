what horrific garbage ! while i was watching this movie i thought to myself , `` am i going to die ? have i gone to horrible movie hell ? '' you see i was trapped in a theater . it 's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you ca n't leave cause b actors are pretending they can act just because they 're fat . the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it 's grossly bright outside and it 's a sunday afternoon and you 're in a car and you 've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape . in conclusion , this movie turns me into melting snow . but i suppose there are worse movies -- ( see my review on gummo )
