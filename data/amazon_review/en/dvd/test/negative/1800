beware the warner brothers rip-off cabaret is one of the great movie musicals of all time . unfortunately this dvd version , released in 2003 is misrepresented as a widescreen format enhanced for widescreen televisions . it is not . the widescreen picture is `` matted '' and fills only a portion of the screen on newer hd sets . since there is no other version available , if you love the movie this is the only way to own it . shame on warner brothers for not releasing a classic like this with a pristine print that does the film justice
