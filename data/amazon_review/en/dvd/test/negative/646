so bad it scared me out of eating i watched troll 2 on showtime beyond ( showtime 's horror/sci-fi movie channel ) and like the movie itself is so bad it 's laughable ! i mean the part where joshua screams out `` your a genius big sister '' nearly made me fall out of my chair laughing the movie takes place in a small town where everyone is a vegan and like the religous people there have a phobia towards those who eat meat and they are `` unpure '' if they eat it which ironically saves johusa in the movie by eating a double decker sandwich with meat the goblins in this movie are creepy esspeically the one with the bolding eyes eek ! anyway thoughout the flim joshua is looking at pictures of creepy looking trolls which is ironic considering it 's golibins anyway in the movie the only way for the golibins to eat is for someone to eat something so they could eat them ! i 'm not a child but that still is a scary thought ! after watching this movie i did n't look at green and red the same way again nor could i eat much only watch this movie if you are looking for a laugh
