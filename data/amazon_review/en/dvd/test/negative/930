total trash ! do n't even think about wasting your money ! ! the 1st `` movie '' : fist of fear , touch of death is so bad i did n't even watch the next 2 . the uninitiated will possibly not know that the footage that purports to be about bruce 's life , family and ancestry is all rubbish and was actually taken from 2 different movies : the ancestors `` cuts '' in color are from a colossally poor period piece that would be funny if it did n't seem to be taking itself seriously . while the black and white parents-and-family `` cuts '' actually are truly a young bruce in a hong kong film that he made before returning to the u.s. to live . however the scenario is totally misrepresented . all of the other participants are actors as well and not correctly identified . nor is the dubbed dialog related to what is really being spoken ( in cantonese ) by the actors . yet a third source is tapped for the `` supposed interviews '' which are not with the speaker at all , but with someone else regarding the work bruce did on the `` longstreet '' tv show in '71 and once again the voice-over not only is not really bruce and is again , not accurate ( and he was speaking english during those interviews ) . one would be better served to buy the `` legend '' dvd from the -bruce lee master collection- or the more recent `` bruce lee : the warrior 's journey '' to see and hear in bruce 's own words and voice what the non- '' what 's up tiger-lily '' version is of the early hong kong ( black and white ) and what the `` longstreet '' interviews have to reveal about him . if this is meant to be a spoof and they just forgot to mention that anywhere , then shame on them . i do n't find it even remotely humorous , not to consider the generations of people who might not know any better since his untimely death 32 years ago .
