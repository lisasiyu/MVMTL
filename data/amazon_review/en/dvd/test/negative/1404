shallow characters , bizarre story that 's basically my two cents . shallow characters , bizarre story . i am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films , but i do like a good story and heard this was one . it was not . all of the characters were inverted - ada and her daughter were utterly irritating , george was disgusting from start to finish , and sam neill 's character ( supposedly the heartless jerk ) was actually the easiest to sympathize with . how frustrating ! on a positive note , michael nyman 's score is unbelievable . i love it
