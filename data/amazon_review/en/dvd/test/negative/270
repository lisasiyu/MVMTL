waste of talent , time , and money i had the unfortunate experience of spending money at blockbuster and renting this dud . with such big name stars , i expected at least a mildly entertaining movie . what i got was one hour of lifeless , drab , big-budget flick . i could n't bear to watch another minute , thus `` tequila sunrise '' became the first rental i stopped watching since that fateful day i rented `` last action hero '' . the actors seem to be stumbling through their scenes , lending not one iota of believability to their characters . i 'm sure michelle pfeiffer , mel gibson , and kurt russell all look at this horrendous piece of garbage as the down point of their careers . i hope the actors had fun making this production ; i sure as heck did n't have any fun watching it
