`` who would want to kill the sweetest ****** woman in the world ? '' i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard ( of sports night fame ) was scowling hard , trying to be a tough detroit cop . not believable for a nanosecond . and then it got worse when marky mark said , `` why do n't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee ? '' the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm . almost every scene in this thing is a howler . and watching it , i remembered i had n't forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was 2 fast 2 furious . still , tyrese is better than garrett hedlund , who looks like he 's a refugee from the outsiders . but the movie 's not a total wash ; after all , it 's got a great soundtrack
