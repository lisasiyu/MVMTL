this is an excuciatingly dull , bad movie as a lover of film noir and proud owner of most that are on dvd or vhs , i can say without hesitation that this is one of the very worst ever . the only reason i gave it two stars , instead of one , was because of the fine performers who were saddled with this inane script . joe ferrer 's hypnosis of gene tierney to allow her to sleep is nothing compared to the yawns brought about by the agonizingly slow pace , lack of action , and interminable pauses between lines . at one point , gene tierney swears that she has n't been lying , and you find yourself wanting to respond : `` of course , you have n't . you have n't said anything of import . '' the storyline makes absolutely no sense . jose ferrer has set up the perfect crime so what does he do ? he returns to the scene for no apparent reason other than to be captured . he hypnotizes gene tierney to steal incriminating evidence and then has her place the items where they will inexorably be discovered . a complete waste of wonderful performers . cross this one off the list , and donate the $ 9.99 to your favorite charity . or pourchase `` the dark corner , '' a truly memorable fox noir with an outstanding performance by a breathtakingly gorgeous lucille ball
