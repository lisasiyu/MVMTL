yawn . i saw this film years ago on a crappy videotape , so before writing my review i decided to give the dvd a chance and you know what ? the picture quality on the dvd is n't much better ( if any ) than the videotape and the story still sucks . yea , vanity gets naked but it 's done in such an unsexy way that it 's well unsexy . she looked sexier with clothes on in the last dragon . the story if you can call it that is about vanity pining for her ex-boyfriend , one night she falls asleep and has an 80-minute dream about them living on a tropical island together . soon she finds a freaky looking gorilla and starts a relationship with him . the boyfriend is jealous and a war breaks out between the two , the gorilla and the man that is , with each kidnapping the girl away from the other and raping her .
