very disappointed ! ! ! ! ! although the description says `` animated '' , do n't believe it ! ! ! the only animation for the george clip is someone moving pictures of the character around ! ! ! my granddaughter ( 4 ) , kept asking when they were going to do something ! the other parts -- yes curious george has only one episode even though the title says other wise -- were very disturbing to my granddaughter . all in all , money i should n't have spent ! ! ! sandy ; ^
