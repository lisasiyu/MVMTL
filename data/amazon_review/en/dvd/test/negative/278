do all films with `` demon '' in the title stink ? i am a huge argento fan , but come on folks ... this movie just stinks . there 's more corn in this flick than the state of kansas . the single entertainment value this film holds is that it provides a medium for a group of drunken men or women to polk fun at something . there are maybe one or two admirable scenes in which argento 's uncanny editing and camera work shine . otherwise its a feast for the idiots ; green blood , bad make-up and all . definately not one to purchase for the collection
