one for the garbage can ... if you are a blackmore fan stay away from this piece of crap because during the guitar solos all you will see is gillan shaking his butt or `` playing '' the congas and everybody else except , of course , the guitar work . i could n't bear it anymore in the middle of child in time and will certainly not check the rest of this mess . on another level , i am just appaled by the extremely poor musicianship of jon lord ! this guy just stinks so bad that even i could take him on the hammond ; i 'm a guitarist by trade . heck , even blackmore is very ordinary from what i 've se ... heard . ca n't say anything about glover because you ca n't hear what he 's playing . so the only high points of this video , as far as i could stand it , is ian paice 's performance which is excellent as usual and gillan 's incredible voice . a very sad thing because dp was my favorite band and one of the major reasons i took up the guitar in '69 . i can certainly live with the bad sound and picture considering the time that the show took place but absolutely not the crappy playing . this one is no keeper and i simply threw it away , but if you really want to see dp at it 's best go for the concerto for group and orchestra dvd , with the royal symphony orchestra , but there again you wo n't see much of blackmore 's work but the musicianship is way better
