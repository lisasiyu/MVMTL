weak content dooms guitar demon i consider buckethead a unique artist with an original vision . the manifestation of that vision on his 13th anniversary dvd , while intriguing and amusing , is for only his most devoted , hard-core fans . i 've liked some of his stuff on youtube , and saw the dvd by chance passing through a cd/dvd store in a mall and took a chance . bad decision . i can go along with the `` cheapo depot '' look and vibe , but when it comes down to delivering content , this is a bloated , nearly unwatchable video . the content is presented in two disks , but it should have been one . the live concert material on disk 2 looks as if shot on consumer grade video cameras , featuring bucket playing along to pre-recorded tracks , doing the robot , and a display of his num-chucks skills . the music , speed-rock with doses of country chicken pickin and classical flavors , sounds largely the same from song to song . frankly , i was bored . the is an experiment gone wrong . his over-the-top dr. phibes meets yngvie meets the dark side of disney is realized as an unfocused mess on this package . the result it had on me is that i am unlikely to buy another dvd or song from him without checking into reviews first , so buyer beware . memo to buckethead : find someone to focus your vision and move on to the next phase of your career
