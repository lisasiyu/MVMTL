**stories & more stories from the acoustic highway** first off let me start off by saying that i am a very big fan of edwin mccain , his band , and his music . i bought this dvd thinking that there would be a good bit of live footage with him playing , but was only left with my pocket 's empty , and my hopes shattered . edwin mccains personality is portrayed here , as all other reviewers have said , but that really is all that this dvd does well . with only about 15 minutes of live music i , as a viewer was left asking myself why edwin and atc records decided to put this disc out . the only notable music on this dvd is `` i 'll be '' . this is very easily edwin 's lowest quality item put out , lacking the passion , and originiality that so many of us know him by . a noteworthy story , if not the only one is the story of how he wrote i 'll be , and the only reason that it is noteworthy , is not because it is a great story , but rather i 'll be is a great track . so if you have money to spare , and time to waste then you can buy this dvd , but unless edwin releases a new dvd i suggest , that you stick to his cd 's
