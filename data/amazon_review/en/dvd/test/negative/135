disappointng i was really excited when i saw this dvd and really deflated when i actually attempted to complete it ! the instructor gives relatively little if any instruction on how to successfully complete moves ; and she switches from combo to combo , move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up . i have also never sweated so much in my life , mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration ! i am in relatively good shape ; i walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine . in only broke my spirits ! unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer , stay away ! one of the worst workouts i have ever seen
