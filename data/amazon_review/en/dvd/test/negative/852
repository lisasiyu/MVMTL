two hours of misery among losers for me , my low rating of this film might be , at least in part , the result of having wrong expectations about it . i had heard this film described as 'charming ' and 'funny , ' and was expected a comedy , albeit a somewhat black one . but despite the good acting , this film left a sour taste in my mouth . it is a dismal and agonizingly dreary film about people you never come to care about . i am an avid foreign language film buff , but i could not see the merit in this crude , hate-ridden and depressing story .
