a sad mess filled with missed opportunities & lots of potential i give this hack job the extra star for the fact that it had some very creepy visuals a handful of jumpy scares & a good idea for a story . how sad is it though when that kind of potential ca n't crutch the horrible outcome , wich resides in plot-hole central usa , home of the university of bad acting & laughable endings ( ubale ) . oh man ! horror fans ! `` boo '' could have been an excellent new low-budget horror flick if it had a tighter script with a much better ending & included some half decent actors who actually had a grip on there character 's . all & all what we are left with is an all over the place mess with some good visuals & scares . so many missed opportunities & so much potential lost . what a sad waste !
