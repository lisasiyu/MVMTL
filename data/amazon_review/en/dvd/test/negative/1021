off the formula but still disappointing the rebel-with-a-heart-of-gold-who-learns-the-meaning-of-love scenario is put aside for a kind of soft spoof of spy pictures , which were very popular in the movies and on tv at that time . the & quot ; european & quot ; setting got elvis off the beach and away from the resorts but the script and direction were basic , to say the least , and the music was uninspired and badly mixed on record . the movie does have one of presley 's best set of opening productiom numbers : & quot ; long legged girl.. & quot ; and others are rousing tunes delivered with that presley panache often missing from his late-'60s efforts . but about 20 minutes into the picture even the most ardent fan reaches for a magazine . an interesting sidelight is that his co-star was a true & quot ; discovery & quot ; - an english teenager making her screen debut with elvis presley ! she handles the light-hearted assignment very well indeed - even the & quot ; old macdonald & quot ; sequence which usually is reprised on documentaries as a typically ludicrous excuse for a soundtrack album cut
