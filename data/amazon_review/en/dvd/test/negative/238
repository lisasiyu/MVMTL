worst movie i 've ever seen ( exept `` i am the cheeze '' ) i was in the army when this came out , working on helicopters . i saw the movie at travis afb in california ... .well , as much as i saw . i did walk out of the theatre . even yelling quips at all of the cheezy lines ( and there are plenty ) was n't entertainment enough to keep me from screaming at my shoes . i left fuming and spent the next hour waiting in a cold m1008 for the rest of my buddies to get done watching it . i 'm sickened watching nicholas cage to this very day
