inept movie still entertaining as a curiosity first , i 'd like to correct one of the other reviewers , who said that snitch 'd is about a `` latino cop '' who goes undercover as a high school student . actually , the cop ( played by writer/director james cahill ) looks asian but is supposed to be white . he 's certainly not supposed to be latino . we know this because one of the students calls him a spanish name , and cahill 's character has to ask a fellow student what he was called . `` white boy , '' she replies . also , i do n't think the movie is set in east l.a . the credits say it was shot in santa ana , a heavily latino city in the middle of orange county , which is just south of los angeles county . yes , the movie is inept and unrealistic . many of the actors playing these high school students look well into their twenties . the guns look like toys . sound like it too . when they 're dropped or tossed aside , you can hear the hollow plastic clatter on the floor . yet this movie is entertaining , in a weirdly `` what were they thinking , '' endearing sort of way . star-writer-director cahill smirks his way through much of the film , like he 's trying to play a suave james bond type . you look at him and think , this inept , non-charismatic asian-playing-a-white-guy actually imagines he 's the next rambo/tough guy/action hero . especially funny is his pursed lips and staring eyes when he sneaks around the house with his gun in `` action hero '' fashion . cahill is morbidly funny ! and yes , his `` martial arts '' is as inept as the film 's toy guns . he grabs a guy 's head and repeatedly `` slams '' it against a desk in what 's supposed to be a quick `` jack-hammer '' fashion ... only it 's slow , and the victim 's head clearly is n't making contact with the table . the victim seems to just go along with having his head banged against the desk , because director cahill told him to . also funny is when cahill uses martial arts to defeat some eight gun-totting ganstas , partly with the aid of ping-pong paddles . one `` actress , '' when she 's acting `` sad '' and telling cahill about her recently deceased friend , seems to be actually smiling . this film is probably being seen only because its female lead , eva longoria , has become famous on desperate housewives , although she is n't much better in this film than the rest of the cast . some , but not much . then again , it must have been hard for the twentysomething longoria to play a high school student swept off her feet by cahill , or mouth his script 's cliche-ridden relationship dialogue . their `` flirting '' in the library is another very funny moment ! they 're supposed to be teenagers , yet their relationship dialogue sounds written for adults , who in turn got their lines from bad romantic comedies . i said this film is endearing . i have a soft spot for amateurs who buy a camcorder and think they can make a hollywood style feature . although i think this was shot on super-8 or 16mm film . that 's because you can hear a camera whirring in some of the shots . and there 's a soft , shot-on-film-then-blown-up look . so although this film is inept enough to merit only one star , i 'm giving it another one for unintentional humor , longoria eye candy , and the effort of getting it finished
