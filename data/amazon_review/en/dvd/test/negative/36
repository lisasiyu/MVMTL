miserable acting , horrible script , inane directing . what a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time , the re-animator . continuing in his deluded quest to claim the re-animator series for his own , and to convince us that he can direct , producer brian yuzna has managed the opposite . beyond re-animator merely confirms what was evident about the yuzna-directed bride of re-animator , that yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story . as with dagon , yuzna seems to have secured financing from spanish sources for this film . unfortunately , the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly spanish cast . this is a story set in massachusetts , for crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison , the reporter coming to cover the story , the guards , and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have spanish accents ? it would n't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act , but they ca n't . simon andreu as warden brando and elsa pataky as love interest laura olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast , but their acting is so bad , and their adr-afflicted lines so glaringly off , that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths . yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes ( witness the gratuitous `` nurse nipple '' scene in this film , or fabiana udenio and kathleen kinmont in bride of re-animator ) , and pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests i can remember . but even pataky and andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery , seething mass of bad acting that is leading man jason barry . based on yuzna 's shoddy history with actors , one might be tempted to blame it on the director , but the fact is that in this film , jason barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment , basic elementary acting . his every internal and external beat rings false , his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading , and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre . most high-school students do better than this . jeffrey combs as herbert west , seasoned pro that he is , gamely plays along , but the script puts west 's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing pataky-andreu axis that combs is unable to save this film . on a strictly technical level , the cinematography looks good , the score is all right ( though often too serious-minded for its own good ) , and the film does n't look low-budget . but when the `` story '' is such a mess and the actors so inept , no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film . yuzna really should stick with producing , because on the stuart gordon-directed dagon , at least there were some good moments . but beyond re-animator is beyond salvaging , possibly the worst film sequel i 've ever seen , and way up there in the list of worst films i 've ever subjected myself to
