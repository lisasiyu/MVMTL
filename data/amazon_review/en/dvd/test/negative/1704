dear walt disney ! do you think we 're fools ? ? ? first of all : i love this movie ! ! ! i give it five stars and more ! but what is your problem with selling a perfect dvd to make your buyers happy ? i saw the movie years ago in germany in the original format and language . the beautiful song : `` when love is gone '' was in that movie and the whole film was obviously in widescreen format ! so ... what is your problem to release the dvd with these features . do you want to make even more money , by saying in a couple of years : `` sorry , we made a mistake . but here 's a new dvd with all of the features for only xx.xx $ ? i 'd recommend to all of the fans : `` do n't buy this dvd ! ! ! '' do n't play into the hands of these big corporations ! !
