legends of the dull more predictable than an old tv land episode of bonanza and much less entertaining , this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons , one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system , one an idealist , and the middle son , tristan , played by brad pitt , a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature 's anger . at least that 's what i think he was doing . the fact is i never was a fan of this movie , not back in the 1990 's when my best friend loved it ( and predicted julia ormond would be a superstar -- sorry , gina , if you ever read this , i just could n't resist working that in there , ha-ha ) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing . i do n't think there 's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone . it 's not spectacular in its setting , it 's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story , and i found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring . to each his own , i know some love this movie , but from where i sit , this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff
