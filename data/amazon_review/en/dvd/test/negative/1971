should have been left in the sahara well , this wo n't take very long . warning ! spoiler here ! leading characters find themselves in a deadly , hopeless situation . characters find some ludicrously unbelievable way out of said deadly , hopeless situation . one character makes a stupid joke , gives the others the high five and then magic carpet ride starts playing . repeat 10 times , and there you have sahara . wacky fun ... if you play little league and had less than 13 candles on your last birthday cake . really , i usually put a lot of time in my reviews , but this one does n't even deserve that . dumbest movie i 've seen in quite some time .
