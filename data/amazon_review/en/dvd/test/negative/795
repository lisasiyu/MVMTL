fair to middling scott western ten wanted men , as many of randolph scott 's other fifties westerns , suffers in comparison to the budd boetticher-directed westerns featuring scott . once again , as with some of the non-boetticher scott films , this movie has a great cast , interesting plot features , and lots of potential , but the payoff is not as great as it should be . scott plays a rancher who takes in a young mexican woman who is being relentlessly pursued by richard boone , who is a rancher coveting scott 's vast land holdings . scott 's generosity toward the woman gives boone the perfect excuse to start trouble , and he hires a gang of thugs , including leo gordon and lee van cleef , to terrorize and try to kill scott , scott 's brother , and scott 's nephew . boone , who is one of the alltime great western actors , seems out of place as a desperate cad who has to hire other men to do his dirty work . also , this film contains many elements of scott 's other movies , and rather than seeming fond and comfortable , they seem tired and warmed over . scott is scott , and that says a lot . he was often criticized for his perceived lack of acting ability , but there was a humanity and honesty about his characters that drew audiences to him then , and still works today , making him one of the most appealing american actors . but ten wanted men would have been better served by boetticher , raoul walsh , or another capable western director
