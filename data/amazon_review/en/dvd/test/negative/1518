with friends like this ... cruise plays brian flanagan , i guess because people think he does a decent irish accent . nevertheless while under the drink mixing tutelage of `` obi-wan '' coughlin ( brown ) he gets involved with coral ( gina gershon ) later telling coughlin of their bedroom exploits . to ensure that flanagan sees the light , coughlin sleeps with coral to try to show flanagan she was no good for him . why coral would sleep with coughlin just because flanagan said they were making nikki-nikki is a mystery ( she 's seen sleeping over at the apartment and all cuddily with tom 's character for god 's sake ) . anyway , what a pal , nice to see coughlin really cares . later , actually just a brief dissolve to ocean shores & islands , despite this friendship-ending dastardly deed flanagan befriend 's coughlin while working in jamaica . now that ( brown ) has found `` true '' happiness ( lynch ) , you 'd think he 'd want the same for ( tom ) , right ? wrong . despite flanagan 's seriously developing affinity for jordan ( shue ) , he dares ( tom ) to bed the mature , rich and connected bonnie ( lisa banes ) . of course , this destroys cruise & shue 's chance for romance , despite his explanation that it 's okay because `` when a guy lays down a dare , you just got to . '' what kind of logic is that ? still later trying to make up with her , he claims he got spooked by jordan , so which one is it ? finally , how nice for hollywood to wrap everything up with death , attempted seduction , pregnancy , attempted bribery , and flanagan striking out on his own in one of the riskiest businesses around a `` theme '' bar . although , cute at times , one has to wonder the next time someone dares tom 's character
