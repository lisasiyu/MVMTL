based on conspiracy theories rather than historical evidence in a very convoluted plot , harvard professor robert langdon ( tom hanks ) and cryptologist sophie neveu ( audrey tautou ) are chased through the streets of paris and london by the french police and a crazed religious fanatic named silas . it 's your typical hollywood action-thriller in most respects . yes , it 's silly and unrealistic . but if that 's all there were to it i might go along with the `` it 's only a movie '' argument . unfortunately , this movie is also full of ideas , ridiculous ideas that run counter to the historical facts . as an atheist , i certainly have no problem that the movie brings up some of the darker moments in christian history . for example , the inquisition , the witch burnings and the crusades are all mentioned . yet these actual historical events are only brushed over . instead the movie focuses on making up some bizarre conspiracy theory that the catholic church is involved in a grand cover-up to prevent the public from knowing the truth about christianity . for example , it states that not only were jesus and mary magdalene married and had children but that their bloodline has continued to the present day . they also portray a secret catholic society that is involved in murder plots , strange sexual rituals and all manner of evil activities . it 's completely fair to challenge the church on its grave errors . for example , the shameful inquisition involved the murder and tortue of many innocent people . i also disagree with the vatican 's present opposition to legal abortion and birth control . however , the sort of ridiculous conspiracy theory that this movie suggests is the worst sort of anti-catholic bigotry . it 's also dangerous to society as a whole as demonstrated by how similar lies and falsehoods have been historically used against jews to justify brutal acts of anti-semitism , including the holocaust . no , i do n't think it 's likely that the `` da vinci code '' will lead to the mass execution of catholics . but any time a particular group is scapegoated it 's a potential source of trouble . basically , `` the da vinci code '' is a bunch of mumbo jumbo , distorted information and flat out lies that are not supported by the evidence . but , unfortunately , as p.t . barnum said , `` there 's a sucker born every minute , '' and some people are going to believe this nonsense . history is a complex subject and i have no respect for people , whether they be the book 's writer , dan brown , or the film 's director , ron howard , who play fast and loose with the truth in order to make a buck . this is garbage . do n't waste your time
