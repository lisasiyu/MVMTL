balkan bullcrap let 's be up straight and honest . there is nothing really to recommend or like about this movie . shot on a shoestring budget way back in 1994 , balkan runner has a stiff and pondering script full of holes ( like how did the hunky hero get unhandcuffed from the dominatrix 's claws ? ) , a talentless cast , and a score reminiscent of a 70s cartoon series . daisy white is certainly lovely as is isabel russinova , but their emotional range is that of a rutabaga . paced incredibly slow and with no exciting sequences to brag about , balkan runner is one of those movies you 've never heard about , and rightly so ! !
