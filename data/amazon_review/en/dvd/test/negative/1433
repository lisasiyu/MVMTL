wack christmas ok , first things first , i never seen the original , so i went into this flick with a clear , open mind . bad move . booooringggg as the day is long , about as scary as an episode of home improvement , suspenseful as an applebee 's commercial . maybe the ending was good , seeing as i only made it through about 57 minutes before i had to take it out of my dvd player and sent it spinning frisbee-like across the room . if this was your idea of scary , `` dirty dancing '' must have really freaked you out . ho ho ho
