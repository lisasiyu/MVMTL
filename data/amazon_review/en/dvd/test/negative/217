this is the review i wish i 'd read before buying i looked at the name ( groovaloos ) and i looked at the cover -- and my gut told me not to get this dvd . i went against my gut and believed the reviews ; i wish i 'd listened to my gut . for those of you who think it looks and sounds a little hokey , you 're right on the money . they can all dance , but compared to what i expected , they seemed mediocre . here 's the lowdown : ( 1 ) the sound sucks - they 're in a city park and you can hear the instructions fine , but the music is n't loud enough to really `` feel '' something that makes you want to move , ( 2 ) they just seem like a group of people who do n't naturally have a rhythm , but they 've learned some moves ; it 's so not inspiring , ( 3 ) it 's not edgy enough , and ( 4 ) it looks good if you 've got a group doing it , but when someone 's doing it alone , it 's just okay . overall , this dvd was okay , but not great . get it only if you 're truly desperate
