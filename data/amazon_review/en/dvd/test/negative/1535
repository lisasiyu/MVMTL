did i ever tell you about the time i invented snowboarding ? out cold tries hard to capture the tween audiences without fully using the infamous `` raunch '' button to be successful . it tries hard to give the audience a graceful combination of physical humor , sexual slap-stick , classic hollywood references , and x-treme sport clips , but in the end it face plants hard into the cinematic pavement . while i will not be generous to this film , i will begin this review by mentioning how proud i am of out cold . again , this was nowhere near a good film , but as a person that watches films on a consistent basis , i saw out cold as a film that tried really hard to be humorous , original , and creative , but just failed miserably . one must give credit to those films that fail while trying , because so many films today just , honestly , fail to try . unoriginality seems to be a common theme among these tween films , as big boobs , beer drinking , and cliché characters invade the screen more often than humorous dialogue that invades your mind and into modern culture . out cold aims towards a general audience that i despise . that audience is one that will pay top dollar for stupid humor that demonstrates no talent and a considerable lack of creativity . why do we , as audience members , do that ? is it that difficult for us to laugh at intelligent humor ? while out cold did not begin the trend in hollywood , it did contribute to it , and thus continuing films like date movie , american wedding , and dude , where 's my car to plague our theaters . i think i have spoken enough about my personal belief on why this film was a wart on the back of hollywood , so let 's look at actual reasons why this film tried and failed . i have to get this first one out in the open . why , painfully i ask this question , did the filmmakers see the quality in combining tween humor , snowboarding , and casablanca together in one film ? the first two matched , but the last was just pure rubbish . outside of an adult audience , not many children or teens would catch the classic hollywood film reference , thus completely ruining the remains of a dying film genre . now , when the audience of out cold actually connect casablanca to out cold , they will say lines like `` this movie is just like out cold '' . this makes me so angry . if parents would raise their children correctly in film most will say , `` out cold took quite a bit from casablanca '' , instead of the other way around . casablanca needs to come first . with that said , our biggest pitfall to this film was the characters . were there any ? great question ! i did n't see any . instead , i saw actors reacting to certain situations . there were no definitions to anyone . sure , one could argue that there were some `` characters '' with pig pen and inga , but when i see these moments , i see clichés , not characters . anyone can play a druggie , stoner , big-breasted woman , town idiot , and so forth , but it is how that actor chooses to redefine that overused character that really sets a film apart from the rest . nothing of the sort happened here . jason london was horrid as the title character , and his supposed girlfriend was as bland as illinois . jason 's friends were obnoxiously unexciting and lee majors walked on set , said his lines , and walked off . again , there was nothing of value . nobody went beyond the lines on their script , which ultimately hurt the overall viewing experience of this film . if i were to pick one element that kept this film from completely drowning would be the use of david koechner , of whom i can not help but laugh at whenever he opens his mouth . he is the prime example of what i was hoping the direction would be for these filmmakers . he was a unique character for bull mountain and thus created some of the better lines for the film , if only the rest of the cast would have taken his lead . yet , i do not blame the cast for it all , the filmmakers ( the malloy brothers ) had to make the underlying decision to either make another tween film , or sharpen the humor and aim towards a smarter audience . as you may or may not have noticed , they went with the latter . the entire `` king of the mountain '' bit was horrendous , not because of the storyline element , but the fact that everyone 's beer was flying , nobody recognized anyone , and only the characters we were familiar with were winners . just disrespectful to the rest of those that inhabits bull mountain . the funniest bit that i think the malloys were able to pull off were the brotherly pranks pulled when one was too drunk . the first one with the polar bear was not funny ( rather juvenile ) , but the one with the car continues to put a smile on my face . it was this type of humor that i was expecting the entire film , but overall continued to keep falling short . overall , out cold felt like your last pick to be your date for prom . sure , there were some elements that were decent enough to smile at , but most of the time you were embarrassed to be seen with her in public . i am tired of this tween genre of film , and while i know that due to an increasing decline in intelligence in our theaters we will only continue to see more of this type of movie , i am still tired of it . it is as if most directors are just using the `` cut & paste '' feature on their editing machines bringing us the same jokes that have been told once with success , but over time , they just become boring . again , i will say that of most of the films in this genre , out cold did try a bit harder to be beyond the mold , but in the end it was nothing spectacular . i do n't think i could muster the strength to watch it again . grade : ** out of ****
