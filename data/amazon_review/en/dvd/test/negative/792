good movie for under $ 3.00 i must say , this is n't the best of ralph bakshi . i bet the soundtrack would be worth more then the movie . there is some great songs , however there is no plot , there is no reasoning , and there is no action . like always , great animation by bakshi , but i know for sure the bakshi 's team could had really done better . 5 stars for the music , 2 stars for the film . i was n't upset for spending the 3 dollars
