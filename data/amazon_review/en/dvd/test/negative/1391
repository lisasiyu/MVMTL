deconstructing annie hall -- one of woody allen 's least memorable films `anything else ' reminds me of woody allen 's earlier masterpiece `annie hall ' in more than one way - a love romance in new york city , an aspiring comic writer , funny one-liners , jazz songs , and most of all , the choice of the hero/heroine who might or might not leave the city . the difference is that `anything else ' does n't achieve the level of humor and pathos of `annie hall . ' perhaps the film 's soulless touch might reflect allen 's own feelings about the city and filmmaking itself these days , and also explain this strangely weariness of the film that is very disappointing . jason biggs plays allen 's alter ego , young comedy writer jerry who really wants to write a serious novel . he struggles to make his dream come true for all this incompetent agent harvey ( danny devito ) and his frigid girlfriend amanda ( christina ricci ) who refuses to sleep with him ( for six months ) . perhaps some viewers would find these characters unlikely or worse , unlikable - and jerry and amanda are all living in a nice , clean room together in new york city , and afford to hear diane krall singing and stay in a hotel ( single room , $ 200 ) - well while we are watching these annoying and implausible characters , another irritating person arrives . it is amanda 's mom paula ( stockard channing ) , who 'tries ' something new ( here white powder ) ... like in 'annie hall . ' this formula of vintage woody allen comedy with eccentric characters might have worked in the 70s and 80s . actually , there are some funny jokes from allen himself , playing jerry 's mentor david dobel , but the film itself , especially the first part , is slow and boring . fast and snappy dialogues are not to be found , and the character of ricci , who fails to show the charm of a real coquette , is only irritating . actually , the casting itself is the real problem . jason biggs is not convincing as struggling jewish writer , and neither is ricci as whimsical heroine . i know it is too much to expect from them the chemistry between allen and diane keaton , and what is more embarrassing is that ricci is seen prowling in her underwear , as if compensate the lack of that credibility of romance . `anything else ' is definitely not meant for those who are going to watch woody allen films for the first time - in that case , he or she would never come back again -- nor for his devoted fans , who prefer his films with romance , humor , wit , and insightful observation about life . it took nearly three years for the film to be released in japan where i watched it , and now i know the reason for the delayed release
