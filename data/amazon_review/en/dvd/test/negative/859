another nicolas roeg train wreck ! there must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason , like it enough that this movie has been classified as a `` cult classic '' of sorts . obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the criterion collection , they have a cross selection of everything from the works of bergman , antonioni , fellini , godard to the bottom pit of hell with michael bay 's the rock and oh dear god , armageddon ! the man who fell to earth is therefore prime criterion fare , but is the film itself any good ? nicolas roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director . has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed ? this david bowie vehicle is no different with it 's oh so 70 's mileau . i especially love how time changes throughout the film , you see characters getting older except bowie who is an alien . decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970 's ! awesome , really ! it goes without saying that this film is another of roeg 's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise , capitalism , consumerist spending , etc . that these ideas are packaged so blatantly , ( the movie about alienation with an alien ! ) , and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema . if you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world , there is no better director than michaelangelo antonioni with l'avventura , la notte and l'eclisse for starters . nicolas roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent . the best part of this film is it 's sense of humor , it can be funny in a tacky , empty sort of way . plus we get lots of nudity and sex , so that 's fun , supposedly . directors by the 1970 's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible , because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition ! right ? ugh ... the dvd is high-quality criterion collection work , but the quality of the movie is your call . i find it to be utter junk but worth a look , you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life . nicolas roeg is a fraud , we have to face up to it
