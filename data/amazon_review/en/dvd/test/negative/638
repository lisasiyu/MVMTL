chick flick hell *warning : spoiler* i can not believe people , excuse me , some women are giving this movie four and five stars . interesting premise , and it could have been a good , believeable movie -- but it was sooo syrupy . if this is what it 's like to be in love , please somebody shoot me ( note : i 've been in real love for 27 years now . ) i got through the movie and probably would have given the movie a 3 and a half until the very end . why the blankity-blank-blank does somebody always have to die at or near the end for the movie to be a `` good movie '' ? i felt like i was drowning in estrogen by the time the movie was over . would n't it have been more intriquing to leave the movie somehow pondering how this new love was going to all work out ? that , at least , would have made the movie more intriquing , believeable and redeeming . if ever a movie was made to force tears , this is it . this movie stinks and i do n't mind telling you so -- and it 's not just because i 'm a man either . imo , there 's not much difference between this movie and a stupid , blatant steven segall movie where testosterone is promenaded around like it 's the elixir of heaven . same coin , different sides . the movie should be given a `` one '' -- no a `` negative one '' just for the stupid ending , but other redeeming factors make it a `` two . '' still not worth seeing -- i.e. , unless you 're into infuriating yourself . ** note : even my wife and daughter -- both chick-flick connousiours -- hate this movie.i have n't checked yet , but i think my dogs do too . ** another note : these two good actors needed a better movie . see ryan in the superb `` courage under fire '' , or the jim morrison movie , or `` when harry met sally '' -- which i do n't categorize as a `` chick flick '' but as a good romantic comedy , i.e. , not contrived
