i would n't recommend it to anybody . i like marlee matlin and some of the other dvds in the baby einstein series so was looking forward to this one . it is unfortunately not that great for teaching sign language ( i prefer both `` my baby can talk '' and `` signing time '' ) . the worst part of it is how long a child has to wait for the actual content ; there is no way to skip the commercial for `` disney 's little einsteins ''
