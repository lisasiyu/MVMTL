honorably courageous has everything : a remarkable true story of a determined hero and the love of family in making his accomplishment even more special . it makes you want to applaud his courage in many scenes , especially when he succeeds an incredibly painful test to stun his supervisory review board , winning their applaud as well . this is a do n't miss story told by tremendous acting throughout ... 20 star performances ! thank you for sending me a copy . -
