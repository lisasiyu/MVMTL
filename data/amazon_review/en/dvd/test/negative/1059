how , why , what , huh ? i was just waiting for this one to come out on dvd . voila ! it 's here and i rent it . god , oh god , oh god - this film had so much potential and super actors , but the story was so full of holes , i could 've drained my spaghetti in it ! not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered ! ! ! not a single one ! since i refuse to watch it again , i now have to go to bed asking myself if i did n't perhaps miss something . let 's go on the record here : acting - superb ( michael caine 's still got it ) ; filming - superb ; suspense - superb ; action -superb ; plot - as weak as my overcooked spaghetti . everything was there but the plot . like having my palate whet , without ever tasting the dish . frustrating , hmmm
