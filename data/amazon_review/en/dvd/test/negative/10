will the real herzog please emerge . this was so messy and mr. dorrington so over the top in hi self promotion . yuk . ! ..my partner and i were disgusted . he and his deceased friend/photographer are the rotten people who enter jungle animal habitats and cause the animals so much stress as to charge at them and these creeps can take photographs and brag-degenerates for sure.too damn bad for your buddy . it was obvious this was not quite of the caliber daring/bold/ and challenging as some of herzogs past films . we have been fans for 20+ years . looks like he did it for the money and dorrington rode herzogs coatails in a way . geez..i had just watched march of the penguins and wings of migration and those ! are truly documentaries made by film experts . the babbling and rambling on in the white diamond made me pity herzog . he did it for the $ maybe.dorrington yammers on and on in such a disgusting way i suggest you turn the sound off and fast forward to the end shots of the waterfall and the swifts . hey dorrington-who cares about you ? herzog..get out of california before you rot
