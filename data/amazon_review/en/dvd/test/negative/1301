old rehashed nfl films footage . i bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the 5 49er superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much . they just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the superbowls and just highlights of the game itself . there is special features of some players like young and rice but they are just interviews from 1999 and 1996 that originally aired on espn years ago . nothing new is on here just old nfl films shows that they made for espn . very disappointed . they most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game . terrible
