it is the exeption , not the rule , bad example the documentary is one of the few that fidel castro will allow to show on the communist cuban television . it shows the negative side of the balseros immigrants . completely pessimist and intentional depressing and some times it make fun about cubans . no a good example . the director picked a very poor town were everybody is black and unlettered . the other ninety percent of the rafter or balseros , not showed on this documentary of course , are mostly white , blue collar worker , professionals , and artists . i see then all the time . why this documentary does n't show to the world that cuban is the minority more represented on the highest levels of the united stated government . balseros that came here to work hard , learn the language , make money without selling drugs . it is the type of material that makes happy those that use to ware che gevara tee-shirt . i am sorry about my english , i am just a balsero that came here eight years ago and now i am american citizen , own a hause , have my own insurance business and most at all , i am free and proud to be a cuban balsero
