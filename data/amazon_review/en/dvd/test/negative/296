criterion misses the boat on this one i 'm fairly certain that most people who have seen this movie have seen it because debbie harry is in it . it is a thought-provoking movie which leaves a lot to the viewers ' discretion . is debbie harry real or is she just another `` videodrome '' hallucination ? i definately would n't say this is a `` fun '' movie either ... after watching it i felt dirty and sleazy , like i needed to take a long hot shower . anyway , since this is the big fancy `` criterion collection '' dvd , one would think that they would serve up the extra scenes which can be seen on the tv version of videodrome shown on on sci-fi etc.. but no , instead they give us the same version thats been in circulation since the days of vhs ! they do n't even include the extra scenes as bonus material . what a waste ! unless you are really anxious to hear james woods commentary ( debbie 's on there too , but does n't talk too much ) then i would save myself the extra $ 25 and just buy the old dvd version
