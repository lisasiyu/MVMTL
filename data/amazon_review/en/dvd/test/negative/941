when i was little i used to love vandamme , and it 's sad that he 's come to this ! i am in my twenties now and am more into drama films and trendy artistic films from foreign countries ( chalk that up to my wife 's influence on me ) , but i still have a guilty predeliction for unapologetically mindless action movies where things blow up , bad guys do bad things for no apparent reason , and ( of course ) a heroic character defeats countless enemies using martial arts and other cool fighting techniques , while those same countless numbers of villains fail to kill him despite firing millions of rounds of machine gun ammunition at him . i used to love van damme movies when i was aged 8-14 , back when he was making better films , although i 've always considered him a subpar actor ( the same is also true , in my opinion , for arnold swarzennegger ) . i thought his martial arts scenes in movies like bloodsport and kickboxer were worth the rental price ( or , in those days , asking my mom or dad to rent them for me ) . then came 1995 's timecop , and i absolutely loved that movie ( as a child -- now it seems kind of tame and not as good as i remembered it ) . i thought vandaame was finally becoming a better actor and fast on his way to being a megastar . unfortunately , vandamme 's career has faded since then , after a string of box-office and critical failures , and he has become more of a b-grade star and direct-to-video actor a-la michael dudinkoff ( american ninja ) . it 's good to see that he 's still working , but it seems like his work is really sucking right now . one exception might be 2000 's legionnaire , a vandamme movie that is surprisingly good , though certainly no hard target -- a movie from his glory days . for me , i think one of the biggest reasons why van damme is on a downward spiral as far as his movies go ( aside from his lousy acting ) is because he 's lost credibility as a martial arts virtuoso . i chalk this up to the time he allegedly got beat up at a nightclub . in the version i heard , van damme was purportedly behaving in an obnoxious manner in the club , and security naturally confronted him and asked him to moderate his behavior , or leave . van damme then allegedly began mouthing off at the security guard ( a beefy skinhead-looking guy ) and performing various martial arts moves apparently designed to intimidate the other guy . the other guy , i guess , was n't impressed because he then decked van damme with one right cross and van damme left the club on a stretcher . sigh . how the mighty have fallen . oh , by the way , second in command sucks .
