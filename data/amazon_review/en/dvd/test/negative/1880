hollywood costume epic , drama over substance this is another hollywood costume epic . they spared no expense with the set and costumes , hired talented big name actors rex harrison , liz taylor and richard burton . despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive . harrison was terrific as gaius julius caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and richard burton does not come across as a great mark antony . his character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by cleopatra , antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked ? although the film is titled cleopatra , it focuses more on the historic events . the film also reduces cleopatra to the woman depicted in octavian 's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent , a gifted political strategist , expert linguist , dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty . they do n't give you sense of what was so compelling about cleopatra . she is depicted as a combative shrew with both caesar and antony . i doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man . if you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here ? i would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as roman military leaders and the weak position of egypt compared to rome . given the limitations of their vision of cleopatra liz taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish , beautiful , seductive and glamorous temptress ; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance . although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you ca n't deny taylor 's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material . although taylor shines sadly we never get to know cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed hollywood costume drama . this movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance ; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50 's and sixties - the style reminds me of demille films like the ten commandments . it did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of taylor and burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit . the research , writing and the directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama . the real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great .
