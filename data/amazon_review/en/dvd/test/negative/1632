could 've been great ! i found this movie to be awful ! the pace could 've been kicked up , enabling the movie to flow together more cohesively . the scenes seemed to be disjointed , one minute here , the next minute there , but it did n't alleviate the drag of the story line . while it did capture the feel of the nfl , the uniforms , the people working on the sidelines , the coaches etc . the movie floundered when it attempted to get an important point across . this could 've been put together so much better
