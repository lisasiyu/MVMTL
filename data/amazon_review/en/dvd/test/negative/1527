i liked it ... alright 2 and 1/2 stars let me first start off by saying that richard gere is in my opinion a very so , so actor and in this movie , his crazy irish accent bugged me.and seemed forced . but , still , it 's a descent movie thanks to bruce willis , perfect for the vilain in this movie . jack black also makes a short cameo but bruce makes sure he does n't stay alive for long . the movie is basically about a prisoner released from prison to track down a man that only him and his girlfriend can identify . and then , comes a very average move with some good scenes . all resulting around bruce willis . the problem for me is that at times , i was n't cheering richard gere on whatsoever . that could have to do with his acting . on the other hand , willis is great and very effective and also..very cool . but , what looks like it 's going to be a good suspense movie ends out being like all action movies . and that my friend is something i seriously am tired of . now , that i think of it , i own this movie . you know what that means . hello blockbuster
