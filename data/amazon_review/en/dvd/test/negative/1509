yet another bad career choice for colin firth whose excellent acting is the only merit of this messy film nothing is wrong with `trauma ' as far as the actors and technical aspects are concerned . colin firth shows compelling acting as the suffering protagonist who survived a car accident , and john mathieson 's noir-ish cinematography is simply riveting . except that , however , `trauma ' is likely to leave most audiences only puzzled and unsatisfied after the end credits roll . as for the film itself , it goes on and on without giving me during its course any sense of mystery , drama , character study , or whatever that is worth spending my time . colin firth plays ben , who wakes up from a coma that lasted one week after his car crash that killed his wife elisa ( naomie harris , '28 days later ' ) . in spite of the constant therapy and the presence of a lovely girl named charlotte ( mena suvari ) , ben 's mental condition gets worse and worse , and he begins to suspect that what he sees and remembers does not necessarily reflect the reality that everyone else shares . in addition to the premise that is no longer original , the film introduces a murder case of internationally famous actress ( or singer ... sorry i forgot which ) that does not convince me at all . and the most surprising thing is , ben might be the prime suspect of the murder ! but how ? and why ? the script is laden with so many bits that do not simply gel - beside the things i pointed out above , ben must meet a seer ( played by brenda fricker ) who says something very predictable , and his estranged sister who is just forgettable . there are also big red ants crawling all over , paintings that imply nothing special , and the cctv surveillance images that only remind that the film is set in uk . all these gimmicks are used in the short films directed by film school students . the difference is , probably they know what they are doing better . i simply detest the ending that only wants to be shocking ( which it is not ) , and sincerely wish that mena suvari find a new agent who can help her out of the string of bad career choices that are getting more and more serious damages to her career these days
