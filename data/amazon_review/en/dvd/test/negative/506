left a bad taste i searched for reviews of this movie before i saw it , and did n't find any . people i talked to had not seen it , but had heard it was good . so i finally sat down and watched it . the acting was top notch . it was a tightly scripted chick flick about two friendships . one in a nursing home , and one in the friendship retold by cleo threadgoode during those visits . on the down side it was very feministic , to the point of portraying men in general of being evil ogres . women would be up in arms about any similar one sided portrayal of women . kathy bates ' character went from being a trampled by everyone woman to a `` do n't push me '' type . while much of this was funny , this was one extreme to the other rather than a middle ground . in spite of this i enjoyed the first part of the movie . that is until the surprise ending . while this gives away a bit of a plot spoiler , the ending involved unwitting cannibalism . this made me sick , and i felt sick a long time after watching it . had i known how sour the ending would be , i never would have watched this movie
