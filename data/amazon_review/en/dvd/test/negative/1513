great setting and premise but fails badly at delivering any substance ... i took a shot on this movie figuring that the concept was relatively fresh and i have been into thrillers lately . so , i tried it . the scenery was terrific , the setup had lots of promise , and the cinematography was eerie . so , what went wrong ? easy ... . the plot was empty and as others have stated , nothing ever really came of anything . there were a few build-ups with various characters discovering things in the hospital or finding out secrets but hardly any of it amounted to anything and this was disappointing . again , great camera work and the building was truly creepy ... . but thats not what makes a great thriller . you have to have a solid story and believable suspense tactics and there simply werent any . and the characters ... .uggggh ! the film tried desperately to develop each of the main characters but in most cases they were hard to care about and a few of them i would have gladly enjoyed seeing get killed in a slow , painful way . go ahead and try it if you 'd like but i suspect that you will be underwhelmed as this film tries to make a feature length adventure/thriller out of a few cool wide-pan hallway shots and strange voices . ultimately , it fails as a thriller and has a very light plot and mostly annoying characters . its not the worst i 've seen but it let me down as the expectations were pretty high after the first half hour . not recommended
