blue christmas i 'm a sucker for anything christmas . i generally have decent taste in movies the rest of the year , but come christmas-time , i lap up these sappy movies . but even i could n't stomach this one . the screenplay and the acting were so pathetic that the entire time i was watching it i wondered if this was made as a result of a bet that a christmas movie could be written and shot in 3 days that suckers like me would buy . what a waste of money & time
