rhymes with `` lame '' this paint-by-numbers new zealand film is a rote coming-of-age / adultery flick in which a family living by the seaside is put in moral jeopardy by a handsome stranger . throughout the film , i kept asking myself how the parents in this nuclear unit could spend so much time at their dream house without working a steady job . instead , it appears that everyone involved has far too much time on their hands and found that drinking themselves into oblivion will only do so much to ease the boredom . yes , mom ( sarah perise ) has a booze problem and the hots for the boat-bound stranger ( marton csokas ) . meanwhile , dad ( alistair browning ) sits cuckolded in the back yard sipping hard liquor . their two kids ( alicia fulford-wierzbicki and aaron murphy ) do n't have healthy hobbies either ; spending their time cutting private parts out of porn magazines and taping them to their bodies . i suppose there is a lot of `` higher meaning '' going on between these `` adult parts '' and the lemon tree that grows in their back yard . however , i really was n't inclined to dig deep in this overly glossy film whose plot and ending were visible from the onset . director jeffs muddies her water with an overabundance of slow motion shots , drawing out the tedium of rain . instead of treading new ground , the film provides the audience with trite morality and one-dimensional characters
