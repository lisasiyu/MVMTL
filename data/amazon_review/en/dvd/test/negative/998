absolutely waste of money ! ! i bought this dvd a while back from amazon . i was very disappointed with the dvd . it 's a joke ! , really . he was worse than the beginner dancer . i watched the dvd for about 5 minutes and it made me sick thinking that i paid for this ? . i will not accept this if someone give it to me for free . if you 're serious in learning salsa , the new york salsa dvd series are very good . do n't waste your money on this one !
