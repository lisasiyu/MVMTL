very disappointed and frustrated personally , i found this workout extremely difficult to follow ; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood . after pushing myself to go back to every part i did n't understand , i grew frustrated . other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition , as i have obviously tried , but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill , both of which i believe are integral to any workout . and in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output ; one should n't have to teach themselves the moves . to a less significant degree , i agree with the reviews that comment on the `` cheesiness '' of the video . at first , such cheesiness made me laugh , and then as i grew frustrated , it merely made me further annoyed . what i feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor marie forleo 's unsuccessful motivation attempts , which are not only redundant , but suggestive in a most unnecessary way . i do n't mean to sound so aggressively negative -- i just wish i had been able to learn the moves , because they did look like fun
