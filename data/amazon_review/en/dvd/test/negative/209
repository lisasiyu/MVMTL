the problem with `` alien quadrilogy '' is that only the first two films worth to be seen . 1979 `` alien '' by director ridley scott and 1986 `` aliens '' by director james cameron , are the only movies of this success fox franchise , that really were extraordinary films . `` alien '' is consider one of the most extraordinary horror movies of all times , mean while `` aliens '' is considered one of the best sci-fi movies of all times . sadly for the saga , the people of fox did a very bad job hiring david fincher to direct `` alien 3 '' and the french guy jean-pierre jeunet who direct `` aliens resurrection ''
