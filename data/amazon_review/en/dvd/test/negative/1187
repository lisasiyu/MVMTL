northanger abbey video review this is one of the weirdest video adapatations of a novel i 've ever seen . the novel was an early work by jane austen ( published posthumously ) so it 's not as well crafted as later works . despite the novel 's weaknesses , however , even this video production does not do it justice . the heroine looks like she 's on heroin , maj. tinley ( played by the same guy who played the older doctor in `` all creatures great and small '' ) is positively creepy , his son , henry tilney , smirks instead of smiles , the thorpe sister is just plain ugly ( i should say she 's just plain plain ) and the tilney sister is a stiff . i ca n't remember whether other videos of this novel were available and this is the one i chose or whether there was no other choice . the only value the video had for me was it helped establish who the characters were and their relationships -- before i read the book . as they say , `` the book was better , '' and in this case , the old saying could n't be more true
