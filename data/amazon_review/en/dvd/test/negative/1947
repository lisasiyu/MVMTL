oh so sincere , oh so bad ! stanley kramer was a competent filmmaker who had a progressive , liberal point of view , often way before it was fashionable , on almost all social issues . it 's hard to look at some of his films today without groaning , but they are all well meaning , if often way past gooey . except for `` judgement at nuremberg '' and maybe `` inherit the wind '' , all of them seem badly dated . the worst of the lot , `` guess who 's coming to dinner '' is almost unwatchable . the screenplay by leonard rose ( which , unbelivably , won an academy award ! ) seems out of step even for the 60 's . the plot is ludicrous and patronizing ; the biracial couple is so perfect one would think they landed from another planet . did mr. poitier have to be a doctor ? why not president ? there is never the slightest doubt as to what is going to happen next in this film . all of the characters are stock , the storyline totally predictable and banal . for those suffering from a.d.d. , poor spencer tracy gives a nice , long , sweet speech at the end which summarizes , verbatim , everything you 've just had to suffer through the past hour and a half . the acting , except for beah richards , is uniformly bad ( though with this story no one , not even mr. tracy , has a chance to do anything other than be cute ) .ms . houghten was pretty but talently challenged.ms . hepburn is especially dreadful in what is actually a rather small part . this was the start of the teary eyes , quivering chin ( i am not referring to her neurological disorder ! ) , `` oh , i know you all love me ! '' phase of her career . her eyes are very slanty in this film and one can see the scars of a recent face lift when she is seen in profile . her close ups are all sort of hazy ; kind of like lucille ball in `` mame '' . ms. hepburn always seemed strong and proud and unbeatable when she was younger , or at least until , `` guess who 's coming to dinner '' . athough always somewhat actressy and prone to posing , she was always smart and likable and sometimes very effective , especially in comedies . i do n't know why she chose to go down the saccharine path as she got older . it 's very sad that mr. tracy ( the most spendid and natural screen actor of his time ) had to end his distinguished career in this embarrassing pile of glop . i immediately watched `` woman of the year '' and `` adam 's rib '' after viewing `` guess who 's coming to dinner '' so i would remember how wonderful almost all of the other tracy/hepburn movies were .
