schlock , not shock this is an unbelievably bad film . its only redeeming features are the snippets of actual killer gary ridgeway 's police interviews that are ocassionally spliced into the film 's tawdry , fictionalized action scenes . i had n't known this footage of gary ridgeway existed . a documentary consisting only of these interviews would have been infinitely more interesting than this trumped up movie . the movie does n't even minimally seem to care about accuracy or authenticity . for example , the extremely amateurish actor who plays ridgeway does n't match the real ridgeway 's physical description at all . the real ridgeway was not a `` tall , handsome , muscular '' fellow . he was shorter , and unassuming-looking . also , the majority of ridgeway 's victims were not the glamorous , seasoned barroom prostitutes shown here . they were lonely , struggling teenagers whom he picked up along the seatac highway . if you want a better insight into the character of ridgeway 's victims and crimes , read ann rule 's book , `` green river , running red . '' in any case , avoid this movie mess .
