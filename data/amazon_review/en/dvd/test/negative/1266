not what my daughter expected my 4-year old daughter fell in love with mlp after watching the `` princess promenade '' dvd , so when we saw this , we scooped it up . after watching princess promenade though , watching this was torture . the animation and audio are so poorly done . every story has a scary character that terrified my 4-year old . the cover resembles the princess promenade disk as far as imagery , but does n't match the video at all . it seems deceptive . only after my dissapointment did i note the 1987 production date . if i can return this , i will , because my daughter is too scared to watch it
