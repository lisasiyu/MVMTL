please let it be the final final destination 3 is hopefully the final installment to this series . they have all been entertaining , gory , and clever but the charm has finally worn off for me personally . the acting has never been first rate , horror movies rarely offer oscar worthy performances . the formula has always been followed , someone gets a vision saves others from a terrible fate than one by one they all hand in their `` get out of death `` free card to the grim reaper . the main characters must figure out the order of death , and maybe cheat it making it skip and therefore end the cycle completely . by this third movie , it seemed to me the kill scenes were just getting a bit forced and completely unbelievable even for a supernatural causation . the tanning beds , the nail gun , the motor chopping off heads , and the exercise equipment were just off from the first two movies genius . the extra feature where you can decide their fate with your remote was a waste of time , i do n't understand even putting it on there unless they really had changed some of the fates ( besides the one dude with the stupid hat , which when saved just disappears and it makes no sense ) i have read other reviews on here , and i have to agree with whomever pointed out that the pictures before the rollercoaster should n't have showed their grim fates , if they all were supposed to die on the ride , did death know she would save them ? if so than that changes everything , its not really cheating death than is it ? oh well , anyway , watch this if you have some free time , and if you liked the first two , its an okay , hopefully the end to this played out series .
