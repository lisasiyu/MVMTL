perhaps the most overrated film ever i 've seen this several times over the years and still ca n't make sense of why it 's such a favorite . the acting is subpar , the drama cheesy and in my opinion as an active duty sailor , fails quite miserably to capture the true spirit of being in the navy . to think that lunatic tom cruise practically built a career off of this garbage ... sigh..
