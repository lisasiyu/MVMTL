big disappointment i was excited about this dvd because of the customized workout feature , but i could n't even make it through a preview . the instructor 's voice is grating . she sounds similar to denise austin so if you , like me , are sensitive to voice tone : be warned . and then there 's the unsettling psuedo-mansion parlor background complete with pillars and fireplace which , to my mind , is entirely wrong for a yoga routine . if you 're looking for a yoga dvd with a customized workout feature , i 'd recommend the beautifully filmed and excellently instructed `` yoga shakti '' by shiva rea
