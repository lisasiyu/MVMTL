always raunchy , often disgusting , rarely funny and definitely not worth buying . this movie dishes out nastiness that makes friday the 13th seem quaint and lovable by comparison . jay and silent bob are rotten people , and you will feel rotten after watching this fitlth . you might laugh a time or two , but you wo n't feel good about doing it .
