typical wackness how in the world that dave chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery ? ? so now that he choked a 50 million dollar pay day away he got smart & knows he does n't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place . this is a insult to wattstaxx . that documentary from 1973 was important this is just a mess . the music acts on here are lame as well . you want the big acts of today not no milk carton , has-beens or non-hit having acts . the only thing funny about this film is that it got made & was released . glad his corny show is no more . good riddence . this movie is equally bad as well .
