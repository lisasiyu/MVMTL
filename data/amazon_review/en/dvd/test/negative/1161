a disappointment ... ugh ... not recommended . for those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a s/m relationship , i would highly suggest the japanese film , `` moonlight whispers '' over `` maitresse . '' that film is a gentle coming-of-age film with male sub/fem dom theme , while `` maitresse '' is a somewhat confused film about an ex-con who stumbles into a dungeon and a ( highly unlikely ) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix . the ex-con can not deal with `` her career '' eventually and threatens her to quit , etc . ( at some point , you get the idea that the director himself really does n't understand where the domina is coming from . ) what started out as an interesting film with a provacative opening soon falls apart about halfway through . the writer/director seems to lose the narrative thread of the film and things degenerate with the ex-con wanting to buy the dominitrix out from her protection ( or pimp , for want of a better word ) . then , we watch as the ex-con -- in a totally unrelated and gratuitous foray -- goes to a slaughterhouse , where a real horse is shown killed onscreen , strung up and stabbed and drained of blood as it kicks helplessly ( this image will upset you for weeks , believe me ! [ i feel like it 's my duty to warn you ! ] ) . and the film gets even worse from there and finally ends up with a ridiculous car accident and the two main characters laughing like idiots . totally stupid ( like the writer/director suddenly ran out of ideas ) . believe me , i really wanted to like this movie . i ignored the negative reviews , because there are so few `` real '' films on this subject . but i was sorely disappointed and depressed by it . if you need to see this film , rent it . it 's definitely a `` one view '' film at best ; and it will be a film that will leave you angry ( because the horse scene ) and vaguely disgusted -- and generally bummed out . too bad . `` moonlight whispers '' is a much better , respectful treatment of s/m , a film with real characters and nuance -- one that seeks to explore real psychological ( and sexual orientation ) questions , while also being a beautiful film to watch . that film deserves to be seen -- and a wider audience !
