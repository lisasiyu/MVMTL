warning : this is what will happen if gay marriage goes nationwide ! ! ! ! just kidding . actually , massachusetts has nothing to worry about . the people in this movie have as much in common with normal humans as martians would ( an effect fellini was deliberately going for ) . the only reason i rented this disc is because john lennon once said that the beatles ' life on tour was like fellini 's satyricon . i can only hope that the fab four 's nights in australia , the philippines , and japan were more fun than this movie . more a collection of images than anything resembling a coherent narrative , satyricon ( just how does one pronounce it anyway ? ) bets eveything on its visuals . some work and are impressive , but after a half hour , even diehard film buffs will tire of watching fellini try to top himself every five minutes . i hated fellini 's la dolce vita . but , being a good sport , i decided to give the famed italian director one more shot by watching this . i do n't think i want to go for strike three anytime soon . one could pretty much watch the scenes in any order . as an added annoyance , it looks like all the voices were dubbed after filming , just like they did in the spaghetti westerns . since there are no likable characters or interesting plot twists , one only has imagery to go on . so , let me describe the movie in montage form . we see large slabs of meat , bonfires , fat pedophiles , fat homosexuals , thin homosexuals , a beautiful slave girl with an annoying voice , an annoying poet with a beautiful voice . there are midgets , galley slaves , oily wrestling matches , a sweaty minotaur , heads chopped off , mutilations , suicides , a man swinging from a noose , lots of froliking , little real sex and no eroticism , an earthquake , sabers , centaurians , dusty vistas , squeaky wagons , a pasty-faced demi-god , painted woman , painted men , loin cloths , art work , and as cosmo kramer once said , lots of unbridled enthusiasm . what does it all add up to ? two hours and ten minutes of your time wasted . if you want great imagery in a foreign film , stick with werner herzog 's work .
