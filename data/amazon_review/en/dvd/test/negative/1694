blu-ray screws us here ! the blu-ray disc is supposed to have 5 times more memory than standard dvd . so why ca n't they release all the special features ( and more if possible ) that the standard dvd has ? i do n't know if it 's a product , copyright , or money issue , but this has n't yet happened on hd dvd . the standard dvd of this movie has full-length audio commentary , 15 minutes of extended fight sequences with optional commentary , a behind-the-scenes documentary , a storyboard-to-film comparison , and a sneak peek at the making of the second `` transporter . '' none of that is on this blu-ray . so if you 're a real movie buff and like special features , get the standard dvd of this movie
