go with the editor 's review ! ! after reading the editor 's review i was ready to dismiss this movie even as a huge buffy / angel / bones fan . then i read all the other reviews and reconsidered . editors often pan movies i end up liking , so i thought i 'd try it . i 'm actually somewhat surprised that i did n't just give up halfway through . this movie was terrible . the plot was idiotic , the three girls annoying , and it was n't worth watching even to just see david on the screen . go with the editor 's review and stay away - especially if your a boreanaz fan ! what bet did he lose to be forced to do this role ? ! ?
