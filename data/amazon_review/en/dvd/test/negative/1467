utter trash ( worst slasher film ever created ) i saw this movie on on demand and i would have to say it is the worst slasher film i had ever seen . the characters are really bad in this movie . the killer is a boney 115 5'5 girl . the way she kills people is so weak . she beat a guy up with a large stick but it looks so weak . it does not even look like it would hurt you . and he some how dies . the movie also made it seem like she kills only bad guys bad guys but she kills everyone . most of them did nothing . do n't know why the director seem to hint that she kills only the bad . and it is not even scary at all . it takes place for the most part in the day time . and the killer is the main character making no suspense at all . i would recommend to everyone to aviod this movie at all cost . it is so stupid . i really do n't see what the priase the other reveiws gave is all about . all i can say is it is utter trash ! ! ! !
