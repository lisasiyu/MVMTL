bogged down liz hurley has her top off 4 or 5 times ; there is incest , lesbian love between sisters-in-law , the main character 's husband is having an affair with his brother 's girlfriend who really is n't his brother 's girlfriend , she really is his girlfriend that was coming along on the boat trip pretending to be his brother 's girlfriend so she could meet his wife who happens to be having some psychic connection with a `` solved incorrectly '' murder from 125 years ago on an island with some norwegian people . and honest to god the movie is boring . sean penn broods , leers , pains , and smokes cigarettes , his wife is played by catherine mccormack who is like a young charolette rampling , very watchable but condemned to a weak role ; liz hurley acts very vampy and takes her top off ( unforgettable ) : all this and the movie drags , and drags . liz stops taking her top off at the 1/3 mark which then forces you to realize how bad the movie is . the parallel stories just do n't come off . actually it is a one star movie , liz taking her top off boots it one extra star
