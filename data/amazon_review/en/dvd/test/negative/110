first rule of the fight club - you must be a white male to love this movie this movie was very much like american beauty , except it was a little better . this kind of dark comedy is made for white men who have lost their souls to the modern american life . but for all other people , including myself , fight club was not that good . and i get the movie . i am a consumer , like most americans . but not to a degree where i can relate to jack who is the main character . starting a fight club to re-discover masculinity or one 's identity is an absurd idea . what is sad is the fact that so many white men are facinated by the whole idea of fight club . no wonder the only people that joins the fight club in the movie are white males . no wonder that the only real people in my life that i saw raving about this movie so far has been all `` white men '' . the movie does speak one truth . modern american life has reached a point of sickness that a movie like this drawn a significant number of fans . like i said , i have not come to that point yet and i do plenty of things to make my life significant and meaningful . people should build a family , serve their community , and make real friends to live a happy and significant life . fight club is not necessary unless you really became like jack . do not watch this movie unless you are white male . watch if you are really curious , but it will be a waste of time
