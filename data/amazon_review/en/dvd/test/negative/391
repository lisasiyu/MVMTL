hmm this movie is for liberals what the left behind book series is for christian conservatives , it portrays reality how they want to see it . its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much pc political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it . entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall imo
