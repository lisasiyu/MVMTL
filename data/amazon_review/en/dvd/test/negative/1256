semi-thrilling thriller this film is so stupid that when different locations in quebec are shown the captions read `` st. jovite , canada '' or montreal , canada '' like mentioning quebec would be too complicated for the retarded masses this film is intended for . angelina jolie plays her smug little self with pitiful dialogue as usual lately . but i will say that i am happy that she went to see an expos game while in montreal ... and that she shows us some skin here . the kid at the begining of the film who plays the killer is so annoying ! ! ! someone needs to steal his john lennon glasses and kick his ass before he ruins yet another film . one bonus in here is that marie-jose croze is in it albeit briefly . she should have been the lead . she 's hotter than angelina and a better actress ( see munich ) . this film is also beneath jean-hugues anglade who plays a detective and can act circles aroun ethan hawke any day of the week
