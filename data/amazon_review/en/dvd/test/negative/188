george later hated this series ... . it 's a little known fact but george peppard later said in interviews that he hated this series , frequently did not get along with his co-stars ( particularly mr.t ) and hate the child scripts that stephen candell would turn out each week . it 's easy to see why , two of the actors ; mr.t and dirk benedict really could not act and did not work on anything big after this show fizziled out in 1985 . dwight schultz did continue to work and turned up in supporting roles in various tv movies and films , so he at least had some acting talent to speak of , but really the only real star of this series was george peppard , and his more memmorial tv work should be as the private insurance investigator , benecheck .
