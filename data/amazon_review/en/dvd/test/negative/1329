i think robert stack wandered in from another movie this is not a `` typical '' fuller effort . he goes for the cinemascope view of post war japan , pictures of blossoms and mt fuji and is lumbered with that sorry excuse for a performer , robert stack with his mannered wanderings - whether in a hurry or standing still he seems to be strolling along - and his full range of expressions from a to b . the drama gets to be placed secondary to the scenery and the suspense likewise droops much as i imagined ms yamaguchi 's desire drooped at the thought of giving mr stack a massage . boy what a let down . mr ryan does his professional best but hey , he 's always a trooper worth watching . mr godard allegedly thought this was fuller 's best film - if so he must have been high on some illegal substance at the time . no no nannette ? no no noir
