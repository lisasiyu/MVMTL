these cats just lip sing ... . i 'm a huge bone fan and i expected a great dvd and it has many performances but the catch is that they lip sing on all there performances . so when they perform on stage they basically sound the same as our cd 's we have of them . the only performance that they actually rap in this dvd is the 1996 mtv awards and you can clearly tell the difference . but to bone 's credit that performance was hot because they actually did rap . if it was n't for that great performance this would 've got 1 star . and the backstage seens were short and worthless basically . so even if your a huge bone fan its not really worth it cause of the reasons mentioned ...
