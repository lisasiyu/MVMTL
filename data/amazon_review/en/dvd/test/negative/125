murder she wrote -- second season the disks in this set are double sided and there are problems . one or two of the episodes are unreadable . we returned the first set , which had an entire unreadable side on one of the cd 's . the replacement was better , but not perfect . the single sided cd 's in other sets are much better and highly reliable as to quality . double sided just have built in flaws and i wish they would discontinue them .
