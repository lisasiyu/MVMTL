not as good as it could be ! this is a nice story with lots of dramatic scenery but it is full of inconsistencies that really ruin the movie . the main character 's hair is short , then in scenes that happen a day or two later it is very long , then the next day it is short again . when one person gets buried in the graveyard , it is located downhill by the water . when another person gets buried in the same graveyard , it is up on top of a hill . it is very hard to concentrate on the plot , characters , etc . when this is happening all the time . but two stars for being a good story and having nice scenary
