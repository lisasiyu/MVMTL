disappointment of a life-time ... ... ... ... ... and i guess along , i knew it would be ! ! ! dark shadows 1966-71 is the only dark shadows . period. ! ! ! there is no.. nor ... ever can be a `` revival '' of the original ... sorry ! `` revival '' was a very forgettable attempt by dan curtis ( genius ) to desparately cling on to an old idea ... and i do n't blame him , cause it ' is my favorite show of all time , but by the 90 's , the people and the mood was altogether different fom the 60 's ... cast and acting not of 66-71 caliber , destined to fail because of that alone ... was time to seal the old coffin up 1n 1971 ... and not be disturbed in '90 or '91 or whenever the heck it was .
