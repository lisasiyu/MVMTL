ambush bay -- not art ambush bay is not art . it is not entertainment . it is not even interesting . ambush bay is without a doubt one of the worst wwii movies ever produced . the best part of this movie is robert mitchum 's red cap , worn while he is in the philippine jungle hiding from japanese soldiers . red cap ... . why not wear universal orange ? i 've seen the movie twice . once with the sound on . it was awful . i watched it again , with the sound off . it was better this second time . it had the feel , without sound , of an ok comedy . with the sound it was pathetic . do n't both buying it . spend your money on something more useful or entertaining .
