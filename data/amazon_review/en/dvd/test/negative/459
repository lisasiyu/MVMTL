hey , did any of you dudes catch that they ripped off the plot from clueless ? this is the poorest of the plethora of jane austen adaptations we have undergone the past decade , with gwyneth paltrow stumbling her way through an unfunny retelling of austens classic . fortunately its been 3 weeks since i watched this and ive managed to put the details of why i found it distasteful into the nether regions of my mind , but it was a mess .
