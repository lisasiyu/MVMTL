watch this if there 's nothing good on tv i love trouble is a lightweight romantic comedy of helium-filled proportions . it is effectively a vehicle for everyone 's favourite movie darling of the early 1990s , julia roberts , to have some fun and look lovely while getting one up on the dastardly male lead played by nick nolte . nolte plays peter brackett , a veteran newspaper columnist for the respected chicago chronicle . ever the ladies man , brackett can do little wrong in the eyes of the bevy of woman he attracts , his loyal readers , and even his grumpy editor . he manages to fly by the seat of his pants with deadlines looming and get his stories filed on time , every time ( even if it does mean plagiarising himself ! ) . having just released a novel , brackett is about to hit the book tour circuit , and life is looking good for this charming , yet slightly sleazy bachelor . this is of course until journalistic competition , in the form of the lovely sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) , comes along with her quick wit , sharpened pencil , keen nose for a story , and obligatory short skirt . in the end , this film runs out of steam and the ludicrous and contrived ending is probably 30 minutes too late in arriving . the actual train crash plot becomes secondary to the romantic battle between the two leads , which rarely sparks into anything other than light-hearted banter and some clich√©d one-liners . there are plenty of awfully large plot holes in the story , some wide enough to fit julia roberts ' smile through sideways , and you will probably find yourself laughing out loud at some of the contrived scenarios . if it was an effort to recapture some of the past glories from the screwball comedies of the late 1930s , it failed miserably .
