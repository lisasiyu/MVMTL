once again a king story is ruined on film in the short story collection night shift , mr.king gave us some of his best short stories and spawned at least 6 movies that i know of ( this mess , trucks ( twice once by king as `` maximam overdrive '' and once as a t.v . movie ) , night surf , the boogyman ( not the new one ) , graveyard shift , the mangler , and maybe more and not one has been done right ! this one misses by a mile as it tells of the cult of kids who kill all the adults in a town and serve `` he who walks behind the rows '' more like `` we steped in something behind the rows '' and we steped in this flameing piece of junk ! ! ! skip it ! ! ! ! ! !
