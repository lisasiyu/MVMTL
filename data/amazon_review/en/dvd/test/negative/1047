awesome movie , lame hd dvd the movie is awesome - 5 stars . hd dvd transfer looks grainy ( digital noise ) and the colors are off and washed out . as crazy as it sounds , it looks worse then i remember it on vhs . anyway , the standard dvd is better than this on an upconvert dvd player . really dissapointing ... .
