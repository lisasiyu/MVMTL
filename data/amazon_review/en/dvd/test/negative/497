good but german version from amazon.de is better ... ..than uk se just received the german 4 disc digipak . good news . played 10 mins of both - no problems . menus are all in english ( or german ) all the extra 's on the english r2 se 's are here except for the photo gallery . the sound is very good and the restored english mono is better than the mgm 5.1 also on here with the commentary and german mono . the 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation . picture . no problems i could see on my 6ft screen via infocus 5700 projector from an arcam fmj-dv29 dvd player . player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything . only watched first 10mins of each but doing a-b comparisons with the english r2 mgm se 's the german ones are noticeably better , they look less washed out , contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on fistful , which is why i bought this set , but also on few dollars more as well . they are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly few dollars more is at last the full version , which no mgm dvd is worldwide ... ..
