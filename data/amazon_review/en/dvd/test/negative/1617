losers ' row it was the sixties , and anyone with long hair and a shambling , preoccupied air of sensitivity could get money to make a movie . that 's how michael sarne , director of this colossally misguided effort , was able to get the job . sarne was one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie . in fact , the whole studio must have been on acid to agree to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film , a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called joanna . that film starred the similarly talentless and painfully twee actress/waif genevieve waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter . sarne , who was probably incapable of directing traffic in a supermarket aisle never mind a big-budget hollywood film , was in way over his head . if the film looks horribly amateurish , that 's because it is . if there is an historical marker indicating the superficiality and shallowness of an era , myra breckinridge provides that marker . it embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic . breckinridge is a touchstone of another , equally important vein : the debasement of culture . watch this movie and you 'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years . many reviewers have spoken about the intercutting of footage from other , older ( and better ) films . some actually liked these clunky `` comments '' on what was taking place in the movie , others found them pointless , annoying , and obtrusive , though since the film is so bad itself , any intrusion would have to be considered a welcome relief . in my opinion , the real reason michael sarne put so many film clips into myra brekinridge was not a subversive and avant guard sensibility , but a paucity of invention , the clips were inserted in a last-ditch effort to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed . that is to say , sarne was so artistically-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time . they were n't inspiration , they were desperation . his writing skills were virtually nonexistent , and screenwriter david giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb , so sarne was left to try and make a movie , and he could n't . it was beyond his slim capabilities . hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film 's worth of clips . the ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because sarne sure as heck was n't able to . this was what he came up with on those days he sat in a corner of the set and `thought ' for eight hours while the entire cast and crew ( not to mention the studio brass , the producers , and the accountants ) cooled their heels and waited for something , some great spark of imagination , a hint of originality , a soupcon of wit to crackle forth from the brimming skull of zeus . um , oops . no zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each fashioned from the dozens of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window . bye-bye , baby , bye-bye . as for myself , i hated the film clips . they denigrated sarne 's many betters and poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the lilliputian abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration , originality , and just plain competency when compared to even the cheesiest of them . the film was doomed the day he was hired , and a very funny and original book by gore vidal became the jerky , manic , and supremely unfunny ( except when it was n't trying to be ) myra breckinridge , the meltdown .
