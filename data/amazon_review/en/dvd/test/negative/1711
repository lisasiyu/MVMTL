an opportunity wasted ... i saw the amityville remake last night . i absolutely loved the original even if it did n't age well over time . i think what made the original so good was that the characters who played the leads really looked frightened e.g . james brolin , margot kidder and rod steiger really conveyed fear in their eyes . the newer version stars ryan reynolds , who is more renowned for comedy and melissa george , an australian actress who started her career in daytime soaps . philip baker hall plays the priest fr callaway . it would be unfair to describe the acting as incompetent , it is n't . my main problem is with the plot and the way the film unravels . the opening sequence shows the massacre of the defoe family by ronnie the son who goes mad . this is quite a creepy sequence and uses similar imagery to the film se7en . it sets the scene nicely . then we cut forward to the lutz family who snap up the property and are told of the house 's history . after initial reluctance , they decide to move in and give it a go . then the weird things start to happen like the apparition to the lutz daughter of jody defoe , the girl who was murdered by her brother a year before . there are one or two jump out of the seat moments after this but i consider the film to be a wasted opportunity overall the film turns into a budget version of the shining , concentrating on the declining sanity of george lutz played by ryan reynolds . this insanity builds up until the end of the film where he comes to his senses and the family escape the house . in the original , the insanity of the lutz father is only one of several episodes to befall the family in the house . gone is the appearance of the demon pig , the secret room behind the fireplace painted in blood and other such episodes . most disappointing was the brief appearance of philip baker hall , an actor who is normally excellent at conveying distress ( remember him as the dying quiz show host in magnolia ? ) .i expected lots more from his appearance in the house than the swarm of flies attacking his face ? i suppose one of the main problem with the film is it 's brevity . it clocks in at under 90 minutes in runtime . what starts out as a very eerie film ends up another shlock horror zombie film . it could have been so much better really .
