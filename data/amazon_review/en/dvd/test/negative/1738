overt child exploitation that never redeems itself satisfyingly a well-acted , well-portrayed , sickening , overt example of an adult whose sole desire for a child is based on getting that child to meet his own selfish needs . he has little or no love for the child based on who the child is in her core , and sends her the basic message that she does not count as a human being aside from being an object to gratify him . if the child does not mold to his expectations and desires she gets rejected , and this is the horrible tension of the movie . although the movie has some twists and turns that shake things up , the man 's character never develops much in a satisfying way , and nor do the basic themes of adult selfishness and cultural repression . as such the movie is essentially non-redemptive , and portrays a sad and tragic side of humanity . although this movie is set in an outer province on china in the 1930s , it 's actually a good metaphor for western culture , much as western cultural norms do not allow parents to exploit their children so overtly..
