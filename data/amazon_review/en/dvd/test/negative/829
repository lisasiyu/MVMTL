lack of the depth and profoundness of those original 26 movies what made the original 26 zatoishi movies as one of the best creations in japanese movie history was its profoundness , the depth of a blind wandering swordsman , often lonely but inevitably beloved by some beautiful young women , usually giving you a helpless , melancholy , nostalgic romantic broken dream . the original zatoishi movies were also having the integrity of solid screenplays , fantastic directing , wonderful settings , perfect supporting performance , amazing fighting scenes and sequences , seamlessly perfected editings ... .from the first two black and white ones to the other 24 colored ones , none of them was never seriously produced . and best of all , shintaro played the zatoishi role almost seamlessly perfect that oscar or any other kind of film festivals would suffice enough to honor him . i just do n't know and do n't see why and how this new addition would be necessary in any way . why suddenly the great zatoishi blind swordman became an overly ruthless , heartless , and cunning mobster , a stereotyped trademark of an vicious yakuza killer instead of guardian angel of the helpless common people ? so bloody and so pointlessly gory gross ? it 's a quite hollow and shallow one if compares to those originals . yes , the movie industry 's technique maybe more modern , but if we failed to deliver a better and newer version and interpretation of this great legend and character in japanese samurai genre , we better not , shall we say : you do n't need add crawling feet to a snake when trying to make a snake look more alive . it 's totally unnecessary
