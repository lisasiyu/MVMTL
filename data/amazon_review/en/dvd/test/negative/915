extremely disappointing i love eddie murphy , and i loved dr. doolittle ! the previews of dr. d ii looked so funny , i could n't wait to see it . well , i just saw it , and my mind has still not recovered . dr. doolittle 2 is one of the worst films i have ever seen . the story and dialouge are so mind-numbing , even the animated murphy and raven symone , who plays his teenage daughter , could n't salvage it . the story revolves around dr. doolittle trying to save the patch of forest behind his house from a land-hungry developer . to do this , doolittle must rehab a tame bear and make him wild , because this bear is an endangered species , and if he lives in the forest , the developer ca n't touch it . sounds kind of cute . . . it 's not . the bear acts and sounds like a washed up vegas lounge singer . his whiny voice ( steve zahn ) is so annoying that even i , a passionate animal lover , could not summon a shred of sympathy for this bear . and talk about long . this whole thin storyline is dragged out for ninety minutes until i writhed in pain . and the other animals ! a sad , alcoholic french monkey , a chamelon with a horrible mexican accent , and an abusive bear and his passive female bear . when the bear is not whining , a dog is narrating the whole film in another nasal , bland voice with horrible dialouge . a subplot involves his daughter rebelling and liking a boyfriend who is a complete idiot , is dropped off by a pizza delivery car and asks to stay two nights . murphy actually acquieses . what an intelligent , lovely girl like raven would see in this sorry homie is completely unbelievable . it is hard to believe people ( and animals ) are going hungry when millions were wasted on this fart of a film . it seemed like the voice actors were embarrased to be saying such stupid dialouge , and that the animal actors were embarrased to be acting such stupid roles - and i do n't blame them
