do n't waste your money this workout ( or should i call it that ) is composed of pieces of all different workouts put together . there is no class , no instructor , forget about cueing , no rhythm - it 's horrible . the abs part is even worse . a kindergartener can do it . 5 day abs ? yeah right . i 'm an advanced exerciser and this workout is a nightmare . trust me - do not waste your money
