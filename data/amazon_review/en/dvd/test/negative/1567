does n't even deserve 1 star the only resemblance rise to power has with the original carlito 's way film is in name and producer martin bregman . the success of the original begs for a vivacious , guns-blazing carlito brigante prequel . unfortunately , martin bregman decided to bankroll his son as the director . the result was a train wreck of a movie with horrible casting , acting , writing , directing ; you name it , michael bregman did it ... bad . topping it all off , the plot fails to lead in to the original movie ! the irony of this michael bregman is the similarity between him and a character in the movie - reggie . given the chance to inherit his older brother 's powerful and profitable position , reggie , at every turn , makes horrible decisions . at times , these decisions are made , seemingly without any sort of reason . in the same way , michael bregman 's choices for the film are painfully disgraceful to the original carlito 's way , and to his father ... this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . for the love , stay away..
