the `` plan 9 from outer space '' of art-house films unintentionally hilarious ; so pretentious and poorly made that i was strangling with laughter several times . jesus/god/satan has sex with every member of a cartoonish bourgeois family and ruins their lives in various side-splitting ways . the maid becomes a saint who eats nettle soup , cures scarred children , and floats in the air . the wife bites the side of her finger , has sex with random strangers , and screams with all the authenticity of a teen in a slasher flick as mozart 's requiem thunders in the background . the movie is technically inept and badly written . any randomly chosen film of bunuel or almodovar will have more to say about sexual politics than this pasolini fiasco . recommended only for connoisseurs of the atrocious . two stars for the `` so bad it 's good '' factor .
