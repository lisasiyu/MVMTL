fake `` dog whisperer '' - studious ignorance cesar milan , the so-called 'dog whisperer ' , bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age . he teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status , and that you need to use painful 'corrections ' to convince them that you are alpha . this idea has n't the slightest shred of evidence going for it . yes , dogs do have dominance roles , but that has n't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors . dogs do 'bad ' doggy behaviors because they work . dog guards his food bowl ? dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away . dog pulls on the leash ? dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up . the dog does n't care whether or not you 're alpha ; he only cares that what he 's doing works to get him what he wants . technically , cesar 's methods work . but they use force , fear , and pain to teach the dog , when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques . i have three hyper , active , highly driven border collies , and they 're all very obedient and mannerly . they do n't haul me around the leash , nor do they leap at guests , nor do they ignore me when i tell them something . and i do n't need to be 'alpha ' to get them that way ; neither does anyone else . i strongly suggest that you do n't buy this item . good books to start with are karen pryor 's 'getting started : clicker training for dogs ' , melissa alexander 's 'click for joy ! ' ( also with a great problem solving section ) , and jean donaldson 's 'the culture clash ' . you can easily have a happy , obedient , well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain
