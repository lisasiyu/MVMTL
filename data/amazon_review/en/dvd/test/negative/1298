man hating hollywood . the plot is of this film is built around hal , jack black 's character , being a `` shallow '' beauty obsessed man who one day finds that he is no longer capable of noticing a woman 's exterior appearance . thanks to tony robbins and his neuro-linguistic programming , hal can only see a woman 's internal beauty . is there any legitimacy to such a premise in the first place ? of course not . it 's totally ridiculous . one reason is that obesity correlates with mental disorders like depression and obsession-compulsion . the real question is why are these individuals incapable of controlling their own behavior ? it certainly is n't due to their being more picturesque `` inside '' than the rest of us . more importantly , hal 's true self is far deeper rather than the robbinized one ; we see the hypnotized hal pleasing obese women everywhere while he actively working against his own interests and those of humanity . when he was categorizing women based on their physical fitness and beauty he was practicing a form of selection that allowed us to be among the most successful species on earth . his choice gave him excellent odds of mating with a women who happened to be fertile and also strong enough to survive pregnancy . contrast this with what happened after he was placed under the conjurer 's spell as his reproductive chances immediately evaporated . a porcine woman is one less likely to be fecund , and also one more likely to contract diabetes , hypertension , preeclampsia , and ovarian cancer along with producing babies who are afflicted with omphalocele and various other birth defects . there 's nothing shallow about avoiding obese women . the fact is it 's the height of intelligence . such a predisposition is highly refined and highly recommended . that we have evolved to the point of castigating men who desire healthy mates is merely another indicator of society-wide misandry and our reflexive habit of condemning what is male while fawning over what is female .
