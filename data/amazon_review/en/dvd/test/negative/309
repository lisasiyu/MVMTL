10.5 on the unrealistic scale one of the supporting actresses said it best in this movie , `` forget what you saw on tv . '' the entire disaster is based on , well , make-believe . and to top it off , it appears the only person in the entire country who figured out what is going on has written scientific books that nobody else believes . everybody else are idiots and have absolutely no idea what to do . in fact , the head of fema , who has been placed in charge of overseeing the problems , ca n't seem to come up with more than one plan . he draws a complete blank when asked for a contingency plan . and then there is the entire nuclear warhead thing is just laughable and a complete ripoff of armagedon . the only thing missing was bruce willis . the only thing that was promised and delivered was the special effects . it actually was n't all that bad for a made-for-tv movie . unfortunately , that is the only good thing i can come up wtih . the acting was silly , the dialogue was horrocious , the length was way too long , and the reality was n't existent . all in all , i would not recommend this unless you are really into disaster flicks ( which my wife is and why i ended up watching it myself ) .
