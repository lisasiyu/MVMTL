the novel would be better harold ramis 's `` the ice harvest '' wallows in mid-market crime and holiday angst , but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires . all the ingredients are there , but ultimately the movie lacks spice . in some movies , it works where all the characters move at a slow pace - `` nobody 's fool , '' for example . but a dark comedy needs some pep , and `` the ice harvest '' does n't have it . a lot of that blame falls on the shoulders of john cusack , one of my favorite actors . he is at his best when he is riffing one of his intelligent-yet-soulful monologues , like in `` high fidelity '' and `` say anything . '' here , cusack 's job is to look morose and make the occasional comment - he may speak the fewest lines in any film he 's made as a leading man , and that 's a shame . billy bob thornton tries to liven up the movie in his scenes , but the menacing actor is off-screen for huge swaths of time and his absence is felt . the same with the entertaining oliver platt , who plays a drunken buffoon as well as anyone - he 's enjoyable on-screen , but when he 's not there , we miss him . the bar is set pretty high for holiday-as-setting-for-dysfunction movies . none of the exchanges rise to the visceral heights of the husband-wife spat of `` the ref , '' for example . the movie is filled with small-time hoods who all seem hung-over or depressed rather than moved to exercise their savage wits . instead , we get an ominous film that in many ways tries to evoke `` fargo '' or `` a simple plan , '' but does n't get anywhere close . there are a few laugh-out-loud moments that i wo n't spoil that keep the movie from being a complete waste of time . but all in all , the movie is a downer , and when the winners are finally revealed at the end , it feels less like a triumph than it does a ho-hum conclusion . throughout the movie , i kept wondering if this would have been a much more enjoyable movie where we got to see what was actually going on inside the minds of the characters . . . there seemed to be many scenes where the actors kept the best lines to themselves . petty crime can be highly enjoyable , but not in `` the ice harvest .
