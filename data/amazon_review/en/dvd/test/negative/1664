a misfire from the 60s although bold for its time , this film is nothing more than a rather unimaginative 1964 politically charged western . apart from the novel idea of using the generic gung-ho western style of the day to advance a civil rights theme , this film is simply plagued with an unimaginative screenplay , poor direction , a script full of cliches , and terrible acting . a small town of yankees is angered by the return of former confederate matt weaver ( george segal ) and decides to hire a gunman . jules gaspard d'estaing ( brynner ) , a creole from louisianna , is hired to do the job but he is soon found to be a man of conscience and principle . it so happens that the yankees are the biggots and the southerner the victim with the colored man as the conscience of the film . a predictable love affair also springs up in a vain attempt to relieve the audience from its boredom . this is simply a terrible film with cliched dialogues and situations juxtaposed solely to make a blunt political statement as to diversity , equality , and justice . yul brynner is the only good actor in this film and even his performance suffers as a result of this simply atrocious production . this film has n't aged well and its subtle attempts at addressing the prevalent social issues of its day are as novel and moving as a sidney poitier film . this film is just too antiquated and poorly conceived to be worth owning or even watching .
