poor history and a screenplay over-dramatic i 'm glad someone knows enough about english history to recognize the pure fiction of this film . but in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy , i also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of mary tudor . over-zealous and fanatic ( as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the protestant/catholic conflict ) , she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes . and throughout the film , there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever . i was sorely disappointed ! if you want to get to know elizabeth and the period in which she lived , i would recommend the superb bbc series , elizabeth r with glenda jackson . and if you want even further background , look to the bbc again in the six wives of henry viii with keith mitchell . tidbits can be gained as well from the movie mary , queen of scots ( although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example , mary stuart and elizabeth never met , although it was mary 's great desire ) and even another title , anne of the thousand days . those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times . this film just does n't cut it
