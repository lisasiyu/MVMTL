does n't live up to the hype after seeing a preview in a theatre of this re-release , i was intrigued , mainly because it did n't have any of the usual '70s black action stars ( fred williamson , richard roundtree , et al ) in it . i though maybe this was the great lost blaxploitation film . i was wrong . it 's just not that great . it 's got a good plot and good intentions , but a mediocre script , some remarkably gratuitous scenes of violence and nudity ( even for this genre ) and atrocious acting by everybody except the two leads ( who struggle valiantly but in vain ) keep this on the level of a cheap made-for-tv movie . sorry , folks , it just does n't live up to the hype
