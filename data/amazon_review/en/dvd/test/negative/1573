more of the same ... rest stop is a pretty bad straight to dvd horror flick . it 's the same old `` redneck rampage '' style serial killer flick . but the plot is just in shambles and does n't make much sense . only about 20 minutes of this movie is worth seeing . by the way , you know a movie is bad when joey lawrence is the best actor in it . i 'll give it this much ... there are probably two very nasty/awesome gore scenes for the slasher fans out there
