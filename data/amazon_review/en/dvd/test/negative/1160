save your money i bought this dvd based on the excellent reviews . as both an afficionado , and practitioner of kink , i am always looking for a good film in that genre . not only is `` maitresse '' poorly acted but the story line is completely unbelievable . i also found the film `` quality '' leaving a lot to be desired . ( poor lighting ) i found myself falling asleep about a third of the way through and just could not get into it . the relationship and communication between the domme and her clients was cold and unfeeling , and left me with the impression that i had just watched two robots doing physical things with each other . there was just no chemistry between the players . save your money
