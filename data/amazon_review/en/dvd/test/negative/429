really pretty dull for such a button-pushing topic i was n't impressed by this film . first of all , i could never `` buy '' that saskia reeves and clive owen were a brother and sister . nothing in their mannerisms or physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related . nor does the backstory provided by the film give any credibility to their supposed brother-sister relationship . they might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character problems , because that 's how the relationship came across . personally , outside of the button-pushing topic of incest , i found this movie dull and sometimes tawdry . clive owen looked and acted like a low-grade truculent lawrence harvey , and saskia reeves was simply annoying ( like her character , a weak , hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man . ) the only actors who showed any real feeling were alan rickman as the husband , and karl johnson as clive owen 's aids-stricken boss . karl johnson has the best scene in the film : he goes to a meeting with sores around his mouth and in a wheelchair , obviously suffering from aids , and this very fact intimidates the guy he 's gone to meet . the man keeps trying to subtly jerk his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the karl johnson character , and in the end karl johnson seizes the guy 's sandwich and bites it , then offers the other guy a bite , pushing the sandwich into his face , basically ... it 's a scene that crackles with his anger & pain at being trapped by this illness , which is going to kill him , while this corrupt and self-important man is able to function normally . but aside from that wake-up call , the film dragged , and by the time clive owen 's character was shouting in the climatic scene his realization that he 's been used by his `` sister '' to inflate her sense of self-importance , i was long gone , with my head nodding . much ado about nothing , frankly . one star for the soundtrack ; one star for the performances of alan rickman ( what little he has to work with , he shines ) and karl johnson . die-hard clive owen fans such as myself ; eeeh , pass on this .
