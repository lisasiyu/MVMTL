this is not alexander since we really do n't have much to go on as far as factual historical accounts of alexander , we can only surmise our image of him from what little there is written about him . we know a lot about what he accomplished because the results are evident , but trying to put together a portrait of his `` true '' character and nature is at best just hypothetcal conjecture . no one knows who alexander really was as a person . most people do n't even know themselves . does this movie convey alexander as he really was or just some hollywood director 's personal idea that has been gleaned from rehashed biograpies of alexander . from the ridiculous harold lamb version to the account of arrian to the more scholarly robin lane fox 's `` alexander the great '' there is n't much that can be added to what scant information we have . certainly the life of alexander is a msystery since there is virtualy nothing know about it , and what little is know was n't even included in the film . for example , his leading the cavalry charge at the `` battle of chaeronea '' which resulted in philip 's hegemony of greece was n't ever mentioned in the movie . instead , sensual garbage including his mother 's fetish with snakes and her completely embellished influence on him , in the usual hollywood manner , is the kind of rubbish that is fostered upon the viewer . obviously , his mother had and influence on him as all mothers have an influence on their children , but `` give me a break '' . this kind of theatrical emoting is a waste of screen time which should have been spent on showing us what alexander did in his life , which is what made him `` the great '' . almost all of the significant things he did are not even mentioned or so quickly glossed over that they are meaningless . and a lot of what is mentioned is n't even correct . and many of the conclusions made by the director are purely guesswork , and bad guess work at that . another example of something significant left out of the movie in favor of snake slithering : at the age 16 alexander was intrusted with the regency of macedonia while philip was sieging perinthos and byzantium in eastern thrace . while his father was gone , the maedi , a thracian tribe , revolted . alexander led a campaign against them , succeeded , and established a new colony at maedi and named it alexandros . he was also allowed to refered to as a `` man '' after that , because he had killed an enemy in hand-to-hand combat , and that was the only way a macadonian could be considered a `` man '' . at that time alexander was able to start having an insight and true understanding of his father which could have only been attained from the battle field . it was possible to comprehend his father 's harsh , disciplined life which included drinking , hunting , and loving . the rest of alexander 's life was just as remarkable as his exploit in suppressing the uprising at maedi , but the movie , in my opinion , just does n't do justice to alexander . a man who did what he did and in such a short time deserves better . and quite frankly , except for the poorly done battle scenes , i 've seen more action in `` road runner '' cartoons . one final example which was n't even hinted at in the movie : on his march back `` home '' , he encountered the `` mallians '' , a fierce and warring nation . an assault was made on their major stronghold , and the men with the scaling ladders were late arriving . alexander , with his impatience to storm the fortress , grabbed a ladder from the first ladder bearer to arrive and personally placed it against the wall and climbed up . three othr men followed him up the ladder and made the top with him . the men on the ground scrambled to follow alexander , and their combined weight broke the ladder , and the king and the three soldiers were stranded on top of the battlements . the men on the ground pleaded for him to jump back down into their arms and safety , but alexander jumped into the fort and attacked . he received a serious chest wound but not before dispatching several of the mallians . the army broke into the stronghold , and thinking alexander dead , killed everyone there . that 's the kind of man that this movie should have been telling the story of , not some jickjack jollie snake juggling mishmash of psyhological meanderings that were a complete bore . alexander was a man of action , a great leader and general , a genius of military stratagey and tactics , a philosopher , muscian , had schooling in botany , astronomy , medicine , geography , and other various disciplines and he was a hero in the `` grand tradition '' . maybe peter jackson should make a movie about alexander . i 'm sure he could get it `` right '' .
