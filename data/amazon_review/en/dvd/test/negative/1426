read on ... .. you know a film is bad when you ca n't even finish watching it . 1 . russians do n't fly f-16s or northrop tigersharks 2 . used airial combat scenes from top gun , navy seals and iron eagle . 3 . used ground explosions from iron eagle 4 . specop forces do n't manuever around like they are playing on a paintball range . 5 . editing was horrid ( airial cut scenes from films that take place in the middle eastern desert then jumps to what look like pennsylvania woods ) 6 . acting was so bad i started to chuckle at the cheesey lines and delivery . 7 . plot would be better suited for a computer game . 8 . captain of the 'uss oakla ' ( no such ships exists ) has a hat with ssn depicting his carrier 's class ; well ssn means the hull classification symbol used by the united states navy for an attack submarine that is propelled by nuclear energy , such as the los angeles-class of attack submarines . this was as far as i got , about 50 minutes into the film . i 'm no critic and can enjoy a film for what it is but this was the most slapped together garbage i have ever seen
