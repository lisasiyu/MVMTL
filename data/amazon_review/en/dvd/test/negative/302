returned it to the store ! ! this video/dvd lacks the content it claims it has . it only covers 5 or so letters , and does not focus on the sounds . it is pain-stakingly boring , lacks excitement and did not keep my 20 month old daughter 's attention . even the bonus section that is supposed to teach the letters on the dvd version did not appeal to her . needless to say , we returned this one to the store . i recommend leapster 's letter factory which has taught my daughter the sounds of the letters within 2 weeks and has a bonus interactive letter game
