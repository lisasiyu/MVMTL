waste of time i got this film because i 'm from detroit where this takes place . it 's a pretty typical revenge flick . four brothers want to find their adoptive mother 's killer . usual smartass remarks , guys talking bs , fights , shootouts , blah , blah , blah . i guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch . this script was mediocre at best . give me a clint eastwood or bruce willis film any day over this tripe .
