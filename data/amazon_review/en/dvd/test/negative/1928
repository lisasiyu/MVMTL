insulting for people of faith , in my opinion first , i did not rate this poorly by comparing it to the original . i looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake . also , unlike many reviewers , i had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back . the majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back . american culture and freedom is not the historical norm . that said , i was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie , nor the quality of the acting , though the special effects were pretty good , imho . the theme , however , that struck me as most rememorable in this movie , and caused me to drop an otherwise 3 to a 1 ( or less ) , is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away . as our `` hero '' encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world ( forgive my not remembering their names ) , it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for , even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down . then there 's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion , yet the moment he enters the spaceship , he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that . i could n't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience , `` hey , have n't you heard of that guy darwin ? yeah ? then why do you still believe in that silly god person of yours ? '' this movie , i believe did try to touch an issue of the day , secularism verus religion . the movie , it seems , coming down heavily on the side of secularism
