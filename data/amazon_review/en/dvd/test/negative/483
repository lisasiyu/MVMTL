the novelty 's worn off , and it 's left as a former shell of itself on tuesday november 30 , 1982 i had just come home from a scout meeting , and i turned on the television , and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper , and told me to turn it off , and i did n't even know the name of this . i looked it up in the tv guide later on , and unfortunately , due to the fact that i was still shaken up by the other night i did n't dare share the name due to the fact i 'd get a sermon . i was at a crucial age in my life where i was 15 where i had desires for girls , but emotionally i was not prepared for them . i can understand the fact that it 's a morally bankrupt film , and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution , but i do n't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world 's been turning , but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that . i guess looking back my parents argument is `` there 's a time and place for everything '' , but guess what that would 've been a perfect time to help me understand . i know that a few months later that i brought it up to my aunt who 's a committed christian , and she paled , which led up to the sermon , and to be honest i felt like i could n't win . i feel with this movie i had to not let it go until i got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it 's entirety , and i did n't get to see this until i was 20 , and i brought it back up to my parents as my father 's friend had just opened a video store in cherry hill , nj. , and the battle started again . i have felt like a eunich i did n't get to watch this movie all this time , and when i did i found it rather appealling , and now wanted to add it to my collection i was getting flack as i actually bought the blank video , and tried to get it copied onto the videotape . looking back i would 've been better off just buying it , but i know i have to wonder if i would 've come to same conclusion . i got the tape finally when i was 25 years old , and watched it once , and since then i lost the appeal . i saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from . i did n't focus on the colors , or the scene where ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by elaine , and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that mrs. robinson took away ben 's virginity , and this was when ben was trying to get together with elaine . i found this to be coincidental , but rather truthful when i had a woman make a phone call one night when i was working in a convience store , and it was a rather seductive one , and then the woman just turned it off when i finally met her kind of like mrs. robinson doing it to ben , and especially when he was in too deep . the fact that this happened could 've been an alternative lesson my father could 've taught me if he did n't want to talk about the sexual nature . with this mindset i do n't own this anymore , and have no inclination , or intention of owning it again . i ca n't honestly say if i bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would 've made a difference . i feel that once i saw the fact that mrs. robinson made a blank promise to make ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me . this is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would 've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to , or it 's implied that it 's a man 's job to have an affair , but that 's the world 's standard , and morally it 's wrong for either side to cheat on one another . it left me feeling that i was n't worth the time to talk about this movie to , and about the way the relationships in the movie , and made to feel dirty because i wanted to know , and angry that i had to repress myself , and my feelings , and my character to fit this model that pleased my family . i just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it , and not worry about your parents helping you . mind you it is a pg rating , so anyone 13 and under not without a parent .
