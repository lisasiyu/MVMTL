dont be deceived i thought this would be a fun . light evening - something to take my mind off my troubles - i am on ublic assistance so it is very hard to scrape together the money to rent a movie - i had free passes from chirstmas so i go this with those . i remeber loviing to dance when i was a litle girl - i tapped and did some jazz dancing - nothing like these ladies - who do almost nude dancing in this `` family '' film . this story was about emotional abuse - women suffering becasue some man has treated them like garbage . i was abused my whole liffe until one day i took a walk to a store ( my husband had hidden the keys from me - i looked for them but at the time i was drugging - hooked on meth ) and found a book on emotional abuse that changed my life . they shoudl remake this movie and the women should get revenge on the men for all the abuse . no one will ever hurt me again
