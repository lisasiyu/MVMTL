disappointed- i bought this video for my 2 1/2 year old because he is very interested in the alphabet . the dvd was a huge disappointment because it did n't deal with letters but focused on rhyming words , etc . not suitable for my son 's age , boring and short . they sing a 60 second song with the alphabet that is an extra feature and that was the only thing he liked . not a good buy
