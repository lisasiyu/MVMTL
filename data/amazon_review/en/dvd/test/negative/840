reincarnation i 'd seen shimizu 's `` the grudge '' and so my expectations were pretty high on this supernatural horror film . it 's nowhere near the scariness or originality of the grudge but that bein said , it 's not too horrible as far as japanese horror flicks goes these days . the trailer was actually a lot scarier than the actual movie . the special fx are probably better than other stuff i 've seen recently in b-type movies . bottom line , i was expecting much more out of this
