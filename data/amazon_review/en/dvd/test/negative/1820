more torturous sports from todd solondz in `` palindromes '' solondz has found another novel way to tell us how miserable and futile life can be . he 's great at pinpointing where it hurts , but i think i 'm ready to call the doctor . there 's a scene in preston sturges ' `` the lady eve '' where henry fonda and barbara stanwyck are on the deck of a cruise ship , and henry fonda is staring out over the water saying something like , `` i feel like i 've known you all my life . i keep meeting you , etc . '' `` palindromes '' stretches that idea over 110 minutes , using a young girl who desperately wants to get pregnant portrayed by eight different actresses . when she 's finally successful , you 'll be mumbling to yourself , `` this is so wrong . this is so wrong . '' solondz reportedly wanted heather matarazzo to reprise her role as dawn weiner from `` welcome to the dollhouse '' for this film ; when she declined solondz had her character commit suicide .
