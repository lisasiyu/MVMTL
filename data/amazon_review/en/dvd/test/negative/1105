bad one for charlie charles bronson is one of my favorites , but violent city is example of 70 's trash at it 's worst . boring slow pacing and a `` see-saw '' action that gets old really fast . bronson 's character is so stupid acting in this film for a hitman that you wish he would get killed off himself . i love charles bronson ... but this is one of his dud films
