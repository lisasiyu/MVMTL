kind of loses steam very quickly even though it 's used by a lot of reviewers , i have to use it too . the opening scene has john travolta staring into the camera delivering a monologue about how hollywood creates **** lately . he mentions that it would be great if the bad guy got away in the end , then later in the film he talks about harry houdini and misdirection . oddly , this film was produced by joel silver , who i can list as a creator , or at least a deliverer , of said hollywood **** . there 's only 3 reasons really to watch this film , none of which have anything to do with the story , which shows you just how the film is . stan is a talented hacker who 's been down on his luck since being released from jail . dead end job , unkempt trailer and denied rights to see his daughter . well , an opportunity comes when a woman , ginger , offers him money to meet with a man . that man , gabriel , is incredibly wealthy and will pay him 10 million dollars to create a computer virus that 'll net him near 10 billion dollars . of course , it does n't help that the feds are after both of them those 3 reasons ? well , the first is an incredibly awesome looking shot where we get a 180 slow motion pan ( it is not a full 360 ) after an explosion goes off and we see it 's aftermath . while the full version of the x-men last stand shot found in the special features looks better , this is just as great . the other is at the end where a helicopter flies a bus all over the city and smacking into buildings while the 3rd is of course a nude sunbathing halle berry which apparently she was paid a handsome sum of money for each breast shown . however , that 's kind of where the good parts end . the biggest problem is that it 's an action movie based on the lowest common denominator . it 's super-stylized and sleek and has some pretty big sequences but that 's it . some action films like die hard inexplicably hold up on repeated viewings . here , after the first watch , you 've probably experienced all you 're going to see . they add in the daughter subplot which is n't as developed as it should be but it did resonate with me . the film does have its fan but it 's hard for me to like something so ... .plastic . should you buy it ? i doubt it , unless you want a show-off disc for your home theatre , something that other films do infinitely better
