bad movie but dvd is improved this batman movie is one of the worst batman movies . although the movie suffers from a super silly feel , i still think it might be better than the melodramatic batman begins . val kilmar is the worst batman ever . not bad special effects in this 90 's movie . the batman franchise died with this movie . the only two good batman movies are batman and batman returns . although this movie stinks , it has good special features . music videos , making of docs , interviews , dleted scenes : it has all the works . i would pick it up only if you are a huge batman fan and want to add it to your collection but otherwise i would just save my money
