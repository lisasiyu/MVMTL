jason robards at his worst . one of the curiosities of shakespeare 's `` julius caesar '' is that the main character is not `` julius caesar '' , who is killed early in the play , nor marc antony , who has by far the best and most famous speech - `` friends , romans , countrymen , ... '' . the central character is brutus , the `` noblest roman of them all '' , who must balance his his duty toward rome against his loyalty to caesar . brutus is a follower of the stoic philosophy and so tries to achieve virtue by using his reason to choose and follow noble goals , rather than being lead by his emotions . it seems that the director of this movie seeks to convey this idea by having jason robards , a highly skilled actor , deliver all brutus 's lines in a bored flat undertone . i wonder how they persuaded him to do it ? `` do n't act jason . trust us . just read the lines off slowly like you never saw them before and you do n't care a pin . it 'll be great. ! '' to say this completely spoils the movie is an understatement . mr. spock has a wider emotional range . they would have done better and saved money by having brutus played by a flashing blue light and the guy who did the voice of the hal 9000 . when brutus is off screen the movie is fine . heston is surprisingly good . gielgud is great . it is sort of a pity that the movie is in color because it makes it harder to ignore the poor costumes , the cheap sets , the worst fake beard in the history of cinema . if you want to see a much better film version , there is the classic black and white version in whcih james mason and sir john gielgud make a superb pair as brutus and casius , and marlon brando gives a chilling antony . as for this one , if someone gives it to you as a present , by all means look at it first before you donate it to the public library
