overrated i did n't think chicken run was that great . yes , i 'm aware of the big numbers the movie drew on opening weekend at the movie theaters , and i 'm aware of its overwhelming popularity , but the movie did n't do a whole lot for me . i think the main problem is that the chickens have an english accent , making it hard to understand them . the film was also very dark and hard to see what was happening ( no , it was n't my television ) . the claymation is nice , but that 's the only thing the movie had going for it
