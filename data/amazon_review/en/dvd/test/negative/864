the book is better . this film is based on one of my favourite books , so i was really looking forward to seeing it . despite great performances by blanchett and fienes , it just does n't hold together well . too much of what is in the book has been left out and that which is there lacks weight . the characters in the book are so much more complex and endearing . the book was very moving and engaging while the movie is not . there is also an ending tacked on that does n't exist in the book , and that always annoys me . i was very disappointed . i think had i not read the book , i 'd have stopped watching the movie about 1/3 into it
