disappointing . wasted potential . i love indy films and try to support them whenever i can . i heard about this film after it showed at an indy fest in new york . the reviews i read were good , so when it was released on dvd i bought it . now , i am selling it . this film was very disappointing as it raised provocative issues , but basically glossed over them . the racial issues in the restaurant were n't thoroughly explored . also , the character development of the workers was lacking . interesting characters were introduced but never fully developed . the director and writer seemed to be going for the sappy , pc slant and that ruined what could have been a thought provoking , honest view of the complexity of racial issues in modern society . another thing worth noting is that several scenes and lines of dialogue were edited out [ deleted ] from the dvd version of this film . the extras include deleted scenes but not the specific scenes of which i am speaking . one of the main reasons i purchased the dvd was because of the scene between chris [ brody ] and leslie [ hill ] , but several lines of that scene were deleted . the director 's commentary even states that they wanted to make the theme more human and less black and white or racial . it is obvious that this was their intent and it ruined the film . the final scene is just plain lame . the director stated that ending a film is the hardest thing to do and he proved it ! there were some scenes/lines , but too few to recommend this film
