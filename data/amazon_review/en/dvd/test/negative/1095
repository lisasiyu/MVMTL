not really bad but could 've been a lot better the series ' main flaw is the repetetiveness of the storylines , somehow even though i watched the episodes back-to-back i still felt deja-vu . the plot would n't advance for episodes , and i think this is what caused the ratings to plummet , they took too long to flesh out the plot so , the fans grew bored . also , what contributed to my feelings was the showing of several identical slides in every episode ! that said , it still was a fun watch , the bonds shared by the twins , chobi , lisa , and the enigmatic kaze are really interesting and often funny ( when not pertaining to kaze of course ) . also , the villians were not malevoloent , just mischevious which only served to affirm my opinion that this anime is more oriented towards kids . i 'm not sure about the mechanism used to rate if it 's final fantasy or not , but i think the fact that they had crammed all the plot twists in the last episode contributed to the criticisms , i think if the animators took some of the sub-plots out and focused on the storyline this series would 've been good , instead of just decent . as it is , it 's still fun , and at a bargain price ; if you have nothing better to do , go ahead and watch it !
