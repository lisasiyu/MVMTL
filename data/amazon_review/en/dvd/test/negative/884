good pictures , very bad story . for me , as an old superman reader , i found the movie story very hard to `` believe '' . the picture shooting and the special effect of it is master piece , wish richard donner has this same techonolgy in 1978 . why the story is so weak ? first , it is not logical for superman to leave earth suddenly without telling anybody specially lois ( and specially if their relation went to making love this time ) . second , the reason of this disappearing , and what a reason , he knew from sciencetes that his planet , krypton , might no be explode and there are some survivors , well , superman does n't need earth people to tell him about his planet , he could use his telescopic vision to check that and not to go there and check , under the red sun radiations . and if we presume that he went for this reason , why it took him 4 years to come back ? , ... ... . no answer . third , clark kent was absance too , for the same period like superman , is it normal for lois not to doubt in this matter , we all know she is the all time person who always think that clark kent is superman , but now she even does n't care of saying hello to him ? ? ? ? fourth , why he need space ship to come back to earth ? we all know that under the yellow sun , he gain all his power back . more and more , i ca n't believe when he can carrie a whole island of kryptonite all this distance from earth to space , while he usually ca n't breath if he was under the radiation of the green kryptonite . well , this story suits children who are new to superman . i think they should contact people like alan moore and cary bates next time if they want to make superman movie .
