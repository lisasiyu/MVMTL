ever seen a made at home movie ? nows your chance ! ... now how do you start a review of this kind of movie . was it a movie ? when all of a dozen towns people at the gate are waving farewell and sending the would be heros into battle against the ( wonderfully computer rendered ) dragons does n't that just somehow seem sad . we six heros will die so that the dragons wo n't eat the rest of you ! thats right all 11 of ... oh im sorry did n't see you there , all twelve of you . i especially like how in this town of twelve+heros there happens to be a traveling deadly martial arts guy , a beautiful girl with a huge crossbow on wheels , ( talk about envy ) and the robin hood guy , except he 's actually from outside the town . so i 'm going to stop now before i cry ... yes it was that bad . but as always watch it for the heck of it and try not to be upset about time lost in a vigilant attempt to make sense out of the dragon storm movie thing..experience thing
