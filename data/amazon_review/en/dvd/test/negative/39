one of andersons misses i have now seen several gerry anderson projects , many hits and some misses , this one is close to dead last for me ( wait , it is dead last ) . a priest driving a model t is the hero in this one . he also has a shrinking ray ( shrinks to like 1/3 normal ) that he uses on his assistant who is a groundskeeper/secret agent . sound interesting ? well , i got the set cheap so why not buy it ? if your an anderson fan as i am , it was worth the price , just do n't expect to show it to your friends as it 's really tame and slow plodding with model t car chases and not a whole lot of action . here is my ranking of the shows i like from gerry anderson so take that into account of your own tastes . # 1 ufo ( a live adult sci-fi show with some great character development ) , # 2 joe 90 ( the concept is great and the non continuous storylines work good here ) , # 3 captain scarlet ( i love the concept and a lot of the shows fit in with the current war on terror to me ) , # 4 thunderbirds ( had a corgi toy as a kid , it was the best show for kids on tv at the time ) , # 5 stingray ( for the time , it was a great action kids show ) , # 6 fireball xl5 ( like a stingray except in space and black and white ) , # 7 the protectors ( eh , it 's ok ) , # 8 space 1999 ( this is where my recommended shows stop , this show was so highly anticipated and quickly got really stupid even i could n't stay with it in the 70 's ) , # 9 terrahawks ( just started watching it now it may move up above space 1999 and the protectors ) , # 10 secret service . i have n't watched his other stuff and i know there is stuff out there like supercar but that would probably rank above secret service for me .
