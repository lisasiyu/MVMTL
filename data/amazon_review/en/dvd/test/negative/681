cheap switcheroo ... originally placed the order for the non-thinpak release as amazon had listings for both the original-style 5-discs box set and the `` new '' slimline thinpak . seems mgm decided not to release this box set in the original style ; annoying to say the least . they 've previously released seasons 1 through 8 in the old-style . sg-1 is now a cancelled series -- so what 's the harm with releasing the same style for the last two releases ( season 9 & 10 ) ? ? this is not unlike the simpson 's box sets which were changed in season 5 to `` head shots '' of simpsons characters . after much protest , their distributor came out with original box set-style releases . smaller package ... less inserts ... looks puny on the dvd rack next to the other eight seasons ... same price . got ta love that marketing plan ! i 'm returning mine and waiting on the hopes mgm will come to some sense and release the final two seasons old-school
