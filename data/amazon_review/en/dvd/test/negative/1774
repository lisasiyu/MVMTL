warning - this is not the baywatch we remember i 've purchased seasons one and two thus far . if this third set is as poorly done as the first two , stear clear . if you remember the old lps that stated `` all songs performed by original artists '' meant that the songs were rerecorded . the first 2 sets were poorly done . season one , from nbc has been named `` bonus '' selections . this is clearly a ploy to force a collector to purchase all seasons just to aquire the true first season . the music on the series is nothing short of annnoying . it simply is poor and detracts from our collective memory . the picture quality is poor and looks extremely worn and dated . i ca n't get over the music . it is really that bad . bad enough that this set should be rejected by consumers . one ca n't help but feel cheated when the waited for dvd set lacks the original audio ( replaced by truly awful songs ) , and the picture quality so poor
