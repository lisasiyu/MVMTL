could not get this to play i purchased this dvd , and could not get it to play in my dvd player . i sent it back for exchange , and received another identical disk that it too would not play . i sent it back for a refund , and was never able to view it . i never thought to try it in my computer , bur realize now that could have been the compatibility issue . oddly , the dvd has the symbol on it that it should work in any and all dvd players in the us..
