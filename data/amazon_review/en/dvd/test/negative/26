whip me til i 'm dead- a real bore i was expecting to see a decent film by bava , but after having seen about 5 of his films , i can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us . most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story , this film is just like all the rest . there is no point to any of it , there is no plot and hardly any suspense , suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult , its quite tedious . chris lee is rather banal also , he does n't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio , most of the cast is rather dull also , supposedly playing some ancient noble family , they look more like 1960 's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid . the dialogue , what there is , is crude , probably written by a drunk italian because there are so many mistakes , one example was when lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says , `` i ca n't have more ice cream ! '' so , i would suggest renting `` planet of the vampires '' because that is more enjoyable than this waste . interesting character to note was `` lesmo '' , dubbed as the `` european peter lorre '' who does n't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget .
