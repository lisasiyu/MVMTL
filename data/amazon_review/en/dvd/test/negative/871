disappointing ... this is baed on one of 4 novels that sir conan doyle wrote in his sherlock holmes series . since the book has a lot of details and a lot of exposition that can really go wrong in a feature film length movie , i had expected that a reasonable change & corresponding adaptation were made to translate this into a movie . alas ! the constant mediocre suspense throughout the movie added on by sherlock holmes ' very rude attitude toward miss . morstan were appalling . the book says that sherlock holmes said `` state your case '' in a brisk manner . `` brisk '' is nothing close to being rude in its meaning of the word . dr. watson in numerous accounts describes sherlock holmes as having a gentleness towards women . he may not express any fondness for women but was chivalrous nonetheless . granted the character of sherlock holmes is not an easy one to portray for any actors , and so far jeremy brett captures it the best . however , this one was surely disappointing . holmes ' keen nature and energy was well demonstrated but his good professional mannerism was surely lacking & compromised . i blame the script more than the actors really . this adapation just does n't capture the tone & flow of the original book . i highly recommend short story adaptations like adventures of sherlock holmes & the return of sherlock holmes series in granada series intead of any feature length installment . short story adaptations were much better than feature length ones
