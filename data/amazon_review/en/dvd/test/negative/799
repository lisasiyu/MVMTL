not as great as all the hype i hear all the time as i read hip hop mags and articles all about how great wild style is the best hip hop movie ever . well i purchased it at the first of the year and guess what it cant't hold beat street and breakin or krush grooves jockstrap . i think the movie rappin or even the not so get lorenzo lamas hip hop movie body rock has moments that's even better than wild style . people who read this will probably say what gives you the right to think you know so much well me being 30 years old you can do the math . thats around when the hip hop movement started . so if your a movie collector . go ahead and buy it but if you want a good movie to watch . then purchase somthing else .
