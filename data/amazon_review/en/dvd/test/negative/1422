lousy script with nothing but ... .. ? ? ? ? either drinking , cursing , and laughing in the pub , or replaying the messy home life style . what is this ? you call this 'one of the year 's top 10 movies ! ' , 'two thumbs up ! ' , 'one of the year 's funniest ! ' ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? this is one of the most terrible movies with bore-to-death storylines i 've ever seen . acting maybe acceptable but , with such a lousy script and a bunch of ugly young female actors , i have to pass . wasted my money was fine , but wasted 95 minutes watching this silly movie ? well , absolutely not ! rejected the dvd out of the player after about 15 minutes . thanks for nothing
