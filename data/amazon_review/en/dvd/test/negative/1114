[ poor ] and pretentious this film is about a female student at randolph university in alabama in the early 60 's who is a writer for the school newspaper . she gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement . it could have been a decent movie , but i found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing . a much , much better movie on this theme is the long walk home and also the ghosts of mississippi
