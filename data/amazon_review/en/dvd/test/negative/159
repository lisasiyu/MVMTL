incoherent , passionless , garbage . i watched this movie and i have no idea what it was about . admittedly it had the usual post-modern , post-matrix action movie tropes , improbably gorgeous protagonists dressed in tight clothing doing impossible things ( i 'm a big fan of charlize theron in a sheer body suit ) , lots of explosions , a vast , behind the scenes conspiracy ( well , that 's kind of redundant , most conspiracies are 'behind the scenes ) run by evil bad guys and futuristic storm troopers who are so bad with their firearms that they make the imperial storm troopers in star wars look like marine snipers , but other than that what was this movie about ? it 's as if the producers decided to take a bunch of these tropes , throw them up against the wall , see what stuck and how they splattered and then make a movie from the messy results . what comes out is incoherent and impossible to understand . `` aeon flux '' is `` plan 9 from outer space '' with better looking actors and a huge production budget . well no , it 's not even that , say what you will about ed wood , he at least liked the movies he made and threw himself into them , but it 's doubtful that anyone involved in `` aeon flux '' viewed this incoherent mess as anything other than a paycheck , and it shows . save your money , in a few years this will be on showtime late at night as a replacement for `` beastmaster iii '' and if you 're up late you can watch it then
