defective dvd ? i 'm a fairly dedicated blur fan , so it seemed that i 'd enjoy this dvd . the only problem was the sound ... which was mostly distorted and sounded like it was `` static-y '' , for lack of a better term . after watching it a few times , i went to the fan site www.blur.co.uk and in the forums found that many others had experienced the same problem . apparently `` starshaped '' was originally realeased on vhs when this footage was first captured in the early 90 's and the vhs version has much better sound , confirming that the sound is n't just `` raw '' , as it is live concert footage . one theory is that the sound was not correctly `` mastered '' when this dvd was produced , hence it is likely a problem on all copies of this dvd . i do have to say that the us version of the video for `` there 's no other way '' was good ( it 's a hidden easter egg - click on the star in the top level menu ) . but i could n't justify spending $ 13-14 for just one music video . i have returned the dvd for a refund
