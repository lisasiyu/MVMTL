`` i do n't want your love unless you know i am repulsive . '' you 'd have to go a long way to find a group of people as unpleasant as those depicted in christophe honore 's film `` ma mere . '' when the film begins , pierre ( louis garrel ) arrives from boarding school in france to spend the summer with his wealthy parents in gran canaria . his father ( philippe duclos ) rattles off some sort of heart-to-heart talk with his son about not really being the sort of person he 's become , but pierre is clearly bored and spoilt , and asks , `` can i go now ? '' pierre 's father returns to france and is abruptly killed in an accident . this leaves pierre alone with his mother , helene ( isabelle huppert ) and their two long-suffering servants . there 's no period of mourning -- although pierre does discover -- and foul -- his dad 's secret stash of naughty magazines , but then the film settles in to its main theme -- the tortured oedipal relationship that exists between pierre and helene . with pierre 's father gone , helene is clearly unleashed , and together with pierre , this mother-and-son team begins the odyssey of pierre 's total and complete debauchment . apparently this is n't difficult to achieve in a city full of holidaymakers and swingers who bravely sport outfits consisting of jockstraps and sequins . plus helene spares no time in introducing her son to her friend , rea ( joana preiss ) -- who is , apparently , `` the wildest woman '' in helene 's wild acquaintance . helene acts sometimes as a voyeur to her son 's debasement , and sometimes as a participant . and it 's all rather no-holds barred , revolting stuff . isabelle huppert is known for accepting risky roles -- consider `` the piano teacher '' for example -- a marvelous film that stretched boundaries . `` ma mere '' does more than stretch boundaries -- it 's an over-the-top kinkfest that sinks rapidly into scene after scene of revolting , purposeless and demeaning encounters . the only joy to be had here is the silly self-righteousness one occasionally indulges in from watching the antics of the filthy rich who have nothing to do all day but engage in depraved activities . huppert , as always , acts her heart out , but after a while , the film just becomes an exercise in how much the viewer will tolerate . in french with english subtitles -- displacedhuma
