making love scene completely cut i saw this movie in the theater some almost 30 years ago with my then partner and i definately remember the love making scene being hot and heavy though heavily shadowed in darkness . but the scene is completely gone in the dvd , as well as the kiss . now why in the world would they cut that out ! ! ! ? ? ? that was the whole point of going to see the movie at that time , it was on the cutting edge . one star because you screwed with the whole point of the movie `` making love ''
