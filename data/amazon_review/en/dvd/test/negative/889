sam has done much better please all this is far from sam elliot 's better westerns . see `` the sacketts ' , `` conagher '' , `` the shadow riders '' , or `` the quick and the dead '' . this is far less a believable western . few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern , not authentic . sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie . not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters i would want to see developed
