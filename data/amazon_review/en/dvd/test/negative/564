this star does not shine so-so story about a man 's relationship with a less than pleasant child star and said child star 's mother . like that old dickie roberts movie , it tries to say something about the plight of former and soon to be former child stars , but does not do a good job of it . mickey rooney and shirley temple , where are you when we need you ?
