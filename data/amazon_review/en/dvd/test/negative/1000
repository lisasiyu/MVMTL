lack of blonde ambition ! i only gave this movie 2 stars because of its 2 stars : mamie van doren and jayne mansfield . without the presence of these 2 bombshells , the film is a complete bomb . as a piece of film history , it has its place . as entertainment , it 's atrocious , even for the time . still , as i 've said , it does have mamie & jayne ! the male actors are laughable and the plot virtually non-existent , although you can say that about a lot of modern films too . only get this film if you 're passionate about its 2 lusty blonde actresses . otherwise , get a life
