i want my mtv ! if mtv was smart , and they used to be , along with funny , relevant , and entertaining ( they even played music videos all the time ! ) it was on all day in my house , and you could always count on the vjs passing along some wacky facts , or artists dropping by who could actually speak coherently . anyway , mtv could make their massive video catalog available to the public . you could browse online and choose the videos you wanted , pay $ 2- $ 3 each and mtv would either create a custom dvd for you and send it out , or you could download them and make your own dvds . i would gladly pay to have several dvds that contained only the videos i wanted . and there are about 100 i want , just off the top of my head . as it is , i am happy to watch my old and fading copies made back then and occasionally catch an old great on vh1 classic , rather than have someone else pick out 10 videos , 4 of which i may want , the rest i do n't . this one did nothing for me . luckily it was a gift . i never would 've bought it for myself
