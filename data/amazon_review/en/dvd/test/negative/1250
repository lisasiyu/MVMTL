possibly the most boring film i have seen ... unfortunately , i was made to watch this film in a french class i took . while i could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate , it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character 's face . it was honestly one of the most boring films i have ever seen . it 's difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters ' faces .
