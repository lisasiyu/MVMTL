can i get a refund for that ninety minutes of my life ? tangled ( jay lowi , 2001 ) shawn hatosy has been doing the character-actor thing in hollywood for a long time . lowi , in his first feature film , gives hatosy a starring role , and pairs him opposite established stars rachael leigh cook ( antitrust ) and jonathan rhys meyers ( titus ) , as well as throwing lorraine bracco ( the sopranos ) into the mix -- and he still ca n't come up with a good movie . now , i 'll watch jonathan rhys meyers in anything , and i have , and i still had trouble with this mess . the basic idea : david klein ( hatosy ) wakes up in a hospital with a police detective ( bracco ) at his side . it seems kelin 's girlfriend jenny ( cook ) and his best friend alan hammond ( meyers ) are both missing from the wreckage of hammond 's car , where klein was found . klein relates the story of the relationship between the three of them to the detective , piecemeal , with scenes from the present intercut . predictable , boring , cliched , two-dimensional , need i go on ? if the ending of jodi picoult novels comes as a shock to you , you may find the big reveal here to be a surprise . no one else will . *
