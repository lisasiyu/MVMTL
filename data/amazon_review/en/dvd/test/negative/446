where 's the funny part ? i tried . i really tried , but i was simply incapable of getting into this program . the lead character in nighty night is so thoroughly , contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes larry david in curb your enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear . this is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life . she 's also insane . completely . and not in a cute or funny way . she dose n't live in this world . she lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her , making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous , dishonest or rude . she literaly has no idea she 's a monster . i can see how that could be funny but not with this show 's incredibly dry , lifeless presentation . i never thought i 'd say this but nighty night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we 're supposed to laugh . and i hate laugh tracks .
