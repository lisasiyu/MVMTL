beware the fog ... literally . `` the fog '' is a fairly typical representative of a john carpenter movie . it certainly has its moments , yet it leaves the viewer with an unmistakable feeling of `` what might have been . '' in this sense it reminds me a bit of michael mann 's 1985 version of f. paul wilson 's `` the keep '' , another fascinating yet flawed horror movie which i watch over and over again in the vain hopes of discovering that it is actually good . stripped to the bone , `` the fog '' is the story of a small new england fishing town which is about to celebrate its centennial ( or bicentennial ... .or anniversary of some type ) . on the eve of this occasion the local priest , a drunken sot played by hal holbrook , discovers that the town - like all horror movie small towns - has a terrible secret linked to its founding . this discovery coincides with the appearance of a nasty fog off the coast which tends to leave dead people in its wake , and is moving towards the town . various characters in the town , including a local beer-guzzler ( tom atkins ) a nubile hitch-hiker ( jamie lee curtis ) a radio deejay ( adrienne barbeau ) and so on , are all isolated by the fog and soon discover what is inside it , and how it is related to the `` terrible secret '' , an old sin for which the modern-day townsfolk mist pay . as you can see , while the idea is not exactly new it is pretty cool , and when i popped `` the fog '' into my ancient dvd player recently i did so after a hiatus of many years , with the hope that my earlier judgement on the film was wrong . in this i was disappointed . like `` the keep '' , `` the fog '' never gets any better ; unlike `` the keep '' it actually gets worse . on paper this should not have happened . besides carpenter , who was coming off well-received efforts like `` assault on precinct 13 '' and `` halloween '' there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original `` halloween '' crew . besides carptenter and jamie lee curtis , there is also the girl who played annie ( michael 's first onscreen victim ) , as well as the guy who played the sheriff in both h and h-2 . replacing the ubiquitous donald pleasance is hal halbrook , and the venerable john houseman makes an appearance in the film 's opening as a creepy , storytellin ' sea captain . even janet leigh is involved , as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a fog victim . ironically , tis is part of the film 's problem , and it has many . first off , there are far too many characters . the film is cluttered with them and for some reason carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses . most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot , and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end . we needed more killings , not less . second , the performances . this movie has good actors , but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid . the worst of it is ladeled onto adrienne barbeau , who gets to repeat idiocies like , `` my son is trapped ! trapped by the fog ! '' and `` look out , into the darkness ... .and beware of the fog ! '' gag . third , the villain ( s ) . carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film , but he never delivers on it : there is no real payoff . this is because he could n't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was in the fog was the actual `` baddie '' of the film . the result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges . `` the fog '' might as well be a run o ' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal . the movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening , the moments of atmospheric horror at sea , and the excellent cinematography , which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers . but in the end these fail to outweigh the movie 's many flaws . as of today , i still regard carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there . on the one hand he gave us p-13 , halloween , escape from new york , and the thing , all classics ( cult or otherwise ) . on the other hand he also gave us crap like prince of darkness and the unwatchable ghosts of mars . in between there are the fun but flawed outings like they live and in the mouth of madness . i would like to say that the fog falls in this last category , but i really ca n't . it just is n't very good , and that 's the sad fact of it . bottom line ? beware the fog .
