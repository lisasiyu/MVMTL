a little good , mostly bad ... i had seen scenes from this flick on ifc , so i finally decided to watch the whole thing . while there are a few plusses , there are many more minuses . there was some really good production design here , the cinematography was good , and there are some funny moments ( one of the killers has a shirt on saying `` cheap halloween costume '' , and there 's a poster for a missing dog head ) . the performances by the 2 cops ( in one scene anyway ) are actually pretty good . i think this has to do more with the 2 actors than zombie 's directorial skills . now the bad . one reviewer has noted that essentially this is a remake of the texas chainsaw massacre , except nowhere near as good ( or intense ) . first of all , you do n't really give a damn about the victims here ( 2 couples who seem to despise each other ) . they 're really obnoxious and stupid at the beginning , and after they get abducted , tortured , and killed , you do n't really care . there are so many references to other horror films ( and some blatant ripoffs , especially of chainsaw ) that it seems like a cover version rather than an original film . the acting is obnoxious and pretty bad , except for the 2 cops . but even their performances are strange . they are only in 2 scenes . they are absolute jerks in their first scene , but in their second scene , they show some depth and are sincere . i think that 's indictative of the movie . sometimes it seems it wants to be funny , other times horrific . of course , there 's no real explanation to the actual `` house of 1000 corpses '' that one of the girls gets thrown into at the end of the film . zombie was n't trying to be ambiguous or anything . it just does n't make a damn bit of sense . and the ending sucks . it seems that they just did it to give it a lame twist ending . there are many plot holes ( after the police are killed , there are no cops that follow up on it . there would be in real life ) . overall , it 's a pretty stupid film .
