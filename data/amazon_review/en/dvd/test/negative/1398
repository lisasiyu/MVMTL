bad hair day mel ? i chose this film thinking it would be mel gibson when he was still good . yes , he was good , but i 'd seen it many years ago , when i was still at school , and did n't remember . until i was watching the film and thinking that i 'd already seen this before . i had an inkling that i 'd already seen it , when the girl jumped off the building ( i think i had a moan about why she had to be almost topless the first time round ) and then mel gets out of bed . i definitely remember that scene ! damn . the thing about watching lethal weapon now , is that it 's been either spoofed too many times or it 's been copied so many times . almost every 80s cop movie is like this . good cop , bad cop . neither wants a partner . then they realise they ca n't work without each other . and it spawns some mediocre sequels . in the case of the spoofing , see loaded weapon , with emilio estevez and samuel l jackson . there was nothing particularly stand out about this film - apart from mel 's hair , which was just awful - i liked the pairing of mel & danny , and i liked the albino gary busey , playing a bad guy , who does n't even flinch at his arm getting burnt with a lighter . ouch . the guy about to commit suicide from the top of the building and then having mel 's character handcuffed to him was the stand out scene for me , not including the opening scene . the reason i 'm only giving this 2 stars ( which is n't going to go down to well with some reviewers ) is because if i 'd seen it when it originally came out , i probably could have given a higher rating . but we 've seen it all before these days , and yes , it may have been a brilliant movie then , but not so much for me . for me , i would like to see another sequel to this . maybe mel could grow his hair again ? i mean , there is another indiana jones on the way , and another die hard . lets revive lethal weapon shall we ? you 're never too old , as harrison ford is proving and mel and danny are both younger . they could still do it . could n't they ? maybe mel could save his reputation . most reviewers consider this a classic , but in my case , it was worthy of a watch , but i do n't remember being that impressed by it the first time round . ( so much so that i did n't realise i 'd already seen it ! ) if you saw it the first time , relive the happy memories , and watch it on hd , cos it amazing . ( bearing in mind i did see it on video , so anything is better than that .
