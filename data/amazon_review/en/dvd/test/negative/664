the miracle of ... what ? this is my first time in this forum i 've seen the film of the 2nd disc and i found the copy ... not only bad but unnoticeable as a miracle the last three fellows have seen the copy in good conditions . it is possible that fox home video have changed and made new copies of the 2nd disc . if this is not true it is possible that they have discovered a fantastic ophtalmologist . i choose the first option . are you so kind -via fox- to inform us how to change the bad copies in order to have all the collection in good conditions ? yours r
