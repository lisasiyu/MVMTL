hard people to like . the film has its amusing and even touching points , but not very many . the big problem with rh is that neither ford or benning are sympathetic characters . henry is just the kind of self-important , ego-bloated , smug , arrogant , cold-blooded corporate ass that 's helped step on working people for real , so it 's really hard to feel anything for him , shot or not . he 's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him , and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is , if you think about it , appalling . and his wife is , in a way , even worse ; she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides . she goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up , and does n't become `` normal '' ntil much later . only their daughter has any heart at all . maybe a better ending would 've been henry 's not making it , bening going nuts from losing her stuff , and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should 've been from day one . barely watchable .
