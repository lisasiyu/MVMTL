poor adaptation this film is an adaptation of the first book in the new frankenstein series by dean koontz . i am not really a dean koontz fan and have only read a few of his books , but the first 2 in this series were excellent . ( i eagerly await the 3rd , which is past due to come out . ) this movie was a very boring , poor adaptation in my opinion . why dean has such bad luck with movies based on his books i can not understand . every movie version of his books has been really bad , this one is no exception . it is dull , which is hard to understand because the book is anything but dull . it is no wonder that dean took his name off this project . that should have been sufficient warning to me . if i could get my money back , i would . save yours , or better yet , buy the frankenstein books to enjoy the real story
