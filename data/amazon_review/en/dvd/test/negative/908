historically -- -but not comically -- -significant chaplin this 1914 film is considered the first feature-lenth comedy ever made and , as such , is worth viewing just for that . the film on its merits , however , is less interesting . sure , this is slapstick , but i personally found the tillie character to be quite ridiculous ; ridiulous , moreover , without being particularly amusing . she 's made up to look like -- -and seemingly acts like -- -a guy in drag pledging a fraternity . marie dressler , then 45 years-old , playing such a supposedly youthful character as `` tillie '' , to boot , is less comical than it is distracting . if you are going to take the time to see this film , in other words , you ought be doing so simply to see a historically significant film . so , no , it 's not a film you 'll most likely want to own and watch again and again , unless you 're simply enamored by anything and everything chaplin has done . if you have n't seen anything by chaplin do n't start here ! and if you are a discerning chaplin fan you 'd be better served ( if you care to be amused ) by sampling some of his much greater efforts . for the curious , i offer a brief synopsis of tillie 's punctured romance : `` what 's this he 's got -- -one of ringling 's elephants ? '' so remarks mabel normand 's character ( so to speak , in this silent film ) as she spies chaplin 's 'city guy ' arm in arm with `` built like a battleship '' tillie . tillie has `` got a bankroll as thick as herself '' , chaplin 's character later explains to normand , his old partner in crime . then once successful in lifting said cash from tillie , chaplin flees with normand . upon hearing of tillie 's apparent inheritance of 3 million dollars soon after , however , he returns to her and begs tillie to marry him asap . they later whoop it up with many quests ( with normand working as hired help ) at a celebratory party at tillies 's `` new '' home , until her uncle -- -thought dead -- -returns to claim it back , throwing them out into the street as he does so . a keystone-cops-like chase ensues all through town and seaside along a boardwalk and then ends with normand and ( a soaking wet ) tillie agreeing that chaplin 's favor is hardly worth pursuing anyway . curtain . cheers !
