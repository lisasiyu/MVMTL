missed potential and lame music there is some really great computer animation from this era , a.k.a some of the mind 's eye series and the like . but this one was , basically , a bore . first , the music was completely uninteresting and showed little or no connection to the animation . it sounded like half-baked baroque or classical done on a good-quality casio . i could live with that , though , if the animation really grabbed me . or , even better , if they seemed to have anything to do with each other . but the animation was , as my title implies , a tease . there were many , many brief moments were something truly interesting appeared only to be immediately abandoned for yet another kaleidoscope sequence . there was a lot of those . no , way too many of those . and i 'm sorry , but i can pick one up at the dollar store if i want to see that . also , if you hate having things flashed at you , there were a lot of those annoying instances where they transition from one image to the next with a bright flash . very obnoxious . for really good animation and music , in favor of this i 'd highly recomment televoid ( music by a mix of queensryche and kansas members ) and the gate to the mind 's eye ( thomas dolby ) . both these have much more interesting animation and really great music . as for this , if you already have any 90 's animation that you really like , you 'll be missing absolutely nothing by skipping this one
