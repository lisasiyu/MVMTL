0 stars : and this movie really , really , really deserves 0 stars ! ! `` an american werewolf in paris '' is quite possibly one of the worst movies i have ever observed . do n't even try to compare this to the classic `` an american werewolf in london '' . this movie is about as scary as `` the naked gun '' , the acting is pathetic and the plot for this movie is horrible ... i can not even bear to rehash it to you . there is nothing creepy or remotely scary about this movie ... it is just plain stupid . also , the werewolves in this movie look like some kind of a joke . i tried to keep an open mind , but basically , i could barely finish this movie and the best thing about it was when it was over and i did not have to watch anymore . total waste of time . i mean basically , this movie is a total `` zero '' and my recommendation to you is not to even think of wasting your time on this flick .
