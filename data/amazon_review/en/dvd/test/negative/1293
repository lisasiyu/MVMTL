way over-rated . i read so much about how `` creepy '' these holy grail of movies were . luckily , i did not buy the set . i rented it from a local store in philadelphia . i suggest renting them before making a purchase . i thought these movies were extremely dull , and not in the least frightening . tombs is the best of the four movies . but , it is really all downhill to the end . unless you 're a blind dead fanboy , save your money
