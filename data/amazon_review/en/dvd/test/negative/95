it 's flat & it 's not funny i love dave 's tv show , it 's really hilarious , so i was expecting a lot when i bought this dvd as part of a two-pack with richard pryor . after 10 minutes of dave , i started thinking , `` when am i going to laugh ? '' after 20 minutes , i got bored so i started listening to the audience for this live show . they were laughing ( a little ) & not all that often , so i concluded that it was n't just my mood , this just was n't funny . after 30 minutes , i turned it off . i can tell you that the first 30 minutes is a waste of your time , even if you 're a dave fan , as i am . i ca n't tell you if the rest is funny or not , because i did n't watch it . maybe i was expecting too much . maybe i was expecting richard pryor , which i had watched first . my recommendation is either to buy only the pryor dvd ( which is terrific ) , or watch the chappelle dvd first , so it wo n't suffer by comparison
