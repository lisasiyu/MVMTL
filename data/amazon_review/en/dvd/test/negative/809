pure dookey . i want my 78 minutes back ! spare yourself - do n't buy this cruddy film , and do n't waste your time watching it . think of all the wonderful things you could do in 78 minutes . call me old fashioned , but i have this little hang up about a movie having a plot and having structure . this is a desperate attempt to be artsy , which simply comes off as a bunch of film students fooling around trying to do something weird . endless repeated scenes with small variations , a `` mystery '' that really is n't much of one . courtney cox wearing awful clothes and ugly glasses and endless closeups of her looking gaunt and haggard to the point where i wanted to offer her a sandwich or something . dreary acting , dreary music . creakingly obvious attempts to be artistic by shooting portions of the film in bilious green or dreary blue . the same material recycled endlessly to the point where i hated all the characters , and did n't give a damn what happened to any of them . making a film without a single likeable character is a big boo-boo . if the audience does n't care , they might not hang around until the end , and if they do , they 'll feel as if they 've wasted their time . as hannibal lecter would say , tedious , very tedious
