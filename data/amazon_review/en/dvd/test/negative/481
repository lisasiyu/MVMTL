pathetic ca n't remember when i 've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this . a has-been silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer , down on his luck . the writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property , and hides his car trying to escape a finance co . the threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine . in one early scene they have a funeral , casket and all , for a monkey . yuk . gloria swanson was directed to play a woman who still thinks she can make a come back by writing her own script , though she despises movies that `` talk '' . she waves her hands about , and makes strange corny expressions with her face in every scene . she falls for the screen writer , william holden , and wo n't let him out of her sight . the film was made in 1950 , and swanson is supposed to be playing a woman of only 50 , not exacty over the hill ( if we look at many of today 's movie stars . ) but she 's treated in the film as though she much , much older . i thought she was supposed to be about 75 or so , but her age is mentioned towards the end of the film . my heavens , at 50 she could still be in movies , and from the amount of money she apparently had , did n't need to be living in such a dark , creepy house . film did n't make sense . sorry i bought it . it was ridiculous .
