she 's a better singer than comedian i loved borat , the jackass movies , the clerks movies ... all offensive humor but very very funny . so i thought i would like this . i hated it ! the so called jokes just did n't work . i do n't think it 's even the jokes themselves , but her timing , delivery , and especially her attitude of look at me , i 'm so funny and bad ! she 's not original , just a complete gimmick with pr as slick as her black hair . how much did audience members get paid to laugh ? or maybe it 's just a laugh track because the camera hardly shows the audience . it was a waste of my money and minutes of my life that i will never get back . comedy is n't supposed to put you in a bad mood . how could i not have noticed that 87 people are trying to get rid of copies ? i wo n't bother trying to resell it . i 'm just going to throw it in the trash and watch borat for some comic relief .
