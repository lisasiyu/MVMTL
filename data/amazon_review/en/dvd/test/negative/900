yes , this is really boring i agree with rigg_vienna . this film is one of the worst of all agatha christie movies . the version of 1981 with sir peter ustinov is much better , and not to forget such great actors like dame diana rigg , dame maggie smith or james mason . if you want `` evil under the sun '' , forget the new one and buy the classic one from 1981
