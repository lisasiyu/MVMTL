spend a couple hours of your life with 7 vile people of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie , the one i found most offensive was the one involving emilio estevez/andie macdowell . is n't stalking hilarious ? and is n't kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you 've ever seen ? i bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little kirby . i also loved at the end when ally sheedy tells andrew mccarthy and judd nelson that she just wants them `` all to be friends '' . to which they both reply the classic cinema line , `` ehhhh ... ok. '' wow . now that 's drama .
