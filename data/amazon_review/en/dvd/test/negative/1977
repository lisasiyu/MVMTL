buyer beware i give a 1 star to the dvd 's not the movies . just to let you guys know about a new collector 's box set coming out soon . read below . yes ... looks like it 's true . we 've known for a while now that warner home video was working on new dvd special editions of the superman films to tie in with the release of bryan singer 's superman returns later this year ( in theaters 6/30 ) , but now we have the first actual confirmation ... from ilya salkind , who co-produced the first three superman films ! salkind has acknowledged that he 's working with warner on the new dvds , and that all of the films in the series are being restored and given deluxe new special edition treatment , a-la last year 's batman anthology collection . by far the best news in all this , is that it seems that warner is finally allowing richard donner to create his original director 's cut of superman ii ! how damn cool is that ? ! as many of you know , donner directed superman : the movie and most of superman ii back to back , but was eventually fired from the sequel . director richard lester was hired to replace him , and it 's lester 's cut of the film that we 've seen all these years . what 's cool is that lester 's theatrical cut of the film is being given special edition treatment as well , so you 'll be able to fully explore both versions of superman ii on dvd this summer . lester may even do an interview for the dvd - something he 's been reluctant to do over the years given the controversy . this information comes from salkind via the superman homepage fan site , which expects to publish a full interview with salkind in the coming weeks . very cool news indeed ( though keep in mind that until warner announces this set , it 's all still unofficial ) . thanks to bits reader matt k. for the heads-up on this .
