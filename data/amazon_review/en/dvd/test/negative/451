the brat pack and those enormous granny panties this was the movie that gave us the brat pack , a staple of a certain 80s cultural set . the term brat pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in st. elmo 's fire on a boozy night of partying . since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who were n't in the movie ( anthony michael hall , for example ) suffered a bit of a ripple effect . here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl 's bedroom wall . out of all the dramedies of the john hughes movies , this was the one i liked the least . maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered . maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college . it was trying to be the next generation `` graduate '' movie , and i did n't relate when my time came . maybe it had to do with the fact that i have been let down by many people and did n't have that network of friends in similar situations , and the isolation i felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia . i guess i was just a little more bitter . plus , as my life was surrounded by work and little else , i did n't have all the dramas going on they did . that was kind of sad , the one scene where rob lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team . it proves you really ca n't go home again and there are some clinging to the past . not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it rob lowe finds those enormous granny panties . this caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset . it 's not a bad story , but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold .
