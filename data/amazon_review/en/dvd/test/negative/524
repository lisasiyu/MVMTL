shaggy dog this movie was very disturbing to me , i did'nt like seeing the freaky animals in cages.the frog with the dog head bothered me.i do n't recommend this movie for small children as they would take it too serious . there were some funny parts and tim allen played a very good role . i am an animal lover and i do n't like seeing any kind of mistreatment of animals even if it is a movie . now i know why this movie never came to my local theatre
