oxford is no miracle ok , the cover looks like a clone of miracle with kurt russell and that is about the best thing this movie has going for it . west looks really young so this is probably a made for tv british film that has been repackage to ride the curtail of west recent critical acclaim on hbo 's the wire and on the success of disney 's miracle . i did n't finish the movie because i honestly did n't care who won the boat race . unlike miracle which keeps you watching despite russell 's wardrobe and great looking toupee , this movie never draws you in and you just wish the boat would sink and drown the entire cast
