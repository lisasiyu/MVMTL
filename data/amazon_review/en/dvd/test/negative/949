car 54 , where are you ? what about studio 54 ? saw this movie once & do n't want to see it again . jim carrey , before getting more mature roles in `` man in the moon '' , '' eternal sunshine '' & '' truman show '' , indulges in endless slapstick , gets plenty of gross-out humor , beds courtney cox ( before `` friends '' , david arquette & baby coco ) & finds out oh ! the horror ! the horror ! he 's kissed a man.since this was before `` brokeback '' & heath & jake won their best kiss from the mtv movie awards , jim goes through an elaborate `` purification '' ceremony . it relies on gags ; this is n't a great movie.it ranks with `` wild wild west '' as one of the worst.do yourself a favor & avoid this movie
