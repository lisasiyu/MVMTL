how to make a bad dvd of a good concert aol music allows you to download the entire concert for free , which is far better than this dvd . this is not a dvd of the las vegas concert ; it is a dozen music videos , all of which were created from the concert footage . the director has chopped-and-diced this concert beyond enjoyment . the sound is not in true surround sound , and the mtv-style quick-cuts and wacky angles are so annoying as to make the video unwatchable .
