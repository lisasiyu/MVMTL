preview it before you show it . i bought this for my scifi class . we read bram stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film . it was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach . everyone was so disappointed . i kept waiting for it to get better and it never did . the history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you 've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up . the problem is that there is a month 's worth of boring between the good stuff . fast forward or the students who expect cgi will fall asleep if they stay in class that long . bela lugosi is a much better bet . for a silent , metropolis is much more compelling even to those cg fans
