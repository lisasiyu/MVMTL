great acting , but by the end you wo n't care for any of the three protagonists i came to this page struggling with how to encapsulate my take on 'dying gaul , ' but i see that amazon reviewer josh lanyon has nailed it perfectly : `` the actors were brilliant and the thing is so beautifully shot -- the music , mood , the little touches -- all great . and all rather beside the point . '' exactly . patricia clarkson , campbell scott , peter sarsgaard are all spectacular here . i thought scott was the standout . and , the movie looks incredible . but the dark mood of the movie got darker and darker ... and simply less likable . by the end , you wo n't care for any of the three protagonists . i watched the movie with two other people . none of us liked the ending ... nor did it matter by that point . we just wanted it to end . we were intrigued by the presence of an 'alternate ending ' on the dvd . it 's basically the same ending , but it goes on a bit longer and only confirms that the ambiguity of the released ending was intended ( one character expresses the ambiguity in a voice over )
