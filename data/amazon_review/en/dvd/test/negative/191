fails to come to a boil laura esquivel made the mistake of having her husband direct the cinematic version of her passionate , magical novel . lumi cavazos is a likeable tita , struggling with her forbidden passion for pedro.she 's a sympathetic character & conveys her pain with her eyes.for a talented actress , i wonder what has become of her since . marco leonardi is not as sympathetic as pedro.he comes across as a cheating scoundrel , causing pain for both his wife & his forbidden lover.one wonders why tita loves him so much , except that it 's forbidden.marco leonardi is , however , being true to the book.he uses tita for his own pleasure ; instead of bravely marrying her , he is a coward in marrying her sister & cheating on her . the movie renders less magical , or powerful , the scenes in the book.instead of making it wildly colorful it has the sepia tones more fitting for a spaghetti western.one expects to see john wayne riding to tita 's rescue . the magical scenes are hardly convincing , even for their time.the movie does have an excellent soundtrack.it 's far inferior to the delectable , sensual novel
