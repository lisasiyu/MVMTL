not so speedy really , the reason speed 2 : cruise control is n't a classic like the first one is because the speed storyline is not a bus , but a boat this time around . do you really think a boat can go as fast as a bus ? even if a boat is fast , do you think that 's more exciting than a bus avoiding danger in the city streets ? i do n't . what kind of amazing dangers can a boat avoid ? other boats ? ocean buoys ? a bus with a bomb underneath it is more rewarding to watch . speed 2 feels more like a way to cash in on the original . i watched the movie twice and was n't satisfied either time . it 's an okay movie , though . but do n't expect `` speed '' .
