good thriller , lousy dvd . bravo mgm ; you 've managed yet again to screw up a great movie with a terrible dvd . -it 's actually an orion picture , and i 'd hoped that they would 've cared more about its appearance , but no such luck . of my 100+ dvds , this is one of the worst looking with dull colors and a fuzzy image . ( let 's hope they 're more careful with their upcoming woody allen orion collection . ) this is a rather oldfashioned straight-ahead action suspenser like they just do n't make them anymore in hollywood , but it 's difficult to be thrilled about that when you know you can enjoy a much sharper version on tv . hackman , heard , cassidy and jones lead a good cast , but in order to see them clearly we desperately need a remastering of this otherwise wonderful movie . until then , avoid like the plague
