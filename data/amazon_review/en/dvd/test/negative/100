very stagnant i like francois ozon 's swimming pool a lot . i think he has caught a very exceptional line in that movie . but under the sand is a very typical french movie which makes most people do n't want to watch one as soon as they hear it is a french movie . i finally persuaded my husband that francois ozon is different and this movie will be good , it turned out to be a nightmare , pointlessly soul strangeling movie . i would not recommend unless you are a big fun of ozon or this type of movies
