the way not to do a movie about a t.v . show first they cast a black man as an undercover agent in the wild west where he would never be able to help as they would never let him in most places . remember this was before political correctiness or civil rights . then they turn one of the best villins on t.v . into a racist man missing most of his body . then they add state of the art f/x and think they have a great movie . it 's pure trash and gets one star because you ca n't give no stars . a waste and you should see the t.v . show if you want to see this concept really work well . just not good at all , a mess
