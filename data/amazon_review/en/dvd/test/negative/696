getting older not better the prisoner of azkaban young harry suffers as an adopted child and family servant . an insulting relative is blown away , and harry leaves too . a magic bus takes him away . the special effects are extravagant , but seem senseless . the oddities are like something out of `` star wars '' , amazing but irrelevant . the `hogwarts ' school seems to be overproducing the amount of wizards needed for their economy . or do they have a short life in their future ? great power may create great faults . the computer generated images are what makes this film interesting . the hippogriff looks great ! let 's hope it does n't drop anything on the students . sirius black has escaped from azkaban , where they keep the wizards who have gone bad . black is said to be going after harry potter ! this time we see the game of quidditch played in the rain . the winter scene and the invisible potter recalls `` the invisible man '' . overall there is a creepy feeling to the adult characters in this film . the story begins to drag in the middle , but a big black dog shows up to drag ron into his underground lair . a tree comes to life and attacks harry and hermione . then they find a secret tunnel that leads to the castle and a surprising revelation . [ does any of this make sense to you ? ] special effects are no substitute for a good story . it seems confused and meaningless . can the wing loading of a hippogriff support three people ? all seems to end well given the prior events . professor lupin resigns , his secret life-style has been found out and the parents of his students wo n't approve of this behavior . parents do n't like a teacher who exploits the students . `` harry potter '' panders to children in giving superhuman powers to a select few who are n't fit to handle these powers . or is this a subtle criticism of the aristocratic ruling class ?
