the movie is just as bad asthe book i 'm looking at reviews and people are saying , `` the movie is awful ! read the book . '' it 's true that the movie is one of the worse films you will ever see , buti advise you not to read the book . it 's too difficult to read and it leaves you with a headache . if you 're in school and you 're required to read this book , i suggest you just watch the movie ( get the 2 hours and 52 minutes out the way ) and get cliff notes . for real , do n't watch the movie or read the book unless you have no choice
