yawn my main dispute with this cinderella romance between young sisters and the conveniently available rich bachelor 's from far away america -- it 's rated r. why did the director feel it necessary to tell what is essentially a chocolate-chomping girl 's heartbreak with nudity and graphic groping ? teens love their romance , boy-girl breakups , and crush 's . this media world of overt-sexuality and easy porn - come on -- - let the kids have their childhood . oh , how many young sis ' have coveted their older sister 's boyfriends . all of them ! and that sexual awakening thing is happening at breakneck speed , but in 60 percent of american girls - the actual event begins with marriage . in this film marriage is not portrayed as something folks do for love : the sisters want to marry up at any cost . is that a good lesson for teen gals ? perhaps i 'm not being fair on the philosophical side , but how about a believable story we can care about ? you wo n't find it in i capture the castle . you 'll instead discover your first yawn developing about ten minutes into the production as the eccentric wife does her nude scene , the eccentric writer does his prison scene , the girls do their not enough to eat in this romantic castle scene , and suddenly the guys show up like price charmings out of nowhere like we have n't seen that one before . i 'm sorry . i think i 'll take a nap .
