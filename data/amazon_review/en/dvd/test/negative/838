not all that good . not a huge fan of james cagney or gangster movies , and nothing about white heat has changed that opinion . lame plot , corny dialogue , and just plain bad acting constantly had me cringing . in it 's day this movie was no different than the generic blow-em'-up action/adventure movies that hollywood has churned out en masse in more recent decades . hardly what i would consider to be a classic
