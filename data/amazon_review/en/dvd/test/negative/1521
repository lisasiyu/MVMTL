this movie has disturbing situations ... i bought these movies based on reviews and was puzzled when i noticed my 3 year old son was afraid of the green choo choo train . i could n't imagine why until i replayed the movie and saw the scene where the green train was headed toward a woman stranded , yes , stranded ! , in her vehicle on the train tracks . as she waved her arms in panic and stares at the oncoming train , she screams stop ! i can not imagine how this fosters a safe feeling for children unless you are into the scare tactic approach to teaching . i was really upset and offended that this was put into a kid friendly show . sadly , i do not recommend this dvd . the idea of it is great , but the delivery was more than poor . i will return the others i purchased
