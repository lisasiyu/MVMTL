not the best episode the world adventure teams dora with swiper -- that 's right , as friends . their mission is to save `` friendship day '' by replacing the bracelets that swiper had swiped . it is really sad that on a trip around the world they did n't visit any country where spanish is spoken . and what 's more , the plot is really boring . nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid . the songs that swiper and dora sing together are lousy . nothing about the songs is catchy or fun . another odd thing is that dora 's voice is different . it sounds like they could n't get the same actress they normally use to do dora 's voice . dora sounds older . there are a lot of fun dora videos out there but this is n't one of them
