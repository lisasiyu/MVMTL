lord of the , oh i mean feet of flames . this should be titled lord of the dance not feet of flames . the two shows are almost identical . if youv'e seen lord of the dance then you have seen feet of flames . there are a few minor changes here and there but basically the same stuff . my biggest gripe is that flatley seems way to full of himself in this one ! i mean he is so in love with himself its anoying ! i truely enjoyed his dancing in the original riverdance filmed in ireland , but id say after watching feet of flames he deserved getting bagged on by mike meyers ! ! ! the sensuality is bit more ramped up in this show , and it reminds me more of vegas show than anything else . can someone please knock some sense into flatley so he can fit his swelled up head through the door . that way i can go back to enjoying his dancing with out his puffed up ego
