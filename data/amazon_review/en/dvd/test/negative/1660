`` best show ever '' ? on what planet ? so now we have the female version of '' oz '' ... '' oz '' of course was the american cable soap opera show about a bunch of notorious scum , which treated these losers in such a way as to make thier rotten lives , twisted morality and worthless goals palatable..of course the '' critics '' loved this show , but then again the '' critics '' seem to love anything that is not decent , or made for the mainstream audience ... this is why the '' people 's choice '' awards differ so greatly from the other `` professionals-only '' awards shows , like the oscars.. '' bad girls '' is merely an '' oz '' retread , only this time around the losers are females ... the plots are much the same..the same sort of bottom-feeder losers , only this time they have jiggle ... the same sort of rotten lives , the same sort of twisted goals , the same worthlessness of charecter ... most of the charecters in both `` oz '' and `` bad girls '' ought to be put to death rather than glorified on a teevee series.. '' oz '' and this garbage are poster examples of why there ought to be a death penalty that is universal and immediate upon conviction ... one can only wonder what bottom of the barrel group our '' entertainment '' industry will glorify next ? maybe some enterprising , and perverted , mind out there is even now writing the pilot script for `` a year with adolf , eva , goebbels , himmler , the concentration camps & you '' , in which the nazis are seen as just plain folks , misunderstood in thier race-baiting and thier mass exterminations ... why not ? every other bottom-feeder group seems to be getting a cable soap opera show that seeks to portray them in other than realistic terms , so why not the nazis ? and after the nazis , can the inquisition , or the armenian genocide be far behind
