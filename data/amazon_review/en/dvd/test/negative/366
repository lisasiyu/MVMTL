bidi bidi we have trouble buck i gave this a 2 star review not because i do n't like the series but the way the disks were processed . dvd-18 has flaws big flaws and the episode near the outer edge of the disk often suffer the most . i have purchased other universal shows which had less problems . airwolf , the a team , ect . the only saving grace is i have a number of dvd players so i have managed to salvage all or most of the br episodes . why put all of the episodes on 5 disks ? to save money but they charge big bucks for the sets
