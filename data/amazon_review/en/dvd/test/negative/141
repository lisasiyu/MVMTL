typical rom-com for genre/bullock/affleck fans only if you 've seen one you 've seen them all . uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl , she brings him out of his shell . well , i bought this for like two dollars , and maybe it was worth it . i watch it like once a year . no special features on dvd worth mentioning . ben affleck is getting married , he has to fly down to the south from ny for the wedding . but things keep getting in his way . forces of nature . also , he keeps running into , and ca n't seem to get away from , some weird chick ( bullock ) . are these signs ? should he stop being so uptight , and go with this free-spirited chick ? or should he be an adult and get married and accept his vanilla lifestyle ? the acting in this movie is `` meh '' , meaning sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie ; and affleck sucks , as usual . the other small parts are well done , for the most part . the script is formulaic , and the cinematography at times is interesting . it 's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell . the movie opens with a stripper scene , no nudity . there is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie . there is also a scene where affleck strips at a gay bar . just thought i 'd throw that in , in case you 're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something , and that kind of thing bothers you . you only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic , or a big fan of either affleck or bullock . otherwise this is completely forgettable .
