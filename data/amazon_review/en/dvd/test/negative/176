stupid packaging & shameful offer when you receive this set , they offer a regular box you can set on the shelf , for an additional $ 2.98 . what arrives four weeks later is a piece of folded paper that makes a slip cover for the already very poor disc holder . 20th century fox entertainment should be boycotted . they make almost three dollars on something which costs them likely 8 cents - all in addition to the original cost of the discs . i love the simpsons , but i am returning this piece of folded paper along with an invoice for a four disc jewel case
