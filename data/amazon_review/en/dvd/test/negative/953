could have been worse ... rest stop ( john shiban , 2006 ) writer/producer john shiban makes his feature-film directorial debut with rest stop , a slick little thriller that wants to be far more than it actually is . while this is an admirable goal , it 's never possible to fully forget that the movie 's trying a bit too hard . still , it 's a vast improvement over a lot of recent damsel-in-distress flicks . nicole ( watch over me 's jaimie alexander ) and jessie ( joey mendicino in his big-screen debut ) have run away from their small-town texas home and are on their way to los angeles when they pull into a rest stop . after the required bathroom break , nicole comes outside to find jessie has disappeared . she also discovers the rest stop is the home base for a particularly nasty serial killer who 's been picking off young girls there for a very long time . she 's forced into a game of cat and mouse with the guy , and finds herself questioning her sanity more and more as the game goes on . yes , there are plot holes big enough to drive a yellow pickup truck through . and yes , there are some awe-inspiringly stupid moments ( especially the final scene ) that make you wonder whether anyone at the production company actually read the entire script before bankrolling this thing ( i kept thinking it was the filmed equivalent of a novel published by xlibris ) . but shiban was at least trying , and you have to give him a few brownie points for that . i mean , how seriously can you take a movie that casts joey lawrence as a cop ? and how seriously are you supposed to take a movie that features the camper family to be found in the middle of this one ? it 's entirely possible that the most you 'll get out of this movie is a few laughs , a few hours of nitpicking with your buddies , and some awesome eye candy in the for of jaimie alexander . still , that 's a whole lot more than you got from haute tension . *
