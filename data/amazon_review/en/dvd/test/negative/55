the carpetborers this overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish . it does n't work as good trash or as high camp . edward dmytryk directs harold robbins ' source material with a lead foot . george peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on `` the a-team '' . alan ladd , who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit , essentially sleepwalks through this picture . it 's equally unfortunate that talented actors like carroll baker , elizabeth ashley , and martin balsam are associated with this swill . heck , i even feel bad for former boxing champ archie moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy . the film 's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by edith head ( the women 's lingeree in particular ) . if you must waste 150 minutes of your time it 's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow
