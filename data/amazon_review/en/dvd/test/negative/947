lousy lousy lousy contentwise , i wo n't toss darts or roses . this is genre stuff . you either like it or you do n't . my beef is with the technical quality . it is execrable . ( 1 ) it is not in widescreen ( cinemascope ) , which it ought to be for a biblical spectacular . there is simply no excuse for cranking out a full-screen treatment in a dvd issued in the year 2000 . ( 2 ) the so-called `` digital remastering '' must be kitchen-table grade , because the shapes are fuzzy , colors oversaturated , visuals mushy . this dvd should be withdrawn from the market and a new widescreen version substituted . i get better quality from my vhs of this movie than the dvd i purchased . lousy lousy lousy , as i said .
