made-for-tv rubbish combining dialogue that appears to have been lifted from old political pamphlets with a rock music score more appropriate to a modern cosmetics commericial ( lots of guitars and vibraphones , let 's call it `` rock on with nawsa '' ) , this film tells the viewer much more about hollywood femnists ' perceptions of the past , than it does about the past itself . all decked out in edwardian costumes , the cast works its way through a series of thankfully brief scenes in which enlightened women slay dominant males with verbal ripostes and quips , all loaded with telling facts and figures that reveal the extent of sex discrimination in the progressive era . these scenes also include the occasional disgruntled woman , for the moment reluctant to enlist in the movement , yet after being exposed to a few suffragist talking-points , she too will take up the banner and join the nawsa crusade . perhaps the most forgettable moment in two hours of not very clever dialogue came early on when alice told a washington post reporter : `` i 'm having dinner with helen keller . '' the reporter , `` do n't stare , she hates that . '' yet , i suppose the most annoying aspect of this film is the music : rock is not only inapposite to the 1910s , it is completely at odds with the seriousness with which suffragists conducted their campaigns . indeed , one of the few songs the producers chose from the early 20th century was `` ai n't she sweet '' -- a roarin ' twenties jazz standard introduced in 1927 by paul ash & his orchestra at the oriental theatre in chicago and thereafter adopted by such entertainers as eddie cantor and sophie tucker . alice paul was hardly a flapper , nor was she an astute poitical strategist . she was a militant activist whose overwrought contribution to winning the vote for women only complemented the much greater , much more productive efforts of carrie chapman catt ( angelica huston ) and others who had continued the struggle since seneca falls in 1848 . catt used paul 's antics to good effect in eventually persuading president wilson ( here , woefully overweight ) to endorse suffrage as a route to victory in the great war . paul was at most a footnote in the process . i showed this film to my gilded age-progressive era class last spring ; consider a few written comments from today 's undergraduates : `` disjointed '' -- `` historically inept and emotion-ridden '' -- `` this was hilary swank in insomnia part 2 '' -- `` numerous historical inaccuracies included women 's hair and men 's clothing styles from later eras , the misuse of props like a small woman 's wrist watch and a crown graphic press camera , both of which did not exist in 1918 , plus the american flag behind wilson is hung backwards '' -- `` the parts where she ( paul/swank ) was jailed reminded me of that holocaust movie by speiberg , but his was more convincing '' & my favorite : `` why not really screw it up and throw in a little helen reddy at the end ?
