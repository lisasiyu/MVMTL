well shot , terrible ideas first off , i found this movie finely played and edited . but i was truly shocked at lester 's pro-castro ideology . we 're en 1979 for christ sakes ! ca n't we have some true historical facts ? did n't you hear about the trials , the political prisoners , the crowds of people trying to escape the totalitarian regime ? no , the bad guys here are batista people , potrayed like mere pigs . i 'm glad this movie did n't catch people 's attention , it 's nothing but propaganda . and like a previous reviewer said , it must be castro 's perefered movie , well done lester , accomplice of the castro 's killings
