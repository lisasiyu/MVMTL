big , brash and boring the movie `` extreme ops '' which opened to lukewarm reviews and even more lukewarm box office really should carry a government health warning with it . it is so mind numbingly incoherent and lackluster that one can feel your brain cells being depleted one by one after each comic strip moment . let me take that back because to equate comic strips with this piece of drivel is a disservice to comic strips . this movie has no plot and no characterization . the point appears to be to display some `` amazing '' stunt work but the effect is spoiled by an over usage of truly obvious computer generated effect work that would not look out of place on your home play station . the plot , and i use the term loosely , concerns a group of commercial filmmakers who travel the world in attempts to catch stunts on film . they have been hired by a japanese businessman to catch shots of a skier racing ahead of an avalanche ( the reason why is never really given ) so this ragtag group heads for austria . why they made the decision to film the shot in the alps instead of the perfectly good rocky mountains is similarly never explained , except that it allows them to come into contact with a sneering serbian war criminal fresh from faking his own death . understandably the sneering villain is none to happy to be sharing his mountain hideaway with an obnoxious group of teenagers . he , like the theater audience , seems to find them just as annoying as we do , but whereas we have the liberty of tuning them out or , even more sensibly , walking out in the middle of the movie , he takes a more homicidal approach and decides to do away with them . i usually try to find some good points in a movie i review so it is somewhat balanced , however it is hard with this flick to find something positive to say , i guess one could point out that the girls are good looking and the scenery is equally pretty - does that count ? do yourself a favor and give this a miss . i would also recommend that you pass it by when you see it on dvd shelves . there is absolutely no redeeming feature to this dull , dumb movie
