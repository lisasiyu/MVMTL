dreadful when it comes to cheap productions , this awful little mess should rank near the top of the ( garbage ) heap . script , acting , and production values are nil , and it appears that the whole thing was shot with a home video camera ; however , it is far less entertaining than the average home video . it is an utterly pointless waste of time and money , and should be marketed only as a cure for insomnia . when compared with the bozos who made this film , ed wood looks like cecil b. demille , and that is a notable accomplishment indeed . the size of the budget does not determine the quality of the film ; however , when coupled with a dull and pointless script , sleepwalking actors , and the incredible ineptitude of the writer/director , the low budget does n't exactly recommend it . admirers of this film are certainly welcome to it ; those of us who are evidently not as intellectually gifted can live without it . the debate over this film is rather like the story , `` the emperor 's new clothes '' , in that those who look hard enough for something will generally see it , whether it exists or not . this sorry mess is n't worth the pomposity and arrogance with which some persons choose to approach it . personally , i find this film to be an abject waste , so number me among the numbskulls .
