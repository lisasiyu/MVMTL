a pleasant scott western that could have been more any western boasting the likes of randolph scott , ernest borgnine , and lee marvin should be an all-time great , but stranger wore a gun proves that his films with budd boetticher were far superior to most of his films , and makes you wonder what scott 's boetticher films would have been like if he 'd had such great co-stars as he did in this film . scott plays a former confederate spy who joins with an old war colleague to stage a gold robbery in arizona . scott changes his mind , and tries to stop the robbery . george macready , playing the bad guy , is his usual despicable self , and marvin and borgnine are solid as usual as two of macready 's gang . one of the problems with this film is that it was filmed for 3d , which is obnoxious and distracting , as objects and people point toward the screen for an effect which is no longer viable . the dialogue is also not as cleverly pointed as it was in scott 's better films . stranger wore a gun is not a bad film , but not in scott 's top five best westerns , and possibly not even his top ten
