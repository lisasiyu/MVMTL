john tucker lives ? ? ? okay the person that puts this movie in the same catogory as `` bring it on '' , `` clueless '' , `` mean girls '' and , especially the superior `` heathers '' .. is painting a false picture of what this movie is.. i 'm sorry but , `` john tucker must die '' is no where close to being as sharp or clever as these other mentioned films . these other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers . `` jtmd '' appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all i did . this film tries taking alot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one big mess . 2.5 stars is all i can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket . `` heathers '' = 5 stars . `` mean girls '' = 4 stars . `` bring it on '' = 4 stars . `` clueless '' 4.5 stars . all four of these movies have something that `` john tucker must die '' doesnt have..
