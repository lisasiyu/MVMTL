definitive portrayal of generation x ( for what that 's worth ) many reviewers and critics said it best ... what do you do when the `` hero '' of the film ( ethan hawke ) is a complete a -- -hole , winona ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give ed wood , jr. a run for his money , and stiller , who is supposed to be the bad guy , actually is n't that bad of a human being ? and winona 's friends are the smarmy , arrogant , generation x punks who think they know everything ( when the reality is ( forgive the pun ) they do n't know jack ) . past generations would quote tolstoy and shakespeare , generation x quotes tv commercials , scooby doo cartoons , star wars , and bad sitcoms . generation x is probably the most insincere generation ever , detaching themselves and calling themselves `` ironic '' , when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism . is this film an accurate portrayal of them ? yes , in some ways . is the film worth watching ? yeah , at least once . stiller gives a decent performance , it 's nicely shot , and garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth . this is probably due to the fact that garofalo actually has some substance herself , as opposed to the character she plays . check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film .
