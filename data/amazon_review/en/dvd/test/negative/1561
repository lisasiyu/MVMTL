robbed my time burglar is your typical d movie . it has more bads than goods . actually , it has a ton of bads . when i sat down to watch this film , i did n't expect oscar worthy material . but , i did expect something that would at least halfway amuse me or even keep my interest . i did n't get either of them . yes , the acting was all right . whoopie goldberg is a great comedic actress , but she should really be a little choosier when it comes to picking what movies to be in . burglar moved at a snails pace , and that is putting it lightly . there were way too many coincidences . there would just happen to be a bag with valuables in it laying around , or there would just by pure coincidence be a motorcycle with the keys in it parked in an alley practically yelling at you to be stolen . also , the directing was terrible . the director did not explain things well at all . the only reason i stuck around to the end was because to see if my prediction of who the killer was right . and of course , i was right . the plot was paper-thin . i do n't like a movie when i know the ending a quarter into the film . overall , burglar is a definite waste of time that now has the title of & quot ; most predictable movie ever. & quot ; 1 sta
