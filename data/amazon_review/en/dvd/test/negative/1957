2 1/2 stars ! this is not the worst gore film eva made but not as good as expected ! lamberto bava 's `` demons 2 '' just does n't quite live up to the classic status of the original . the quality of the gore really dropped a few notches compared to part 1 & lets just admit it now & get it out of the way ! the gore is pretty much the only reason to watch these kind of cult films ! `` demons 2 '' lacks the ripping & tearing of flesh & limb that made the original `` demons '' such a fun classic & instead replaces it with alot of guewy & slimey stuff & a very stupid demon puppet ! while not a complete waste of time it definately fell short of my gorey expectations , especially considering the two maestro 's who held the reins ( argento & bava ! )
