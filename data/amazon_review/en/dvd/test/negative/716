not quite as enthralling as i had hoped ... granted , i should have seen this coming , having read louisa may alcott 's predictable preteen novel before buying the film version . i guess i was hoping that the movie would fix up all the flat characterizations and narrow plotlines i had lamented while reading alcott 's early piece . alas , i put too much faith in cinema . the movie did absolutely nothing to improve upon the book . the main female character is far too demure and morally perfect to connect in any real way with her audience ( which actually seems to sell more books than i would think , as per janette oke ) and the female antagonist is villified to the extent that she no longer seems human . the male love-interest is the traditional tall , dark , handsome , and vacuous one who , though faithful to his love , lacks any sort of purpose outside of wooing her . overarching these characterization flaws is a general lack of cinematographic care that relegates this movie to the `` made-for-tv '' genre , which , though not dominated solely by poor films , is not known for its quality . to me , it was much like watching a lifetime movie : predictable , entertaining for lack of an alternative , and not terribly significant . do n't read me incorrectly . this movie is great for anyone who is just plain bored . if you do n't enjoy actually watching the movie , you will probably enjoy laughing incredulously as each character delivers horrible lines . hey , it 's only 6 bucks , anyway . why not buy it and see for yourself ? it 's what i did , and just because i was disappointed does n't mean you have to be
