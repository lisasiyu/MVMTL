you had to be there made for a pittance , initially released in just two theaters , ultimately grossing over ten million dollars , `` sweet sweetback 's baadasssss song '' became the progenitor of the `` blaxploitation '' film craze of the seventies . considered a seminal film in african-american cinema , director van peebles feels it influenced the independent film movement as a whole . its jazzy editing and strong hero set it miles apart from the standard fare - one can see how african-american audiences could see this film as a long-overdue cinematic thunderbolt . the plot is simple . sweetback ( van peebles himself ) has grown up in a bordello to become one of its central attractions . one night , he agrees to accompany a pair of police officers downtown for questioning . a murder case lacks suspects , and the gesture appears to be compensation for the force 's lenience toward the establishment . en route to the interrogation , however , the police intercept a youth on the street and brutally beat him . using his handcuffs , sweetback kills both officers . the rest is a protracted chase , with sweetback using his fists ( among other body parts ) to make his way to the border . the police question his companions , hot on his trail with guns , bloodhounds and ( at one point ) a helicopter . van peebles has an eye for a striking shot , and there 's some vivid scenes of police officers brutalizing sweetback 's friend beetle that get their point across . while its historic contribution is clear , `` sweetback '' has little to offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value . van peebles is a strong presence as the laconic hero , but there 's not much in the way of narrative or memorable characters to savor . there 's plenty of sex and violence to be had ( the 'x ' rating is fully earned ) , but it 's episodic - much of the film seems to be an enormous montage of repeated street scenes and dialogue clips , and the effect rapidly becomes tiresome . thirty years after its explosive release , `` sweetback '' will remain compelling for film historians and students . its torch has been passed on to to other filmmakers , but the pioneering effort itself has not dated well . ps - the dvd release has an interview with the director . initially , it shares some formal similarities with the feature , but later it settles into some interesting ( and amusing ) anecdotes . pps - i just saw `` badasssss ! '' ( mario van peebles ' docudrama on how `` sweet sweetback 's baadasssss song '' was made ) last night ( 10/25 ) . it makes for a great double feature , as it really helps you to understand how difficult that production was
