i did n't like it ... for good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years . surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films , but at the same time they 'd like an anime feel to their films ... what 's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing , creative , and powerful . this film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it is n't . this did n't have an anime feel ... which was n't really a problem for me - i 've seen a number of anime movies which were serious , but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come . trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about christmas ( how many damn christmas-happy movies do we have out there ? ) , this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them . `` a christmas story '' and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within tokyo godfathers . are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a japanese animation ? i doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great ( they were not , but that 's beside the point since visuals are n't all that matters ) , i doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original ( the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of `` odd fellow '' characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own ... except she is a transvestite , really a man ) . i feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it , but i can only guess that they have n't watched very many christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately . the director however is one of my favorite - i deeply enjoyed perfect blue and millennium actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though i 'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to `` cling '' onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table . furuya was successful in taking a bland film , creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again . the audience bought it up ... too bad . you do n't need to feel ashamed to say it really is n't as special as it tries to present itself as . oh well , perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film . here is the film 's ultra-negative review by an informed reviewer ... i sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as `` unhelpful '' because they disagree with it ( then again , that 's the style on amazon these days is n't it ? )
