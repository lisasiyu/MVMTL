not a `` killer back '' workout i purchased this dvd assuming there would be exercises for both the back and abs areas . the focus is on the abs , where the back comes into play . but there are no exercises designed just to targot the back . in fact , michael barely mentions much about the back except when talking about good form . a good cardio workout , alot of jumping in the first segment- you will feel your calves burn . a good abs and waist workout as well . there are alot of twisting moves . the exercises are very similar to tae-bo , and i would recommend a tae-bo video over this one . michael only performs half of the exercises himself . he also seems to favor one girl over the other through his attention . i would n't go through this workout though , and think that it was designed by somebody who had years of boxing experience . he also uses handweights , a jump-rope , and a body bar during the workout . but its easy to manage without them .
