love affair - just another updated classic that did n't work many of the reviews i read felt strongly in favor of this remake , but some of the people had not seen `` an affair to remember '' . cary grant & deborah kerr had the spark so lacking in this `` love affair '' remake . the original `` love affair '' with ( forgive me , i can only remember irene dunne as terry , and my opinion that film was not as good as this `` love affair '' , however . i missed hearing the original scoring of `` an affair to remember '' , but annette benning 's music with the children was lovely . as most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of `` an affair ... '' , i missed the climactic ending with cary grant 's reactions , and also the shipboard scene where he want 's to be `` worthy of her love '' . i do n't wish to underrate or `` dump '' on this film , but i wish all reviewers would watch the grant/kerr version just once . i believe they will become `` old movie buffs '' too . thanks for reading my review
