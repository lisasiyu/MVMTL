kung-pletely disappointing ! i love jackie chan . i love his stunts , his martial arts and the honor and humor that envelope his movies . this movie , put simply , dissapointed me . granted i watched half an hour of this movie and ended it there . the movie lacked the usual enthusiasm and honor of a jackie chan movie . i was put off by the cops hanging suspended in the air gasping for breath , the gory blood and the constant reliance on violence to get it 's point across . many jackie chan movies get their point across without senseless , over-the-top and disgusting violence . the movie is poor quality , low budget , which i generally like being a fan of all things swordplay fantasy kung fu and martial arts across the board and through china and flowing into korea and japan . this movie , however , lacked anything redeeming ... atleast the part of the movie i watched .
