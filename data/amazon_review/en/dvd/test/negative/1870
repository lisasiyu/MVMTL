big diappointment i would not recommend buying this dvd . poor production value and if you are expecting to enjoy some music by christina prepare yourself for disappointment and boredom . it 's about 90 % pr people ranting about christina and her accomplishments . i admire christina 's music and her god given talent for singing along with her hard work but this dvd is definitely worth passing up . i would recommend the stripped concert in the uk but not this one
