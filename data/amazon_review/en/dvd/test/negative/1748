two girls , a guy and a complete waste of time love heather graham and that is why i bought this movie . the `` explicit sex scene '' is not explicit and in fact , is not much of a sex scene . great idea and could have been a great movie . talent was there , opportuinity was there , but all wasted . totally out of reality as to how this would have gone down as well . it would be every guy 's fanatasy if the two beautiful women he was `` doing '' found out he was canoodling each of them and when they find out all they do is chew him out for not being honest about it then say , `` i know , why do n't we all three date . we can be a triple rather than a couple . '' yeah , that happened with all the women i ever dated
