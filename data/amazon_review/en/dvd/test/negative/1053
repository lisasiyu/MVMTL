sloooooooooooooooow and booooooooorinnnnng john le carre ' novels are all crawled forward like snail . reading his novels are just like reading those novels of those written in 19th century . his novels about cold war were like a guy walked in a dream , they have to be tolerated with extreme patience , because the blah , blah , blah sometimes would make you lose focus . this 3-dvd movie is just like his novels , so slow and so boring . i do n't believe any reader under 30 years could read along with great enthusiasm , his novels are written for the folks wearing bi-focals sitting on the recliners . i do think if all the spies who were caught and then put in jail during the cold war , there are 3 ways to make them confess and sing like canary : 1 ) force them to read john le carre 's cold war novels to bore themselves to death ; 2 ) force them to watch these 3-dvd movies , smiley 's people & tinker , tailor , soldier and spy ; 3 ) force them to listen to the sound track of 'sound of music ' 24/7 . they 'd be either gone crazy or hang themselves in their cells or , talk very soon : )
