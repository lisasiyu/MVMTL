so many gaps in the story this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u.s. to escape the persecution he 's suffered in cuba . and that 's about all that can be inferred from this movie . there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language . but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what 's going on . this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all . whatever the message of this movie is , whatever it 's trying to convey , it 's lost in the plotless story
