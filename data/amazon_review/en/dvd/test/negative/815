a great film given the basest possible dvd treatment from fox lorber most of those who were lucky enough to see this stunning srdjan dragojevic film at select film festivals in the u.s. have not forgotten its clarity , its anger , and its power . the movie was passed up for theatrical distribution , although it was readily available on vhs and now on dvd from fox lorber . this dvd is a bust in every thinkable way , although fox lorber was obviously aiming very low . the phrase `` bare-bones '' is usually used to describe discs that are given rudimentary , dismissive releases , lacking supplements that more presumably marketable titles might warrant . this dvd does contain a trailer , but the trailer , sadly , looks better than the feature . `` bare-bones '' would have been fine , but watching this disc is torture . it 's obviously a quickie transfer from the vhs -- i could have produced a better amateur transfer -- with a loud hiss tainting the soundtrack throughout , poor audio balance ( with dialogue pulsing between speakers in an artificial echo ) poor contrast , a muddy , dark image , burnt-in subtitles , and so forth . fox lorber were long the scourge of the art-film dvd market , and their soulless neglect of their titles has never been more apparent than in this disc . new yorker and wellspring ( formerly winstar ) are guilty of similar offenses
