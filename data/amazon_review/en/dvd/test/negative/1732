dull , baby ... dull ! as a gothic-horror-lover i bought this according to the high-praising reviews , acclaiming it as `` atmospheric '' , `` moody '' , `` stylish '' , `` gothic horror gem '' ... well ... if you ever saw terence fisher 's 'horror of dracula ' from 1958 ( in fact 10 years before this film ! ) you know where the benchmark for classic gothic horror lies . this hammer horror movie masterpiece delivers not only the visual beauty of gothic atmosphere and technicolor delights , but also magnificent performances and dynamic suspense . kill , baby ... kill ! whereas is really a lame and tedious experience in this genre . despite of its overly moody gothic sets , the suspensful musical score and the lush settings and colors , there is really not enough atmosphere or suspense that may grip you and get you into the story . the plot is very weak and holds no real surprises . overall it looks rather cheap and lacks of good performances or dialogues ( whereof there are few ) . the repetitive all too long `` creepy shots '' can get really annoying even if the director tries really hard to make suspensful hitchcock-style camera work . sorry , but that 's not enough . this is neither a real gothic horror ( cause it 's too cheap ) nor a giallo ( cause there 's no gore ) . if you think that gothic atmosphere sets , `` endless spiral staircase shots '' and a more or less creepy child staring into the camera are enough to make a good horror movie , then this one 's for you . to everyone else i recommend any cushing/lee hammer movie or v.price poe movie for real atmospheric classic gothic horror !
