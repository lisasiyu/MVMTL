a disappointment in a way ... for some reason , or at least the way the album was introduced , one may assume that there is a lot here to enjoy . unfortunately it is not the case . the album is more for floyd 's fans who are eager to have all the small details.well , personaly i do n't care that much about these details , all i want is the true staff , for that i would recommend to those who are hesitating , do n't buy this dvd , buy the cd ... or wait for the true dark side of the moon
