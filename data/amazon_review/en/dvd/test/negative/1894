i will never watch this again ... . as a lover of many types of music , this movie sparked my interest ... .so i rented it . i found myself thinking throughout the movie `` i ca n't believe i 'm actually watching this . what a waste ! '' not only was the plot slow to the point of boring , but the film exalted lesbianism to the point that i ( as a grown woman ) actually fast-forwarded through a couple of scenes . the small amount of goodness in the movie was not worth all of the disappointing twists and turns of the story . also , please carefully consider before allowing children to watch ! ! i will never , under any circumstances watch this movie again . ( i want the reader to know that i am in no way a movie critic . i am writing this strictly as someone who wishes to steer others away from what i found to be a complete waste of an evening .
