a 'difficult ' movie ; unfortunately , it ai n't very good either it 's always a shame to see a really talented actor/ actress star in a dud of a movie , but that 's exactly what happened to jodie foster with 1979 's `` foxes '' . directed by adrian lyne , who would later go on to direct the notorious `` fatal attraction '' , `` foxes '' is a cheap , lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life . the movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another , making it hard to stay focused . the movie is n't a total waste -- a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention ; and jodie foster , still under 18 when this was filmed , has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she is n't given much to work with . plus , that piano melody of donna summer 's `` on the radio '' which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel . overall though , `` foxes '' really is pretty lousy and ca n't be given much of a recommendation
