memorable orientalia wasted on poor film stock ! being an oriental i am fairly familiar with films released by our geographical neighbours , although not as extensive as standard hollywood productions . with japanese films , whether it was made by a kurusawa or a more obscure artisan , i can fairly adjudged them on a whole as lethargic in pace , inconspicuously lacks background music/instrumentals , and are generally pressed on celluluid films that are simply comparatively substandard . village of dreams , while touted as an award winner is a glaring testimony of this stunted japanese film-making characteristic . review it yourself . the pace alone wantingly needs tighter editing . it was the same character that can be seen even in kurusawa 's ran - a & quot ; highly acclaimed & quot ; work that in my case , i could n't even view for the third time , because even its dvd resolution has a quality that can only be likened to the eye-view of a person who 's suffering his earliest stage of creeping glaucoma . village of dreams is so & quot ; relaxed & quot ; as if the filmmaker expects people like me to have an available time that they enjoyed in 1940s japan in an obscure countryside . at the very least , the straight narrative of this film is a consolation , but with ran , the actions were so hard to follow , you 'd be puzzled who was fighting and attacking whom . the most unforgivable quality of this dvd transfer is the poor film stock . the picture approximates that of a & quot ; third generation & quot ; recording of a vhs copy . this means that you 'll be sorely dissapointed of having to get a vhs-quality copy copied , in turn , from another vhs copy which was copied from the original vhs & quot ; master tape & quot ; . of course , the dvd transfer is not at fault , its simply that the japanese despite their touted techno prowess just could n't give us a decent film stock , that could at least preserve their comparatively well-made gems . the glaring deficiency of films like this comes even more obvious , when shown on high resolution tvs . i 've viewed this film in a 29-inch sony wega flat tv , and in a 50-inch mitsubishi projection tv , from a pioneer dvl 919 and 909 . if not for the antics of the two children leads , village comes off as wearisome . i bought this film despite its hefty price tag mainly because i 'm a film collector . its works like this that whets my appreciation for world cinema . unfortunately , village 's poor resolution takes away gratifying cinematic enjoyment , as well as negating its & quot ; collectability & quot ; factor . this should have looked more glorious if it could approximate the celluluid quality of examples like what dreams may come or dark city , but of course that 's asking too much from those editing-challenged japanese filmakers . i want to ask amazon for a refund because this is not well worth its price value . i was compulsed to buy it because of its cover , i thought it was at least as exotically glorious-looking as kundun , but it proved to be just a small , obscure production . critics may raved about it , just like those canadians did with black robe , but the final word is that they 're just run of the mill , albeit thoughtful , films ... .
