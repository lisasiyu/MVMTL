do n't waste your money ! unfortunately i did n't read the reviews below before i bought this dvd . it 's a travesty of the dvd medium . perhaps fox lorber took the story of the movie too seriously : they 've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy . do n't waste your money on it
