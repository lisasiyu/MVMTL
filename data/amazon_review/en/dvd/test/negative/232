the world 's full of lonely people patrick dempsey had an usual niche in the 80s teen comedy , as did the characters he played . he was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in , somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance , but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end . here was no acception . he plays the lovable loser once again , this time he was an arrogant , cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college . disappointed and angry at his failing grades , his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place . while patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor , he encounters a beautiful , mysterious stranger who ( like the plot to a bad porn movie ) makes his job worth while with no strings attached . while this fleeting encounter might have ended there , the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this , and soon patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy . the smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that . long before desperate housewives he was their afternoon delight . what was amazing to me in watching this movie is that patrick did n't have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires . he is simply a friend , a companion , someone to talk with . i guess i just do n't understand why some of the women he was servicing did n't try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head . of course , as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did , it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving . that 's an urban ledgend if there ever was one . i gave this only 2 stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words . still , it is a commentary on the world being full of lonely people
