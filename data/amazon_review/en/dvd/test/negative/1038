not so good this one was made after disney died , billy mummy is too old for the role he plays , and it 's often too dark , and it sometimes really drags . mummy 's scenes -- where he 's supposed to exhibit deep emotion and sympathy -- are as annoying as fingernails on a chalkboard . better to buy charlie the lonesome couger , or the one about the yellowstone bears or the earlier version of `` the incredible journey , '' the one they only have on videotape
