not very memorable i love jackie chan and all of his movies , buy i will admit this is not one of his best . it 's quite bad actually , i bought it cos it was cheap and i like to own all of jackie 's movies in my collection . not even claire forlani could really save this one , she looks totally out of place in this movie . i only recommend it to serious jackie fans , i could n't imagine anyone else getting through the whole 85 minutes
