apathy for the sake of apathy ***contains spoilers*** it 's probably fun to make a movie about yourself -- or one that focuses closely on you -- and that is what director solondz has done with storytelling . not only is the film divided into two nearly unintelligible segments , it is further broken down during the final section by portraying a down-on-his luck director ( paul giamatti , the illusionist ) who is obviously a doppelganger of solondz himself . overflowing with apathy , storytelling has two distinct parts : `` fiction '' and `` nonfiction . '' in fiction , which launches the film , we 're introduced to vi ( selma blair , hellboy ) , a young new jersey college student involved in a writing/literature class that concentrates on critique . her boyfriend marcus ( leo fitzpatrick , the wire tv series ) has cerebral palsy and it appears the only reason she 's with him is because of her apathy toward college life and those that haunt its halls . the teacher of the class is a forbidding black man named mr. scott ( robert wisdom , also from the wire ) , a pulitzer prize winner who 's flat affect and bored demeanor heaves a heavy shadow over the class . but apathy attracts apathy in solondz story , so vi and mr. scott have a sexual encounter , if for no other reason than to slip out of their routines and into one another . there 's actually some interesting dark sexual comedy here , but it quickly dissolves . perhaps `` fiction '' was part nonfiction , too , as one could easily see solondz sitting in a class , reading stories that get sledgehammer critiques . the second and final portion of storytelling is `` nonfiction . '' here we find toby oxman ( giamatti ) , a man who ca n't seem to finish anything . but when he discovers a young kid named scooby ( mark webber , the memory thief ) who mirrors toby 's own apathy toward life , the wannabe film maker believes he 's found a new calling : to make a documentary about society . john goodman ( o brother , where art thou ? ) stars as scooby 's father , a big man that pushes his kids and family too hard to become his ideal nuclear family . his wife fern ( july hagerty , airplane ) is just as disinterested in life as the rest of the cast , but hides it behind a facade of smiles . the only empathetic character in the webber household is the maid consuelo ( lupe ontiveros , tortilla heaven ) who gets fired because she shows some interest in life . toby oxman films all of the webber household people but keeps his focus on scooby , whom he sees strictly as a character subject . that the film ends abruptly with the death of scooby 's family , and we still see no emotional response from him , only adds to the viewer 's anger that there 's no one in the film to care about . no protagonist that we can get behind . no angst from any of the characters . they are blobs of human flesh pooling around each other in uninteresting ways . directing a movie about apathy has been done before ; american beauty is probably the most notable of these . but the characters were multifaceted and you cared about them . here in storytelling , the premise seems to be filming a flick about apathy just for the sake of showing apathy
