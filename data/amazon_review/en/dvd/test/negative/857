dreary , hard to watch . given high acclaims this film has collected over time , i was glad to pick up a vhs copy at my local library sale . began to watch it last night . i was able to sit thru the part 1 . when the tape ended , i was actually glad . i felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1 ! the movie is dreary to the max . people portrayed are irrational , lost , uncommunicative , and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers . in some way , this movie reminded me of the dreary winter ( lasting 6 months ! ) i spent in russia a couple of years ago ... to me , the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of soviet state ( 1920-1956 ) . for survivors , nothing made any sense anymore , except perhaps fear and evil , as people in this dreary film reflects . people have been already destroyed in their souls . they are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience . maybe that is the real meaning of this movie . to really reflect what happened to people 's psyche after lenin and stalin 's unlimited terror , they found a parallel in mongol 's devastation and oppression of medieval russia . in both cases , people were left shattered , helpless , irrational , withdrawn , and autistic .
