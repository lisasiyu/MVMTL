can we be proud that we are american 's for once the film why we fight , i believe is nothing more than another movie that looks to criticize america . i felt that the movie , only told one side of the argument , and that side was clearly not pro-america . the film portrays the united states as a power hungry nation , which is looking to create an empire and extend its influence around the world . the film constantly criticizes the decisions of america leaders to engage into foreign combat . the film however , does not present an alternative solution . it fails to take into consideration that america may be acting out of self defense . the film constantly criticizes america for engaging in combat throughout the world . what i have to say to the director of this film is : is it not alright to defend your nation , after terrorist drive planes into two buildings , killing 3,000 people ? is it not alright to defend your nation against religious zealots , who are looking to destroy your way of life ? is it wrong to attempt to bring freedom and peace to the middle east , by toppling a murderous dictator ? when i see these questions , i have to answer no to all of them . i feel that if america feels threatened , it should not have to seek permission to defend itself . president bush put it properly i feel when he stated `` after the chaos and carnage of september 11th , it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers , '' and `` america will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our people . '' this film can criticize america and label it as a bully nation , but these terrorist must be brought to justice . president eisenhower once said , `` peace and justice are two sides of the same coin . '' as the most powerful nation in the world , it is our duty to spread freedom throughout the world . it is our duty to allow the people of other countries the privilege of enjoying the same rights that we as americans , sometimes take for granted . since when , has it become wrong to defend your nation . why must america be criticized for engaging in conflict , when it feels threatened ? is it not the job of the president of the united states to defend the 300 million people he was elected to represent ? does anybody think for a second that these people would hesitate to attack america again , if they are given the chance ? we can never let our guard down . freedom does not come free . on september 11 , 2001 we saw firsthand how evil , those who want to destroy us can be . you can not negotiate with these types of people . the only way to solve this problem and protect ourselves is to act decisively with force . on the morning of the september 11 , 2001 attacks , president bush stated that `` freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward , and freedom will be defended . '' indeed freedom was and is being defended , and i see nothing wrong with that . words are not enough to protect our nation . president theodore roosevelt said , `` great thoughts speak only to the thoughtful mind , but great actions speak to all mankind , '' and our great action , will be to defend this great nation . in the words of president hoover , `` freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity , '' and it is america 's job to ensure that the people of the world have the opportunity to live in freedom . remember : `` words without actions are the assassins of idealism .
