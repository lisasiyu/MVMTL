not what i expected . do n't waste your $ $ i was a big fan of the st1 . the plot and characters were excellent , it rated up there with the best of them i would give st1 5 stars . i saw this was on sale for a great price so i got it expecting great things . usually sequels are n't to par with the originals so i at least expeted a 3-star movie . when i flipped on the movie i said `` wow ... .right where they left off '' at a pretty good battle seen with the bugs . well , that was it i was waiting for more action . i waited ... .i waited ... i waited and i waited ... they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still was n't worth it . i do n't know who 's idea it was for the sequel but i hope this was their last one . i 'll stick with the new battlestar galactic and star trek reruns
