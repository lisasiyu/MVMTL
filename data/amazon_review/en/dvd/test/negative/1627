pure poppycock single mom moves with her 2 daughters to an isolated property up in the mountains that she recently inherited . there , they encounter zombie kids killed off in a mining accident at the turn of the century . while the acting is somewhat decent ( and the only feature of merit in this flick ) everything else screams - generic . poorly paced , poorly written and completely derivative of several dozen movies you 've seen before . sadly , i 've seen made -for-cable-tv cheeseball flicks on the sci-fi channel with more appeal then this . definitely feel free to skip this film in the after dark collection
