disappointing ... a beautifully shot movie plagued by a terrible script and bad acting . russell crowe should n't try the hugh grant shtick ! the movie had all kinds of potential as a story but it falls back into hollywood 's story template mire . hollywood wo n't take any chances , it has a few plot lines that it uses over and over . hollywood believes that audiences are too stupid to think for themselves so they put out movies with few surprises , are totally predictable and feature characters that you have seen before . you know how this story is going to unfold within the first 15 minutes . the only reason to watch this movie was for the cinematography and albert finney 's performance . he commands your attention , fills the screen with his acting . a superb performance . many have said it is the new `` french kiss '' . though the story lines are similar , the direction and character development in `` french kiss '' was much better . kevin kline 's acting and character development were excellent . if you want to see this genre done really well , watch the film `` mostly martha '' directed and written by sandra nettelbeck . no , it 's not about martha stewart . `` a good year '' would have been a much better film in her hands
