90 % of video does not match music . the very best of the dj tiesto real live show is the amazing synchronization between the music and the show ( lights , fireworks , etc . ) this dvd is totally unsync ; and does n't make justice to the real thing . the real thing is just amazing . the dvd version is just bad ; very bad . more than disappointed i hate the moment when i made my decision to bought this dvd . realy bad ! !
