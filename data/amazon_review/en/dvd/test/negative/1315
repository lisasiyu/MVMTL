the sittaford mystery i have been an ardent fan of agatha christie and jane marple for 40 years or more but if this had been the first christie movie i had seen it would also have been the last . i had a hard time recognizing any of the story in this movie . in fact i stopped and reread the book to be sure i was not completely off track . this is a perfectly good story ruined by overzealous 'modernization ' and revision . geraldine mckewan certainly makes a poor jane marple but this is the first one i have seen her in so she might grow on you after a while . i liked the way the story developed and the way it was solved but the story line was completely ruined by the movie . i suppose the movie would have been better if i had n't been a jane marple fan but she was completely extraneous to the story in this one and really did n't appear to contribute to the story at all . i was planning to buy both series of these movies but now i will wait for something else
