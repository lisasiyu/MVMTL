could have been better gay guy tells straight guy that gay guys can get any girl . straight guy tests this out and supposedly , fiasco occurs . well there was a fiasco : the acting , the script and the lead actor ( guy who plays straight ) because he painfully upstaged the rest of the cast . he does a good job in a bad script . the guy that plays his roommate ( the straight guy 's roommate ) is a horrible actor . he made me flinch everytime he delivered his lines . the rest of the cast was 'high school production-esque ' -- i especially liked the trampy girlfriend . she kind of reminded me of a non drag version of devine . i do n't remember the names of the characters because most of this movie is forgettable . some of the scenes were funny when they were n't supposed to be and others were awkward when they were supposed to be funny . there is a little girl ( straighty 's sister ) that also has some funny lines and fairly good delivery . if you want poor production , bad scripts and bad acting , you can either rent america 's funniest home videos or this movie . both have some decent moments , but neither of them are worth buying on dvd
