mary ann and sissy spacek i saw this movie quite a few years ago ( probably about 15 or 20 years ago ) . i must say the first time i saw it i was n't really impressed . then i read a review of it and the review stated how great it was and that marvin was excellent and that it was just a great movie . so when it was released on dvd i went out and purchased it . i remember little about it from the first time other than it had sissy spacek in it in one of her first roles , if not her very first big screen role . i must say that i did n't find this movie any better now than i did then . i appreciate marvins career and his acting as well as gene hackman . these two guys are two of the finest actors of my time but this movie is just not that good . the story could have been much better and the core of it is good . marvin is a respected chicago underworld enforcer who is sent on a mission by eddie egan ( the real popeye doyle from the french connection drug bust in new york ) to collect $ 500,000 that an associate name mary ann has forgotten to pay . mary ann ( gene hackman ... and do n't ask me why he is mary ann cause they never explain it ) is in the mid west and has a meat packing place and slaughter house . he has sent back several other bag men to the chicago mob processed as hot dogs and hamburger after he has killed them . mary ann also is now with marvins old flame clarabell ( jeez what is with these stupid names ? ) . mary ann also deals in white slavery , enter sissy spacek . he sells and displays these girls nude in the same livestock pens full of hay that he does his pigs and cows . this is an interesting novelty kind of movie . if you are a fan of marvin or hackman check it out . even if you are a fan of sissy spacek . but alas this movie is just not that good . the old school mob vs the new middle america mob that has reached even the heartland could be interesting and is a little bit but this is just a pretty bad movie .
