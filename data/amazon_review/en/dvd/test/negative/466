rent , do n't buy i rented this thinking it was an audrey tautou flick , but it is n't . she 's front-and-center on the cover line-up , but she 's only in a few scenes . that is n't the real reason why i think that this movie is so-so . there really is n't much in this movie that i have n't seen done elsewhere . i kept thinking that i 've seen other movies do this or that better . then again , i 've seen a lot of foreign and independant films , so i 've gotten a bit picky at times . nothing was really clever or memmorable about this one . it 's a mediocre flick , i do n't know why it got rave reviews . i remember seeing the dvd in a sale bin at a discount store for $ 5 but i thought it would be a waste , because seeing it once was enough and i do n't feel like i 'll ever need to see it again
