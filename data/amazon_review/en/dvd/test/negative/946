disappointed i had high hopes for this . after spending $ 24.95 to buy it , and watching the first disc , i do n't even feel inspired to watch the other discs . i am an alcoholic myself , and have been sober ( thanks to aa ) for 11 plus years . i work in the medical field , and am exposed to addicts of every stripe on a daily basis . i found the ballyhoo surrounding the release of this confusing . perhaps it just shows the hunger of the american people to learn something , anything about the subject of addiction . it is a complex subject , and i did n't find any answers here . i 'm not sure exactly what the purpose of the show was . if it was strictly to educate , i found it to be an extremely non-cohesive hodgepodge of information that did't include some of the most important ideas about addiction . it was like a puzzle that all lay strewn about on the table so that you could n't figure out what picture it was supposed to be - and with some of the pieces missing , to boot ! if it was to inspire addicts or their families to get treatment for their addiction , i did n't feel in the least bit inspired . i did not leave the show with an uplifting feeling , or even a scared-and-need-to-do-something-about-it feeling . i left the show vaguely confused , not much liking or caring about either the addict subjects or any of the researchers . there were exceptions , of course . i enjoyed the night in the ed segment , and i found the steamfitters to be very `` real '' and human . addiction is a terrible disease , and it deserves better treatment than this . probably the main thing that i did not like was that the whole show seemed slanted towards `` magic bullet '' thinking , which does a disservice to the addict . that is , over and over are mentioned `` exciting new medicines '' and `` getting the right medicines and the right treatment to help the addict '' , which i find dangerous and misleading . that is , it leads one to feel that the solution to addiction is just getting hold of one of the new `` miracle '' drugs touted . perhaps the show was funded by the pharmaceutical industry . `` miracle drugs '' which will solve an addicts problem nearly effortlessly and painlessly have continually popped up over the years ( antabuse and ssri antidepressants come to mind ) , and none have a very impressive track record . in fairness to the show , they do mention some of this , but it seems buried in the more frequently talked about glamour of the next `` miracle drug '' . i was particularly amazed that amongst all of the brain scans , scientific speculation , and such , that there was no mention whatsoever of any 12 step program , or any proven treatment center such as hazeldon or the betty ford clinic . because the reality is , while these scientists are busy engineering the next ever more detailed brain scan machine , there are real humans out there in the world who are successfully helping their fellow humans to get clean and sober . what a concept ! and without miracle drugs even ! getting clean and sober is not easy , and it does a disservice to addicts everywhere to a ) give voice to the magical idea that some miracle cure is going to solve everything , and b ) not to mention real life programs available now ( often free ) that have proven track records , and offer real hope . if you like science , be aware that alcoholics anonymous has been shown scientifically in study after study to have the single best track record at keeping alcoholics sober . is it for everyone ? no , but if you want to get ( and more importantly stay ) sober , the odds are better with aa as a follow-up ( after initial treatment ) than with anything else that you can name . `` it works if you work it '' as they say in aa . i have no direct experience with other 12 step programs , and so ca n't comment , but i know that they operate very similarly . why on a show about addiction would they not mention any 12 step program ? i sat with my jaw hanging down as i watched the entire show , and aa was only mentioned twice : once by a woman early in the show who had been sober for 17 years or something `` through aa '' , ( that in itself is an amazing accomplishment , and should say all you need to know about aa ) , and later in the show on the steamfitters who formed their own support group basically because they felt that going to aa would be somehow 'wimpy ' for manly men like them . i do n't where they got that impression , because i 've never heard of aa being called 'wimpy ' ( or whatever term they used ) . aa 's full of bikers , construction workers , etc. , right alongside the doctors and lawyers . that 's the beauty of it : it recognizes that addiction knows no boundaries , and shows what we addicts have in common . the irony of the steamfitters is that the little group they formed is almost exactly like an aa group and meeting ! i was laughing - there was almost no difference . so if you want to know what an aa meeting is like , watch the steamfitters . the sense of caring about their fellow man who is an addict like them came from the deepest depths of human caring and no-nonsense facing the facts . and the power of `` it takes one to know one '' that lets them get their fellows to let down their barriers and listen is exactly why aa is so effective . who wants to listen to a scientist ? if you 're an addict or an alcoholic , you want to listen to another addict or alcoholic . they 've walked a mile in your shoes . so to me the show was a moderately boring stream of blah , blah , blah with little real inspirational meat or insight . if you want some real scientific insight into how this `` brain disease '' works ( at least the alcoholic version ) , try the book `` beyond the influence '' , available from amazon . good meat there . if you want to see some good talk from people who have ( to me ) better insight into the whole addiction thing , search online for the larry king live addiction show which featured jamie lee curtis and betty ford 's daughter from the betty ford clinic . transcripts are available online . it was an incredible show . coincidentally , one of the `` researchers '' who appears on the hbo special was also on the larry king show , and it was slightly embarrassing to watch his miracle drug theoretical approach to the subject next to those who are actually down in the trenches with addicts on a human level . you will see what i 'm talking about .
