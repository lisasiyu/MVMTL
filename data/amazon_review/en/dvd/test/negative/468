did you all miss the boat ? after viewing the 7 faces of dr. lao i must agree with the march 10th , 2000 reviewer who states strongly that this is just a solid `` b '' film . when i was growing up i spent many hours in movie theaters watching fantasy and sci-fi films . george pal movies were always among my favorites and still are . to make statements that the 7 faces of dr. lao was george pal 's greatest film is unfounded . have these people ever watched the time machine or war of the worlds ? if we are talking about great fantasy or sci-fi movies , which george pal should be remembered for , then you do n't get much better than these two . the only credit to this film is the scene where dr. lao shows the town 's people the movie clips of the roman city being destroyed by a vocanic eruption . the eruption scenes are taken from another george pal classic fantasty film , atlantis the lost continent . now there is a great film to entertain the children . the only problem with atlantis the lost continent is that for some unknown reason it has not yet been released on dvd . for those of us out there that still enjoy great fantasy films from the past , drop the studio a line and lets get this one on the market
