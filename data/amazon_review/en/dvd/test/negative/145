maybe it just has n't aged well ... ok , i 've only just seen this film for the first time , so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect , but this is not a particularly good film . i mean , it has its choice moments where it really comes together . the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed . any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status . samuel jackson 's in it . and if you 're a fan of dave chapelle 's tyrone biggums crackhead character , the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity . but that 's really my problem with this film . serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting . and they 're all here : the homey black grandparents , the nation of islam convert , the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine 's road ... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth . take the french film 'la haine ' , for instance . it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society , boyz n tha hood , etc. , but its characters actually feel tormented , instead of just having lots of scenes written for them to show their torment . rather than just running through a laundry list of problems , one-by-one , scene-by-scene , it really gets to the heart of something bigger , some grander alienation that urban youths feel , which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do . plus , if you can believe it , the hip-hop in 'la haine ' is quite a bit better . so while i would definitely recommend seeing this film , keep the remote aimed and ready , finger on the fast-forward button . maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching , whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising . oh yeah , and there 's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason . oh , also , the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees . in a film that did n't try to carry so much social weight , that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking , but it really just cheapens this one
