game 6 : the $ 500,000 movie - four strikes , you are out . out ! upon the brief trailers and dvd cover that gave me the visuals of this show , i thought i would really enjoy it . it was set 20 years ago during the famous world series made infamous by a single error that ended up keeping the curse alive and putting into motion ( later in the series ) the mets ( led by such greats as lenny dykstra and daryl strawberry ) beating the red sox ( roger clemens , wade boggs , to name a few ) in that world series . the error goes down as one of the most famous in all of sports . that , however , is in the foreground , much like the yankee 's world series was ( led by reggie jackson 's heroic and never ending home run hits ) in the movie `` son of sam '' serial killing spree of sam berkowitz in nyc in the 1970 's . at first glance , i thought there was going to be a series of dramatic events that lead up to a climatic conclusion , all the way down to the end when bill buckner misses the easy grounder to first base . what we end up getting is one of those movies that tries to execute a series of characters and events in their lives , tie it all together , and have some meaning come out of it . the result is what i should have expected from a movie whose budget is a tenth of what some players make nowadays : dull , boring , spinning wheels that get stuck , continue to spin , and lead nowhere . there is nothing poignant , profound , or purposeful with the script of this movie , and if there is , i guess i was to wrapped up in watching the red sox let another one slip away . first off , we have a decent cast to say the least : michael keaton , robert downey jr. , and catherine o'hara ( home alone fame ) are all actors who have shined in the past and though are n't so much of household names anymore , can still carry their craft to the greatest of limits . the problem is not them . the problem is the script ! michael keaton is a man about to go through a divorce . his daughter is busier turning the volume up on her walkman ( remember , this is 1986 , not 2006 ) and he 's seeing a lot of things unravel before his eyes . it does n't seem to bother him much though , as the character keaton plays ( nicky rogan ) is a famous playwright in the big apple who seems more interested visiting with multiple cab drivers in a day than anything else . the camera is always showing the cabbies id cards on the dash to make sure we know that they are from the middle east . strike one : this little display does n't seem to get anything across that has any purpose or direction with the film , and seems not only unnecessary , but also ultimately annoying after about the fourth cab ride . rogan is about to have a personal drama performed and he 's not sure how it 's going to be perceived by the masses . strike two : despite all the things outside rogan saying he 's supposed to be worried , scared , or bothered , he does n't really come across that way . if anything this character acts more like a fake puppet than a man with any emotion , feeling , or personality . he is supposed to be nervous because critic david schwimmer ( downey jr. ) is going to be the major reviewer of his new play . schwimmer himself received a bad review or something and is now some sort of syd barret ( see : pink floyd founder/drugs/gone crazy supposedly/left band/becomes artistic recluse ) in his apartment and seems to spend most of his time just staring at walls and acting like he 's had a lobotomy with a drill that has a low battery . strike three : this entire subplot never takes off and despite bringing this character into the foreground , including a standoff with rogan in schwimmer 's apartment with rogan 's teen daughter half naked on the couch , it just does n't fly . by this time in the movie i 'm saying i do n't really care . i 'm going to give them one more chance at bat ... strike four ! : at one point in the movie , rogan is told he should carry a gun for safety . okay i 'm thinking there will be some bernard goetz ( see : bernard goetz/weird engineer/ny resident/4 would be robbers on subway/goetz shoots them/becomes cult icon/hero/crazy dude for self defense and gun ownership ) type situation brewing . the gun is fired off in schwimmer 's apartment a few times but nobody gets hurt ( thankfully , i mean i did n't really want anyone to get hurt ) . after that ( i 'll call a ball one ! here ) schwimmer and rogan sit down and start talking because they realize they have something in common that is a stronger bond than most realize : they both are boston natives , and huge red sox fans . rogan 's mistress , who happens to be funding his new play , and rogan 's father , who is in ailing health and rogan visits now and again , make guest appearances . there are a few bright spots in the movie when things like the already mentioned red sox bond come into play , but ultimately this thing is over by the fourth inning . sure , the fat lady is n't singing yet , but like they said in the special features part of the dvd ; the world series was n't technically over for the sox in that game , as the loss forced it to game seven in which the mets ultimately won , but it did n't matter . every fan knew it was a done deal , despite the hope . in the end rogan skips his plays debut and ends up offering the cab driver that happens to have her grandson with her ( nope , this time its actually someone not from the middle east ) to go to a bar and watch the game . the actual footage of the game was fun to watch for this sports fan , though i still feel bad for buckner , and all the bosox fans , when that ball went through his glove and the mets scored the winning run as a result . special features : in trying to be objective to my own criticism of this film , i learned that there were basically two ideas ( 1986 world series & playwright vs . critic showdown ) that were eventually melded into one . although its not a total loss considering the movie did surprisingly only cost half a million dollars to film , its not a gain at all because the script in regard to the playwright vs. critic storyline is way to loose . it never really comes across strong and again , with the exception of the bosox tie between the two men , the journey to get there is filled with eccentric drivel and boring dialogue that do n't hold up well at all . i understand its an `` unconventional film '' but that does not excuse it from having a weak script and scenes that are made epic but ultimately deliver nothing of substance in the film . in the end , this sports fan was pleased with the different people involved with the film telling where they were and how they felt when buckner missed that ball . it 's to bad that kind of passion was not put into a stronger script that helped tie the themes and overall storyline together better . oh yeah , i gave it an extra `` strike '' , and its still here . sorry , you are outta here ! game over ! see you on the `` field of dreams '' someday in rerun land .
