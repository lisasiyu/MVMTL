0 stars : lord have mercy ! ! ! `` the church '' is nonsensical rubbish . i know dario argento is weak on plot , but this movie is absurd . it 's interesting how argento does such a good job with a movie like `` suspiria '' creating such an effective atmosphere for a horror movie even though the plot is a bit shaky ; but , with `` the church '' , the creepy atmosphere is clearly not present , and the acting and execution of the screenplay are so bad which only magnifies how terrible the plot is ... the result is a disaster ! ! indeed , there is zero character development , horrendous acting , monstrous plot holes and an uneven screenplay , all of which lead to this piece of rubbish called `` the church '' . this movie is trash ... period ! stay away ! ! ! !
