terrible..terrible boring movie ! i am a lover of japanese movies . i even purchased a masterpiece ( sadakan no . 8 ) for $ 50 for a vhs . i have a huge collection of japanese jems . so i know what i 'm talking about . heck i 'm even japanese myself : - ) but let me tell you -- maborosi must mean major boring..this movie can be condensed easily into 30 minutes and probably be still too boring . yumiko is traumatized as a kid as grandma says she wants to go away and die ... please stop you are too young to die..but grandma leaves anyway and yumiko dreams about this repeatedly . yumiko has a hubby and kid and hubby commits suicide . she mops throughout the movie from start to finish . she wears nothing but black and rarely smiles and sustains a flat affect . a totally unrealistic movie ; in real life , yumiko would have to worry about getting a job and pay bills rather than worrying about her psychological traumas because she has a kid to take care of . ( her husband was some kind of laborer . ) the movie is dreadfully boring . boring . boring . boring . it goes into trivial daily life and irrelevant conversations and becomes the whole of the movie with very little plot . it goes on and on and on making you sleepy sleepy sleepy ... masterpiece -- how on earth ? ? ? ? ? it 's another example how winning an international film prize does not necessarily mean it is good . now if you have problems with insomnia or need a sleep remedy-please by all means purchase this . it 's hard to follow only because it puts you to sleep sooo well ! i 'm not exaggerating . if you decide to purchase this boring movie , and believe the hype of the critics as it is highly overrated , well , i warned you . thank you
