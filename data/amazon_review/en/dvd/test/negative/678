such a sad way to end the series ... i fell in love with the anne of green gables series when someone loaned us the first movie . i immediately went out and bought the books and found the 2nd movie that sullivan made . the first two movies were outstanding and did an excellent job of telling montgomery 's story of anne . like many other fans of anne , i anxiously awaited the third movie , hoping to see the marriage of anne and gilbert and the beginning of their married life and the starting of their family . there is wonderful drama in the books of this period of their lives . i thought , too , that a final movie would be very successful if it dealt with the wartime drama situated around anne & gilbert 's oldest daughter , rilla . what sullivan presented , however , after two wonderful movies , was not only a desecration of montgomery 's writings , but also just a bad movie . if you have recently discovered anne of green gables and love these tremendous stories , i strongly recommend that you buy the first two movies . by staying close to the text , sullivan managed to deliver two incredible movies , and meegan follows is simply incredible . based upon sullivan 's commentary 's in the movies , however , we should consider ourselves lucky he got these movies right , because he really does n't seem to `` get '' what makes montgomery 's stories so wonderful . this is even more apparent with the 3rd movie , which i can only guess sullivan put out there to try and make some extra money . first of all , it has nothing to do with montgomery 's actual stories . sullivan should have kept to directing and left story telling to montgomery . second , the movie is just bad . it was a couple of hours that , unfortunately , i 'll never get back again . as other reviewers have commented , i own the first two movies and love to watch them with my family . they are *perfect* family movies with incredible stories and superb acting . the last movie should n't even be considered part of the story . it 's bad . do n't waste any money on it
