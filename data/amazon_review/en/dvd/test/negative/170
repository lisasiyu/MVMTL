the guys ca n't act i 'm not a professional critic or one that watches many movies . i just love 80 's movies and since this movie had good reviews , i had to watch it . i was so dissapointed with the nerd and the rebel 's bad acting in the movie ; it was just horrible ! i like the storyline and the soundtrack , but the acting really ruined everything . if you just want to watch it to see some skin and not for good quality acting , then this is your movie
