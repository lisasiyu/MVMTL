terrible this movie was terrible ... .i went into the theater skepical because i heard that the screenwriters were untested ... well , this disastorpiece is what you get as a result . the movie did so poorly that it bankrupted square pictures . the dialouge was filled with one liners , wasted several talented actors like donald sutherland . the drama seemed artificial , and the story was just bad . what i did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by pixar ( monsters inc ... .which was actually far better than this ) this movie is just bad ... .avoid it ... i want to see them make a movie out of final fantasy 6 , which was the best of the series in my opinio
