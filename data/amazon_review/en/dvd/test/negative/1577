edward d wood jr. could make a better film $ 120 million this cost $ 120 million witw ? ? ? volcano is an absurd r list movie story that somehow got an a list budget and a list cast to star in it . the pitiful attempt to make a disaster movie is just a horrifying waste of talent and money . i wish this were a comedy instead of a serious movie ; it 's one of the funniest things i 've seen all year . where are mike , crow and tom servo when you need them ? this is an mst3k movie if there ever was one . to make volcano 's boring predictable story a chimpanzee probably took the copies of screenplays of other bad disaster movies , cut out the worst scenes and then pasted them together to make the script for this movie . if there are people stupid enough to write this stuff up for real ; i do n't want to know about them . you must only need a room temperature iq to be a screenwriter and make the big bucks . schoolteachers who put in 12-15 hour days struggle to make a living and the writer of this screenplay drives a bentley . shows you how fair life is . according to this movie , there 's a live volcano in the middle of los angeles . fault lines the seismologists know about , but somehow they miss a volcano in the middle of an entire city . holding this wafer thin plot together are the cardstock disaster movie cliché characters who spout cliché lines . tommy lee jones ( fresh off his oscar win , shows you how many good roles those worthless gold statues get you . ) is an overworked los angeles fireman who wants to just go on vacation when the catastrophe starts . yeah , there is one of these guys in every one of these disaster movies . the dialogue spouted in this movie will have you in stitches . every line is a ridiculous cliché and sounds extremely ridiculous . oh yeah anne hecht is the blonde pretty geologist who knows all about volcanoes and schools the audience . she also has an interest in tommy lee . don cheadle is the guy who sits in an office and banters with jones over the radio . there 's the teenage daughter who constantly is getting herself in the path of danger . keith david is the cop who does get to go outside and bark orders . this film is a laugh riot . badly computer generated lava threatens to destroy all those beautiful california landmarks . in one scene a guy is walking down a hot tunnel and his nikes are melting ; the poor guy gets engulfed in hundred thousand-degree lava and does n't scream in agonizing pain . he 's making a noble sacrifice saving lives . everything leads up to the demolition of a brand-new office tower to cap the flow of the volcano . tommy lee jones goes to save the teenage girl from a collapsing building , that 's underneath the lava and comes out alive . at the end of the movie enjoy the `` volcanic ash '' that snows down in sunny california makes everyone look the same . bleech . i read somewhere the studio spent $ 120 million on to make this dreck . instead of spending all that money to make this movie , they should have paid the screenwriter twice that much to disappear and buried this screenplay deep under the la brea tar pits so it could never be made into a movie . but hiding this vile story there would probably lead to the tar pits vomiting up lava in the middle of la . just like the movie . i 've seen my share of bad movies and over the past ten years hollywood somehow continues to make films worse than edward d. wood jr could ever think of putting on celluloid in his lifetime . plan 9 from outer space and glen or glenda had a more cohesive plot and better acting than volcano . unless you 're looking for a movie to roast at your mst3k party at your house avoid this on-screen disaster .
