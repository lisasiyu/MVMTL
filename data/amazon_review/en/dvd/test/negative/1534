horrible audio ! i could not really enjoy the film . i purchased it recently on vhs and the audio quality was horrendous . i do n't think anything was ever done to remaster the audio , and it is very annoying to follow . do n't waste $ 19.95 on it . watch it on tcm ; even there the audio is distorted . i only got it because it is a very early irene dunne movie , and i was curious to watch it
