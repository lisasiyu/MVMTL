the mean streets of sweden ... i 'm not sure what i 'm supposed to be expecting from a `` classic eploitation/revenge '' film , but if this is it i 'd say the genre died a just death . as many reviewers have pointed out , there are simply fatal problems with this film . the sex scenes are utterly awful , like they are from an instructional film . christina lindberg is beautiful , but do n't expect any thrills from her outside of some decent lesbian scenes . the lack of music and sound create a claustrophobic feel , but with this kind of film i can never tell if that 's intentional or just the result of piss-poor production values . the `` action '' scenes are almost all in slow-motion which is simply too slow and robs the scenes of any sense of real violence . i do n't know why people go for this kind of movie . i think tarentino has some sort of complex : he feels guilty for using the kind of production values he does , while the movies he grew up on looked and sounded like this one . he should get over it though , there 's nothing wrong with a movie that looks and sounds good , and does n't make you feel akward while you watch it . there 's little `` rough '' or `` shocking '' in this movie , its just not very well done . it 's interesting as a period piece , and its cool that i have a limited edition ( though it is not numbered as other reviewers have pointed out ) , do n't think of this as an investment though , in a few more years , no one 's going to care ...
