highly disappointing , definitely not for everyone the trouble with this dvd is that it is too fast , too brief and with no real outline of pilates for 'everyone ' as the title implies . this is a reasonable pilates work out for those who have done pilates in the past and want to try something new . however i found the conduct of each exercise too fast for me . i like to do my pilates slowly , and each exercise seems to be dynamic rather than some done quite slowly . there is little variation for beginnners who want to do simpler easier exercises . there was some brief discussion from austin about alternatives , but it is all done during the exercises , so it is of little use . it is definitely not for beginners either as it has no real discussion of how to hold yourself in the core , and anchor yourself to the floor . it is definitely a quick once over . i enjoyed some variation on the routine which she offers in this , but it is not recommended for the beginner as a starter to pilates . there are some very good books which can get your started , i loved brooke siler 's book which gave an excellent discussion of how to achieve the core exercises and alternatives .
