maximum overdrive seems stuck in reverse ! among stephen king 's famous quotes is the one about why he does n't direct his own films . his answer , not surprisingly , is , `` have you ever seen 'maximum overdrive ' '' ? that just about says it all . the film has terrific material to work with , but it is static and very poorly executed . when i watch this film i always think , `` why did n't he do this or that ? '' and `` why are all the actors just standing around '' ? fortunately , king is a better writer than director . impressions of a younger king fan : my teenage daughter has read most of king 's novels and agrees with king 's assessment of this film . her favorite film is `` creepshow '' which i introduced to her when she was too young and scared her with the famous line , `` where 's my cake ? '' that line still works . better stephen king films to watch : to see better cinematic examples of stephen king 's storywriting , check out `` the shining '' , `` misery '' , `` creepshow '' or `` carrie '' . none of these films was directed by king , but each film better represents king 's work on the big screen . in `` creepshow '' he even stars in one of the sequences `` the death of jordy verrill '' , and he does a respectable job of interpreting his own work . out of fairness : there are worse films out there , but stephen king did not write the novels or screenplays for them . this film , though not a good representation of king 's work , is watchable for some and is not terrible . unlike many of king 's other films , this can not be classified as good , however
