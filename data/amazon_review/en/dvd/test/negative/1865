not for improvement ... this dvd is not an instructional dvd . you wo n't learn anything with it . there is few tabs of riffs that flea is playing in it , but they realy are no use ... this dvd is fun if you would like to see flea when he was younger and if you like this guy . this inverviewer is boring and looks like he will fall asleep any minute ... if you want to improve your playing , purchase something else . if you wa n't to have a good laugh and look some cool jamming that you wo n't learn to play , this might be for you..
