old action heroes do n't die , they just fade away . instructions : rent steven seagall 's latest action movie knuckle-fest `` exit wounds '' . insert in dvd player ; watch first 15 minutes of movie , remove from dvd player . return to video store . if you follow those instructions to the letter , you 'll have fun with `` exit wounds '' , which features one of the best opening sequences of any action movie in recent memory ( seagall attempts to thwart a brash , brazen assassination attempt ) . there 's also a great scene -- -strike that , a priceless scene : hipster uber-villain ( played convincingly by rapper dmx ) and a henchman go on a shopping spree in an exotic car lot ( ultimately settling on a lamborghini murcielago , paid for in cash out of a golf bag ) . the scene is dope , def , and cool -- -it 's all good , dawgz ! -- -- , in a new jack city way . and that 's a shame , really : it 's so cool it just makes you grind your teeth as you begin , over the course of two hours , to realize that the rest of the movie just ca n't hold a candle to its opening minutes . an action movie should be exciting ; after seagall foils a neatly organized assassination attempt on the u.s. vice president ( a brilliant little sequence which merits one star on its own , and from which 95 % of the trailer material was taken ) , `` exit wounds '' is not exciting . it 's stale . it 's rehashed . honestly , were it not for dmx , the few riffs from the movie 's excellent rap soundtrack , and the equipment , i would have thought i was watching an eighties seagall flick . and that 's surprising , given that the movie is helmed by `` romeo must die '' director andrzej bartkowiak , who also did the cinematography for speed , lethal weapon 4 , and devil 's advocate . the plot , what there is of it , deals with police corruption , and features a major twist near the end that takes the punch out of the story and does n't make any sense -- -but by that time you 've stopped caring . you 've seen all of this before -- -done better . worst of all , seagall is just too old to be a credible action hero ; he 's reached that wheezing , shortness of breath stage that afflicted roger moore back in `` view to a kill '' -- -except seagall does n't have the acting chops that moore was able to fall back on . tom arnold is thrown in for laughs , but the laughs are so feeble , and the jokes so stale , that you 're laughing *at* arnold and seagall -- -not with them . midway through `` exit wounds '' i was fighting to stay awake , and that 's a shame , given that the first 15 minutes of the movie contained more sheer , hectic energy than any movie i 've seen since `` face/off '' . rent the dvd for that opener if you dare , but if you stay any longer you 'll see it 's true : old action heroes never die , they just fade away . js
