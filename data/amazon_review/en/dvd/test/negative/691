amazingly bad -- - do n't buy it , do n't even rent it ! this film is unwatchable -- and the only question is what talented actors like colin firth and minnie driver are doing in this insipid hack job . when it comes to dialogue , not a single word rings true . none of the characters make any sense at all . they are reading lines and getting into situations that are so dull , and so ridiculously unbelievable , that one wonders if the film were written by a group of typing monkeys who happened to hit letters that formed words , rather than a cognizant human being . we could n't get through it , as it was clearly outside the realm of possibility that the clueless writer-director could ever have his characters do anything that anyone else on the planet would care about . i see that view validated by the other reviewers with more persistence who watched this thing until the end . it 's amazing he ever got funding for this ultimate turkey
