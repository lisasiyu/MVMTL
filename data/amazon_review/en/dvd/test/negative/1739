deficient erotic thriller sequel without connection to predecessor ... the original film 8 mm deals with the theme of why people commit horrendous acts of violence , as it deals with an 8mm film that contains a real murder . these films have been dubbed snuff films . director alejandro amenábar even makes a better story of his terrific thriller called thesis ( 1996 ) that portrays a female college student studying violence in media who also comes across a snuff film . thus , when a title comes out with the name 8mm 2 , the audience will make the logical deduction that it will also deal with a theme of why people commit vile murderous acts on film . in addition , to set the film in east europe enhances this notion of brutal violence , as many films and news updates contain dreadful crimes in eastern europe that have links with organized crime . thus , the implications of another tense and suspenseful cinematic event is set to bring viewers down the horror lane . however , it would be complete miscalculation by the audience to make the inference that the sequel would follow the same theme . here in 8mm 2 , which does not even have any of the same actors , director , or theme , merely applies the title of a successful film in order to attract viewers . the film tries to evoke a similar atmosphere of depravity and immorality among the upper class , as joel schumacher 's 8mm . it succeeds to some extent , but does not have the same grim and dark touch . 8mm 2 opens with a shot of a courtroom where a number of people are talking while the sound of a passionately active couple sexually pleasure one another . here the story advertises the film 's path , as david ( johnathon schaech ) tells his fiancé , tish ( lori heuring ) , about a sexual fantasy of his . they are on their way to a weekend vacation at a luxurious hotel where they intend to bathe each other in sinful lust , which enhances when tish invites a woman to join them after a nightclub visit . together they end up in a ménage à trios that they never are going to forget . after the return from their wicked vacation , there are obviously some tense emotions underneath the surface . it bears the same sentiments that threesome ( 1994 ) portrayed through three sexually experimenting college students . however , the emotional turmoil quickly evaporates when david receives an envelop with pictures of tish , david , and the girl that they met in the club . due to tish 's father 's political position as an ambassador in hungary and a potential candidate for the supreme court nominee and david 's future in politics they can not approach law enforcement . it leaves them dealing with the criminals themselves , which brings them on a journey into the budapest red light district and the world of pornography . the film provides a futile attempt to make it a political thriller , but this too fails . instead , it provides an erotic thriller with non-existent suspense , but much erotica . in some aspects , the film will remind the audience about wild things ( 1998 ) , but there is far more sexuality present in 8mm 2 . the film tries to hide a poor story underneath the world of sex while dealing with a rather amusingly silly extortion affair . in addition , tish and david also seem completely oblivious in regards to the threats that the underworld could pose on them if the criminal elements so desired . the many awkward moments within the film outweigh everything else , and leave the viewers with a hollow and empty cinematic experience . 8mm 2 was a rather disappointing film , as it had nothing to do with the original film with nicolas cage , and the story was a clichéd combination between wild things and an adult film . the question is whether the audience is better of with the latter , as the story does not capture the audience 's attention in regards to suspense , or drama
