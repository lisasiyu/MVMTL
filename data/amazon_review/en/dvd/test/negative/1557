its official - brad pitt can not act ive read reviews for this piece of schlock calling it a `` cult classic '' ( isnt that what they always call crappy movies that only stoned college kids can watch ? ) or `` underated '' ( theres a reason it was underated -it sucks ) . brad pitts performance was laughable . watch any episode of gunsmoke and tell me early grace wasnt a bad impersonation of festus from start to finish . and that guy from the x files , david sumthin or other , mumbles in this annoying monotone throughout the whole film . this guy adds about as much to the movie as those ads for the concession stand.and juliet lewis playing a yet another brain dead bimbo . who woulda saw that one coming ? ? ? the only reason i gave this one 2 stars is its so bad it just kept me on the edge of my seat . i think its called `` morbid fascination '' , like when you stop to gawk at a really bad traffic accident - it repulses you but you just cant turn away . if you want my advice ( and you probably dont ) take the money you were gon na spend on this movie and go buy a gunsmoke dvd . that way you get festus and you get to watch matt dillon beat the h*** outta somebody
