mediocre , at best ! i have read `` into thin air '' and watched the discovery channel series on mt . everest , so i received this dvd with great anticipation . however , my excitement dissolved quickly due to the cheesy music , awful special effects , lack of drama , and poor landscape visuals . i was completely bored . it was a waste of 45 minutes
