one of the worst movies i have ever seen . this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you would n't miss anything and might even enjoy it . unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i could n't wait for it to end . i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was . at least a quarter of them walked out before the end . it 's that bad . it 's a shame , i love a good suspense/horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted
