terrible movie ! i just read the divide by the author of the horse whisperer , and i wanted to share my opinion of the horse whisperer . i did not read the book ; i saw the movie , a couple of years ago . i just remember it being very hoakie , one of the worst movies i had ever seen . i know that it drew some critical acclaim and that it was popular with the public , but i did not share this enthusiasm . do n't waste your time on this ridiculous movie
