zhang yimou rating - 5 stars for the film , of course , but zero stars for the copy . thank you so much for the information on the new editions of ju dou , qui ju . ( razor ) . i have cancelled my order . i will keep reading your commments and continue my search for these films ( red sorgum also ) . and will let you know if i find anything . thanks to amazon for letting us give and receive helpful opinions . looking for excellent copies of red lanterns ( allright edition ) , to live ( mgn ) , and shanghai triad ( shanghai film studio ) ? you can get them in france at www . fnac.com . they are about 20 euros each which is about 17 $ . of course you will have to pay postage , and perhaps customs , but they are worth it . from new copies and brilliant colors . only to live has english sub titles . all three have french subtitles . you also will need a dvd player which can read zone2 disques . fosses-st-b
