... you had me at goodbye ... ... this movie is at the top of my list ... unfortunately , it 's the 'worst movie of all-time ' list ... that 's right , ladies and gentlemen , friends and supporters of this film ... this movie is trash ( and not just for cuba 's horribly annoying acting ) ... it 's also one of the reasons so many relationships end up miserable ... come on ... do you really think renee would have ended up with this guy if his career went in the other direction ... it was pure desperation rather than inspiration that made him succumb to showing up with his hat in his hands ... and if all you base a relationship on , is the end justifying the means , well , i wish you luck with your next soul mate..
