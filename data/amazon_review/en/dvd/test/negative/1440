he 's no robert redford after reading the novel the great gatsby for school i went out and rented the 1974 version of the movie . i absolutely adored it . it showed the characters personalities as they were in the book . after that we watched the 2001 version in school and i found it to be almost unbearable . the acting was poor exspecially on the part of toby stephens ( gatsby ) . he seemed like more of a mix of joey from friends and boy george than a love struck man . while the hit and run scene did prove to be rather entertaining , over all i feel that this movie is just a waste of time and you would be much better off watching the 1974 version
