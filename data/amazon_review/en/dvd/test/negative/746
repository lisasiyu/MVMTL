laney boggs was robbed ... i first saw this movie in high school-i believe i was a senior-and i remember thinking , `` high school is not like this at all ! '' throughout the whole movie . now , i do understand that this is a fictional movie and therefore it is set in a fictional world , where anything is possible ( except laney boggs becoming prom queen of course ) , but i felt like this movie was so far out into la la land with it 's premise and execution that it was hard to really relate or like any of the characters in the movie . first of all , why do movies always have to over-exagerate the bitchiness of a prom queen ? ? ? in my school , the homecoming court and prom court were chock full of nice , friendly kids , and the ones who took home the crowns were voted on because of there personalities , not because they were hot like taylor vaugh or whatever her name was . i hate that stereotype because it does n't relate to any school-at least any school in the midwest ! also , what was so terribly heinous about rachel lee cook that they would pick her over any other girl in the school-so what if she wore ugly clothes and had big glasses-the girl has a killer face and a tiny little body ... her only flaw was her love for being a loner . freddy prinze jr. was at his peak in this movie though-he seems to have gone wayyyyyyy downhill since this movie was released . the best part about this movie is the cheesy makeover sequence when laney walks down the stairs to sixpence none the richer 's song kiss me . the biggest let down of this movie to me though was that taylor won prom queen over laney . seriously , that still pisses me off to this day . the ending was just a complete and utter bomb ... i wanted that skank taylor to lose and cry or get totally laughed at or at least have had some minor bad thing happen to her . she was just a horrible , snotty witch and nothing bad seemed to happen to her . oh well , this movie is pretty lame ... i will always remember it though because i saw it in the theater with three of my close friends our senior year . cheesy movie ... laney boggs was robbed ! !
