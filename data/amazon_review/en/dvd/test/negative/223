my advice , watch 'get shorty ' instead the problem with this film is i read the book . i was disappointed simply because `be cool ' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent . the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example . somewhere the bulk of the story was lost -- and there are some very -- very good characters appearing in the film that would 've been more intersing if somebody would 've said , `` hey , do n't forget the book ! '' but being true to the original source is not hollywood 's strong suit . `` be cool '' provides some popular music , some known faces , but without john travolta , the movie would never have been made . a few laughs are provided . a couple ironic scenes show up , but there 's too little to sustain a full-length feature . basically , the project is a disservice to everyone involved . some of the characters are so thin -- face it -- poor christina milian as linda moon , is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings -- a clichï¿½ . the rock does the best he can but again , `he 's a gay bodyguard ; ' he 's the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji , his boss [ vince vaughn ] , who , in the book , is far more sinister -- but in the film he 's an idiot . of course chili is chili . travolta does a very nice job , and chili 's obviously the smartest guy in the room . uma thruman 's performance is , well , not funny -- not serious , not intense -- not much -- at best , she made me shrug . i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr , but there 's just not enough , and all the negatives reflect completely on the director . enough said there . my advice , watch `get shorty'again , or read `be cool .
