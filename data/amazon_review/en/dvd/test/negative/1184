2.5 stars alright . so i had intended to see this movie upon its release way back and just really never got to it . a week or so ago it was playing on oprah 's oxygen network and i was very happy that i would finally be able to see it . overall , it was alright . so then it was on again the next day and i could n't stomach watching it again . it may be called brown sugar , but the plot moves slower than molasses . it is way too predictable and sweet , with very little substance . it was n't even all too interseting the first time around and i could n't stand seeing it a second time . there 's a reason why these movies are on tv , people . no need to purchase the dvd . as soon as i saw it once , i had gotten my dose and wanted no more
