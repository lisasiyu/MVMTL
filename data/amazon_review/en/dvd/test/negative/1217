hugely disappointed . . . . maybe it was just me , but this concert dvd is a major disappointment ! it 's quite surprising to see how little ( if any ) connection madonna makes with the audience . shorn of her locks , her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here . perhaps it 's a result of her having become larger than life ( ala striesand , whitney houston , etc. ) . despite all the razzle-dazzle here , examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound . songs like `` vogue '' and `` express yourself '' should have been rousing stompers . instead , they are overstylized , choreographed to the max and perfunctory ( the effect is like watching a canned tv award show performance ) . worst of all is her ill-conceived `` like a virgin . '' i can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom , but `` virgin '' recast as 1940 's marlene dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch ( complete with unisex tuxedo , top hat and faux-german accent ) ? ? ? ? this is a shocking lapse in judgment -- and boring to boot ! ! ! the only sign of life comes near the end , with the lock-step performance of `` holiday , '' which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching-band romp . here , she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi-length military-style coats ! one look at this performance and you ca n't help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff . no one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow , but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for . i 'm willing to give madonna one more shot and pick up the blond ambition dvd when or if it becomes available . until then , my best advice is to check out dvds featuring the likes of tina turner , donna summer or even sade -- they all prove that you can make the old new again , share and reveal something that a studio production ca n't , and thus never need to worry about going stale . real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp -- it 's audience connection !
