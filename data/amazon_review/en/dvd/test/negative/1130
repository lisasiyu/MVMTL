read between the lines if you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews , you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good ( not great ) acting . jessica lange basically does an impression of marilyn monroe with a southern accent . well not all of the time , since her accent seems to come and go . the amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has . skip it unless you really , really , really love jessica lange . by the way , if this movie is set in the early sixties , why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall ? this is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend ! puh-lease
