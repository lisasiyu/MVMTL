its ok but i gave it away although i love the firm , this one is not my favorite.it is a good workout , there is just something about it ... it drags.perhaps ms delrio is not quite as toned as one would hope..i do n't know.at one point she has her eyes shut while she squats.i have dozens of firms and some with this instructor , that i like.it seems that most firm videos have a way of tricking you into working out hard before you know it , but this one falls short in some indescribable way
