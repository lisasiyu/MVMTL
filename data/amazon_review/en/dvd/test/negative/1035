not even worth illegally downloading ! ! ! holy moley . this thing sucked rancid twinkies through a hot garden hose . even *if* you could get past the editing , there 's the lighting . even *if* you could get past the lighting , there 's the problem with the audio being disastrously out of sync with the video ( even in the first scene , when the flute player did n't even come close to keying with the notes ... and on and on and on ) . even *if* you got past the editing , lighting , and sync problems , you 're still left with a bizarre egomaniac throwing himself around on stage . no matter how good you think he is ( and i do agree he 's quite talented ) it 's obvious that flatley thinks he 's even better . at the expense of the story , the cohesion , and at the expense of the viewers enjoyment , he 's out to show how awesome he is . which tells me that other than dancing , he does n't have a lot going for him . he kind of reminds me of mighty mouse ... chest puffed out ... `` here i come to save the dayyyyyy ! ! ! '' i 'll tell you what to save ... save your money , put it as the very very last item on your internet dvd rental queue , and hope you never get to it
