another gay hiv+ demon infects another innocent wife ( yawn ) intensely homophobic , heterosexist , and hateful , this film represents the twisted fears and logic of the early panic stage of the disease in the 1980s . it was a time when the public was eager to pin the epidemic squarely on the shoulders of gay men , blaming antisocial `` aids carriers '' for carelessly or intentionally infecting chaste wives and innocent babies . it was a time when the public blamed aids on lust-driven , irresponsible gay men and cheating husbands . the film is pretentious and overbearing in its failed attempt to masquerade as a sophisticated inquiry into moral responsibility in the age of hiv . it reinforces the simplistic outdated idea that those who are infected with hiv can be neatly separated into the categories of `` deserving '' or `` undeserving '' - immoral monsters and their innocent victims sitting together on death row . twenty years ago , perhaps this film would have its place as a document reflecting our social ignorance and failures in coping with a new epidemic . we did not know then that hiv was a predominantly heterosexual global pandemic . today this film is a sophomoric attempt to assign blame and reinforce old prejudices about hiv and hiv+ people . most importantly , hiv is no longer a death sentence to americans who discover their status and enter medical treatment early . as someone who counsels and tests hundreds of people for hiv infection every year , i would not recommend this film to anyone seeking knowledge or entertainment
