a poorly edited documentary ; story misses the mark i agree with the two other negative reviews here and am surprised there are n't more dissenting opinions . this movie made me feel embarrassed for the people in it . the topic would seem to have a lot of potential but the folks who are featured are repulsive and there is not enough in-depth exploration of the art to make it interesting . the story rambled , and the americans ( yes , that includes paul pena ) behaved so awkwardly it was painful to watch . there was just a low-level vulgar tone throughout the whole movie . in many scenes , paul totes a beer and looks like an indigent . he comes across as pathetic , socially tone deaf , and totally unworthy of his own talent . mario was a boor - always coming up with something obnoxious , loud , and totally irrelevant to say . ( why the hell he was invited on the trip is a mystery . ) the filmakers did a poor job of setting up the story and getting me to care about it or anyone in it . do n't bother with this one .
