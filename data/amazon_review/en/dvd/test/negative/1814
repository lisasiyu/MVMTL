i 've had 1080p t2 for 3 years . there 's no need to buy this expensive version . back in 2003 t2 extreme was released which was an excellent version of the movie . not only did it have excellent extra features , but it had the extended version which is wonderful , and a 1080p version of the original theatrical version ( i.e . this one being reviewed ) playable via home computer . now , at the time the requirements were quite steep in order to view the movie , but to todays computer standards it is minimal . i watched the blu ray version at a friends house , brought over my t2 extreme edition , played it on his computer next to the hdtv , and compared the two . there was hardly any difference and if there was the hat went off to the computer version . why do i mention this ? because this blu ray is over priced and has nothing for extras . you want the best version of t2 you can buy ? then walk yourself down to a local wal-mart and go to the $ 7.00 dvd rack and pick up terminator 2 : extreme edition . you 'll want to shoot yourself if you do n't do it . heck , by 4 of them for the same price as one blu ray version ! there 's your christmas presents ! !
