bad quality dvd the video in this dvd looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a dvd disc . a standard 4.7gb disc , by the way ; that 's what you 'll get when you buy this . i say this because i 've used those programs before and know how they alter the video . this is how they alter it , and how it looks on this usa release of the dvd : skin color is too red . dark ( shadowed ) areas are greenish . white/beige is pinkish . grey is bluish . white has blue on it . the colors are just totally messed up . evidence of grey being blue = look at robert duvall 's uniform ( you 'll see him 3 minutes into the movie ) . the german uniform is a semi-light grey . it is too dark and filled with blue . then look behind him at the wall . a lovely dark shadow of green . evidence of white/beige being pinkish , when robert duvall walks into that office , look at the walls . they should be a kind of white/beige color but they are not a shade of white at all , they are pinkish . as he walks into the office to sit down , you see curtains on the wall in the office . they are supposed to be white , but they 're filled with blue . at 48 minutes into the movie , you see donald sutherland sitting in the grass with the character molly . his suit is supposed to be black . look at it . it 's purple . that is not black . on top of all that , the movie is too dark . there should have been a brightness/contrast adjustment . if you pay attention to dark areas in the movie , such as fixtures around a room or an office , most times , they are pitch black and indistinguished . for example , look at desk drawers , telephones , vases , black hair , black jackets..even robert duvall 's eye patch . not much shading , usually pitch black . i 've read that this movie apparently was not remastered for the north american release . i plan to get the region 2 ( europe ) release . i 'd rather do without watching it on my tv and watch it on my computer in better , `` proper '' quality .
