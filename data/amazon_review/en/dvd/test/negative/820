karl rove would be proud so i finally got around to watching `` michael moore hates america '' , the dvd that was financed by richard mellon scaife , with the help of a few right-wing think tanks . also appearing is penn jillette , a rabid psychiatrist , some nra staffers , pundits , more think-tankers , and a number of pissed-off vets . while wilson comes off as tolerant ( backhandedly ) with regards to moore 's techniques , when it comes to his ideas it 's almost completely one-sided in that that nearly everything is a rebuttal of the man 's social commentary . there 's a lot of well-balanced , average centrist people that get innocently sucked into this mess , but the number of instances that hint that maybe , just maybe moore 's got a few points in his films ( as opposed to everything being mere alarmist rhetoric manufactured by taking things out of context ) are exceedingly few . center-right moderates are likely to feel soothed and smug by the whole presentation , so the movie caters to them very well . by far most of the examples criticized here involve bowling for columbine , with only a few from `` roger and me '' and none from `` fahrenheit 911 '' although the movie was released . in one scene wilson attempts to push-poll a woman who saw `` fahrenheit '' the day before : `` how would knowing that mr. moore 's selective editing of the facts in fahrenheit in order to support false conclusions affect your enjoyment of the film ? '' on a social level , the film is a veritable ode to republican framing , i.e . : there is no economic divide , corporations do n't hurt us , we can all be successful if we work hard enough , criticizing the leadership means you hate america , etc. , etc ... and oh yeah , one actually guy goes on to say that we do n't need michael moore because we already get fair perspectives on all sides from the major news media , amazingly lumping present-day fox , cnn and pre-merger cbs-era walter cronkite together in the same sentence . ultimately , the man ( michael wilson ) fails to get his interview .
