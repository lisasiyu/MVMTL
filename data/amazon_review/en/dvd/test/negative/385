rosemary 's baby ... in spaaaaaaace ! johnny depp is my wife 's favorite actor , so she bought the astronaut 's wife from a bargain dvd bin when she saw his face on the cover . the plot 's a little garbled , but it goes something like this : capt . alex streck ( nick cassavettes ) and commander spence armacost ( johnny depp ) go off on a space mission . when they come back , they 're different . some kind of weird sound -- it sounds like shrieking static -- was beamed into their bodies . what it is , exactly , we 're not sure . let 's call it `` a possessing entity . '' this malevolent entity wants to have children . twins , to be precise . so spence becomes fixated on 1 ) molesting his wife jillian ( charlize theron ) , and 2 ) building a spacecraft for two pilots . and then jillian finds out she 's pregnant ! and soon , streck dies of a seizure and his wife natalie ( donna murphy ) commits suicide with a toaster ! and it turns out she was pregnant ... with twins ! scary stuff , right ? well , no . it 's not scary . in fact , the film lingers and drags . struggling to inject some urgency is the frenetic sherman reese ( joe morton ) . sherman is convinced something is wrong . he goes about it all the wrong way , of course , babbling on about aliens from outer space , harassing poor jillian , and basically ensuring that he 's a one note character , not an actually developed person . this movie is a blatant rip-off ( or homage , if you think it 's good ) of rosemary 's baby . this explains theron 's pageboy haircut , but does n't excuse anything else . the battle of wills between husband and wife is really a battle of viewer 's patience . will she escape her husband ? will jillian abort the children ? does anyone care ? it 's hard to care . for much of the film , we 're not entirely convinced that there 's anything actually wrong with spence . he seems genuinely concerned with his wife ; if the movie had bothered to keep us guessing , this would have made for an interesting twist ( maybe she was crazy all along ! ) . but it devolves pretty quickly . there 's lots of sexual symbolism , and not the good kind . yes folks , this is the first film i 've ever seen that seriously showed a subway train entering a tunnel overlapped with depp 's `` oh '' face ( fans of office space will know what i mean ) . is that symbolism or what ? finally , depp has affected a southern accent for no discernable reason . it turns into something of a vague mumble and he shifts in and out of it ( especially when angry ) , such that we 're not sure if spence really ever had an accent . would n't it have been cool if the accent disappeared when the alien possessed him ? yeah , that would have been neat movie . rosemary 's baby was very much a product of its time . the astronaut 's wife has all the pretty people and slick special effects , but never really bothers to reinforce the sinister nature of the people from beyond . everyone gets that the devil is evil incarnate and that you do n't want to have his baby . the astronaut 's wife never actually proves that the aliens are bad ... jillian 's twins could go on to create world peace for all we know . fortunately , depp and theron would go on to do much better works . alas , the astronaut 's wife serves as a reminder that you ca n't just swap out religion with aliens and assume it will be a great movie
