soundtrack ruined it oh man , this movie was so hard for me to stay interested in . the story had potential to make a adequate drama/thriller , if only it had been directed right . a lot of times you hear people say , such and such movie `` took itself way too seriously . '' well in this case i do n't think this movie took itself seriously enough . i felt detached from the movie the instant my ear drums vibrated as that ridiculous soundtrack made way into my head . every moment where it had the chance to build a little bit of tension , this goofy music would kick in , or a wacky looney tunes type sound effect would `` boing , '' or do something similarly zany , totally leaving me uninterested . i do n't understand why they would go for that type of comical atmosphere with a story like this . it 's not like the story itself was clever enough to be able to pull off being told in such a manner . the tone of the movie and the tone of the soundtrack conflicted with each other , not a good thing . the one part of the soundtrack i did like was the hollow , ambient type of music they played in many of those desert scenes , that created a good mood i thought . a random point- remember the scene where jennifer lopez almost got pushed off the cliff ? ask yourself , would a normal person react that calmly , or make such a quick witty comment about their situation , when their life hangs in the balance ?
