terrible i could not sit through this movie . the acting and screenplay are terrible . this film could be described as a bad made-for-tv movie at best . i ended up fast-forwarding though the entire movie after the first 30 minutes and turned the player off before i reached the end . i could n't take it anymore . this movie is one of the worst i 've attempted to watch in a long time . not recommended .
