fantastic musical scores , acting production good but uneven and busy musical scores were on spot , rich and compelling , imparting emotional punch ! chemistry was somewhat skewed between kidman and enman . the rule of `` show do n't tell '' was broken periodically throughout dialogue , particuarly in enman 's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene `` announcing '' to each one he meets he 's in love . scenes were pleasantly varied , many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters , however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained . it seems as though this movie tried to do `` too much '' and as a result the plot became vexed with business . a cornicopia of scene effects , ranging from surreal , to tragic , to tongue in cheek , to implausible ( with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre ? ) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest , although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks . speaking of implausible - the friendship that ensued between the red-haired minister and enman , in light of their initial conflict , seemed rather far fetched and silly , moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times . renee ' zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in jerry macguire . nicole kidman was not in her element , yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present . this film was over-starred and substantially miscast . did n't need donald as kidman 's father and kidman and zellwegger 's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary . overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault . undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved .
