am i missing something ? i ca n't believe how many people think this movie is a masterpiece . i had such high expectations of it and was extremely disappointed . when the film began i was interested for about 20 minutes , but then as it went on i started to have doubts . after a while i was debating whether or not to turn it off , but towards the end i decided to leave it on just to see how bad it was actually going to get . and it really did get bad ! the ending was so predictible and hackneyed . it was just another crappy cops and robbers story , but with a high budget and an all-star cast
