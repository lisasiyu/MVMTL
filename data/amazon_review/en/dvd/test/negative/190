shallow this production is okay -- not a complete waste of time , but not great either . overall , the script is a very shallow translation of the book , particularly regarding jane fairfax and frank churchill . though ewan mcgregor is pretty forgettable as frank churchill ( partly because of the script ) , and toni collette seems to be less harriet smith and more forrest gump at some points , there are still some excellent performances . gwyneth paltrow does well with the material ( such as it is ) , and she works well with jeremy northam ( mr. knightly ) . i especially enjoyed juliet stevenson as mrs. elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of phyllida law and sophie thompson as mrs. and miss bates . overall , this production looks pretty , but it 's austen for the masses . people who enjoy watching movies with a historical feel and are n't particular about literary sources will probably enjoy it . for the rest of us , i recommend the production of emma staring kate beckinsdale .
