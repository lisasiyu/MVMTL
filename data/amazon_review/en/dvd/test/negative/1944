worst movie ever ... voice sounds like he has cancer ! this was the worst seagal movie ever made ... it was confusing , dark , stupid plot and they made his voice sound like the marlboro man with cancer . i used to love his movies but if this is the stuff he is now making he is all washed up . he fights like a old man in the movie too ... dont waste your time or money ... too bad ... he used to be great
