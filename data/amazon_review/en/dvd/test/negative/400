poor transfer , paging criterion since we know there is another version of `` burn '' out there , i would suggest you wait for it and check rotten tomatoes.com and get an idea of its quality.you can not judge the quality of this film by the pan and scan , poorly coordinated color transfer that sony has issued.brando told larry king it was his favorite film ; not if he saw this package
