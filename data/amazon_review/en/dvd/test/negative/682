wish wish wish never bought this dvd i tried the abs workout and because it 's twisting you in a weird way , i injured my tail bone . that was in february of 2004 . since then , to this day i have pain ( similar to arthritis ) in my tailbone that gets aggravated from various activities , so i have to really watch out . i have better days and worse days . once it does get aggravated , i 'm doomed for weeks till it calms down . it 's so annoying since i 'm only 31 and it hurts right now even when i 'm walking ( i feel like i 'm 71 ) i wish i had never come across this dvd ! ! !
