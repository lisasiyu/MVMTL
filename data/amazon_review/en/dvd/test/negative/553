amazon.com likes to take my money this is another story that i do n't know if i like it or not because amazon.com never sent it too me . this has happened about 4/5 times . while usually i have no problem getting movies , sometimes i do . sending them e-mails does n't seem to work . if they did n't have the best prices for movies , i 'd leave
