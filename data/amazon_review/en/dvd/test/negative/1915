has enough blood to gag a vampire brief plot summary : two low life hoods kidnap a pregnant surrogate mother . her baby 's `` father '' ( sort of ) turns out to be a mob boss ( or has mob connections ) , said mob boss whistles up his goons , they go after the hoods , and then a lot of people die . if you like watching characters for whom you care nothing about get slaughtered in bloody gun fights , this film is for you . you do n't have to worry about a plot or being required to use your brain , just sit back and watch the mayhem . speaking for myself , the first 10 minutes of guttermouth verbal abuse directed at del torro and his pal by the woman he ended up punching out was more than enough for me , but unfortunately , the friends i was with wanted to see the whole thing , and i had to sit through the whole thing to the very bloody end . so , in summary , way of the gun is just a pulp fiction wannabe put together by some quentin tarrantino wannabe and you could do a lot better for an evening 's home viewing . if gritty violence is what you like , and feasable plots are optional , narc with jason patrick ( one of hollywood 's better stars and one of the least appreciated ) and ray liotta is a far more masterful piece of film than the sophmoric way of the gun
