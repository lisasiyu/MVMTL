collateral it 's amazing just how quickly i decided this movie really sucks . a music video without the music ! for the usa today , mtv , no attention span generation ! with exclamation points ! however , just to be fair and because i had nothing better to do , i endured 20 minutes . give me a medal ! tom cruise looks better with mustache , beard , gray hair . jamie foxx 's talents are wasted here . it 's writing like this that makes us realize that aaron spelling was much better than we gave him credit for .
