would have been better had they not called it dnd basically i 'm a fan of b-movie fantasy films as well as a long time dnd player . i can say that the movie by itself is really not that bad and i 'd easily say that its not the worst b-grade fantasy film ever made . however as a dnd movie it blows . i 'll never understand the need of filmakers to make a film based on something with a strong fan base and then change everything that the fans love about the subject . i can fully understand the need to change some things . this is a movie and unlike some purists i understand it is a different medium and sometimes things just have to be different . however this film bore almost no resemblance to dnd . fortunately when the sequel ( wrath of the dragon god ) was made this was fixed . basically a good movie just not a good dnd movie . if you can get over that fact go ahead and watch it for the somewhat ok b fantasy movie that it is .
