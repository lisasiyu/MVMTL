`` well , i do n't like this at all ... computers and corpses are a bad mixture . '' i really had little idea the cinematic pain train i was boarding as i watched rats - night of terror ( 1983 ) aka rats - notte di terrore last night . oh sure , i read the reviews and what not , but to really get a true understanding of the film 's utterly rotten essence , you must watch it , and experience it , for yourself . i 've seen a hell of a lot of bad movies in my time , but i have to say , this fetid , moldering bit if italian produced flotsam buried the needle on my suck-o-meter , something that has n't happened since i watched red serpent ( 2002 ) , with michael paré and roy scheider . written and directed by bruno mattei , the man who gave us such wonders as s.s. extermination love camp ( 1977 ) and the ode to the usage of stock footage hell of the living dead ( 1980 ) , the film features ottaviano dell'acqua ( zombi 3 ) , geretta geretta ( demons ) , massimo vanni ( escape from the bronx ) , ann-gisel glass ( deadly eyes ) , henry luciani , and fausto lombardi ( do n't look in the attic ) . the film started off well enough , with some displayed text telling us about how a great , nuclear holocaust drove those humans left alive under the ground , where they developed sophisticated societies . after some years , some ( fool ) hearty individuals decided on returning to the surface , to enjoy the toxic wonderment i suppose , and became viewed as primitives by those who remained down below . the story picks up in the year 225 a.b . ( after the bomb ) as we see a motorcycle gang tooling around the wasteland ( looks like an old rock quarry to me ) . as i was wondering just where in the heck they got the gas to run their machines , they boogie on into a dilapidated city , deciding this might be a good place to set up camp ... and this is about the time the , as the boys from mst3k would say , the `deep hurting ' began as the characters started to actually talk . anyway , the find a deserted research facility , complete with canned food , plants ( fresh vegetables and fruit ) , and fresh water , littered with gnawed on corpses ... well , it 's not completely deserted , as there 's the rats , and plenty of them . they clear out the dead bodies , move into their new digs , and soon enough the mutated , furry , super rodents begin picking off the gang one by one . not only that , but the verminous mongrels have eaten up the tires on the vehicles , preventing those who have n't become all ate up from leaving . as tensions rise , more annoying characters die ( thankfully ) , and leadership of the gang comes into question , but there 's little time for debate as the hairy horde begin their relentless onslaught ( apparently grungy bikers are good eatin ' ... who knew ? ) challenging man 's long standing position on the top of the food chain ... seems pretty straightforward , right ? well , perhaps , but essentially what i did was put a nice sheen on a stanky ( stank goes well beyond stink ) turd , and believe me , that was not an easy task ... really , the absolute worst aspect of this film is the writing . here 's an example , once the rats begin killing off the characters , one woman spits out this little gem of brilliance , `` the idea of being killed right now really frightens me . '' and here 's another , as the leader of the gang prepares to flash fry a whole mess of rats with his flamethrower , `` i 'm going to warm their whiskers . '' oh criminey ... the film is filled with completely unnatural dialog , pointless interactions , accompanied by atrocious , awe inspiringly overblown performances . i swear , the actors chewed up more scenery than the rats themselves . as far as the characters go , a more irritating bunch you 'll rarely see . one ca n't help but root for the voracious rodentia . and get the names of some of these a-holes ... duke , video , lucifer , chocolate ... there was one character that was particularly loathsome in that of myrna , a leather clad woman who spent a great deal of time losing her marbles and screeching incoherently throughout the film . here 's another juicy line of idiocy , as one mook finds a bottle of booze and begins sucking it down ... '' hey , what an incredible drink ! `` ... yeah , drink up boyo , as your time is gon na come . i think the absolute worst scene for me was near the beginning , when the group found all the food and began celebrating by dumping sugar and flour all over each other , dancing about like mental deficients . the black woman , named chocolate ( nice ) , ends up covered in flour , and starts shouting how she 's white , while doing a very loose interpretation of an irish jig . the effects throughout were n't too bad , but mostly featured people off screen either throwing , or dumping rats onto the performers . there were a few gruesome bits , like the rat in the sleeping bag gag , and the exploding corpse piñata filled with rodents , so fans of the visceral will find something to enjoy . now i 've read where some think the awful aspects of the film are intentional in a comedic sense , and even the back of the dvd case makes statements along these lines , but i honestly believe the original intent was to try and make a serious , scary film , and once the finished product was out there , everyone assumed it to be a joke , so mattei went along with this rather than cop to the fact he 's a lousy writer ... .hell , that 's what i would have done , if i were in his italian loafers ... i suppose it does n't make a difference one way or another , as if you 're an aficionado of rotten , sleazy , awful cinema , this one 's right up your alley . as far as the directing , apparently mattei , who started working on this film right after completing a project with jess franco , keeps things moving along , disjointedly , but seems to have thankfully taken few cues from that spanish hack ( seriously , ever seen oasis of the zombies ? if so , you know what i 'm talking about ) . hey , at least there 's a decent nekkid chick in the movie , which is nearly spoiled by a nekkid man and the appearance of his wang dang doodle . as far as the ending , i did see it coming , and despite the fact it was completely ridiculous , it was suitable for this story . anchor bay entertainment provides on this dvd a very good-looking , widescreen ( 1.85:1 ) anamorphic print , along with mediocre dolby digital 2.0 audio ( some of it was really soft , in terms of the dialog , but perhaps that was for the best given the script ) . special features include a lengthy theatrical trailer , a bruno mattei bio , an interview with mattei titled `hell rats of the living dead ' ( 9 minutes ) , and a 5x7 reproduction of original poster art included on an insert , the flipside listing the chapter stops . cookieman108 by the way , i think plenty of rats were harmed in the making of this film ... also , if you 're interested in buying this dvd , i 'd suggest doing what i did and buying the anchor bay dvd fright pack : man 's worst friends , which features six films including parasite ( 1982 ) , lucio fulci 's the black cat ( 1989 ) , slugs : the movie ( 1988 ) , bruno mattei 's rats : night of terror ( 1984 ) , zoltan , hound of dracula ( 1978 ) , and dario argento 's the cat o ' nine tails ( 1971 ) . it 's available here on the amazon website , at a really good price , and cheaper than buying the individual releases .
