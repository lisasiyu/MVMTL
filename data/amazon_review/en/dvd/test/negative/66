land of oprahisms having avoided seeing this film , i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on , brought `` tuesday ... '' unbiden into our home.my aversion to oprah and her ilk , does not cloud my dislike of this film . a bad film is a bad film.devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned , and directionless directing , this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned , to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward . something should occur , my interest should be engaged . this film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses , and attempts to build the plot from words alone . it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said , `` hey , this book is full of words , lets make a movie . `` in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.to be honest , jack lemmon was not very good in this film . he played the same character he always did . just older . hank azaria was just awful . he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones , and was wooden and expressionless . maybe he was too embarrased to be there . as to the other actor 's ; well they filled up the space nicely.the look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality . the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was . they even covered the green leaves on the trees . some better acting , some good r rated dialogue , and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film . as it stands , however , it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and dr.phil , etc . the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.it is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs , but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases , a good cry , and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.i , for one , think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial . then pull the finger out , and just get on with it . ( to the grammar and form police : i did have this in paragraphs , but the editing process scrunched it all together . sorry
