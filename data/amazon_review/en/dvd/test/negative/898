gangsta king given the subject matter , one could hardly expect a high budget production but what gangsta king delivers is little more than a modern day blaxploitation docu-flick . understandably greg `` batman '' davis is seeking to portray raymond washington in a favorable light but putting it out that raymond was totally against guns and never carried one is taking it abit far . contrary to legend , the crips were violent from day one as were the l.a. gangs which pre-dated their emergence . the most interesting thing about this documentary is batman 's photographs beyond that this is one documentary you would be best served renting or borrowing from the library . the historical recreations of past events is terrible due to poor acting and this sums up the rest of the video . low budget , low quality , low class
