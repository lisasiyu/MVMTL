omg . so bad . so very , very bad . painful . no , seriously ... this is bad on a rare scale . forgive me , but after watching this festering pustule of a movie i 've simply got to rant a bit . i normally do n't trash films , but this one deserves it so badly ... i 'm sorry . this is a movie that 's about as interesting as watching grass grow . a chimp with a camcorder would shoot something more interesting . i wish i could give it a negative rating but the pop-up menu only allows a `` 1 star '' as the lowest . i ca n't remember a movie where the audience 's time is wasted any more completely than with this crapathon . you know when you go to someone 's house and they show you home movies of their trip to the beach ? and you have to sit through two hours of not much going on while their kids play in the sand ... and you keep looking at your watch wondering when it will ever end ? well , that 's `` raiders of the lost ark '' compared to `` open water 2 '' . the three stooges are brain surgeons compared to the characters in this movie , the writing and story are laughably bad and the director makes ed wood look like martin scorcese . maybe they ran out of money before being able to complete the movie they originally intended to make ... because if not , those who made this pitiful excuse for entertainment should be thrown off a boat somewhere as payback for the time they caused everyone who watched this stinking dung heap to waste . pretentious , annoying , stupid on a monumental level . this movie makes catwoman , basic instinct 2 , jaws 4 , etc . all look like citizen kane .
