some little gnostic ideas with lots of unpleasant music ! well , i must say that the dvd has many aspects : 1 . most of the music is absolutely annoying and horrible for a topic such as gnosticism . furthermore , the volume of the music itself sometimes does not allow us to listen clearly to the words of the narrator . 2 . everything in reduced to this : gnosis is an alectromagnetic experience with the quantum universe that lies within the self . hence , to be illuminated by christ or to be a buddha is just to achieve an electromagnetic condition offered by the union with the universal mind and the kundalini in us . 3 . the narratror fails to expose a very important and key idea : there are two types of kundalini and two main centers in the human body . he never speaks of the kundalini of the heart . he speaks only of the lower kindalini , the one responsible for the human sexuality . 4 . anyway , it is worth to watch the dvd once . but be prepare to endure a very disgusting and annoying music that hides the most important thing : the words of the narrator ! too much especualtion , at the end . it is sad that there is not yet in the market a good dvd on gnosis or gnosticism , made with ellegance , fair scientifical research and seriousness , without any music at all as the background . this dvd is an excellent example of how annoying can music be !
