another van damme flop purely for fans of crappy van damme movies again like i says . really corny from beginning to end . paul sorvino is totally and utterly fat and moronic in this one . rob schnider is wasted and why the hell was he in this i will have no clue . van damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in double team . with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said hey ! ! ! ! damnit , lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here
