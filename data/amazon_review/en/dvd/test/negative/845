2 stars for poor quality dvd . great movie . i have read in another review that the `` john wayne collection '' edition of this dvd is of poor picture quality . i have the `` collector 's eddition '' , and the picture quality is terrible on this one as well . this is a great movie , a classic . it was filmed beautifully in ireland and deserves better then this . i hope the studio will one day give this outstanding movie the treatment it deserves
