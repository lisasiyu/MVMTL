... horrid movie . i ca n't believe how disappointed i am in this anime . i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad . but it 's not . the little girl annoyed me so much . i just ca n't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her . omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie . ca n't stop ranting yeah ... for those who have n't seen it , you might like it like everybody seems to but ... i would not recommend it at al
