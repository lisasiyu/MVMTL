a silly sexual farce ok ! so it had a swiss cheese plot . that 's not so unusual for a soft core move is it ? i 've seen my share of soft porn movies and usually , not always but usually , what was lacking in a storyline was made up by the fact , that numerous gorgeous gals were romping around in the altogether , doing stimulating things to make you forget , there was even supposed to be a plot . yes , bacchanalles had a lot of nudity and a lot of make believe sex but except for the star , joelle coeur , who was genuinely a looker , most of the rest , looked like the girls , that get better looking at closing time . i know everybody ca n't always be fussy about the women they make love to , but certainly , they can be fussy about the ones they watch women make love . right ? so what do we have ? we have a plot , which , believe it of not , could have been the inspiration for `` eyes wide shut '' . oops ! i 've already said too much ! bacchanalles sexuelles , meaning `sexual festival` , features a generally unattractive cast of amateurish , stiff ( not that way ) actors and actresses , performing mostly sans clothing , in a fairly low budget , thirty year old erotic , french movie , with subtitles , where you sometimes have to choose between reading the subtitles , or watching the action . still interested ? read on . valerie , the one bright spot in the movie , played by joelle coeur , who along with her friend sophia , ( brigette de borghese ) is apartment sitting for her cousin , when sophia , unbeknownst to valerie is kidnapped by a sex cult . valerie is awakened in the morning by fred , whom sophia apparently invited over without valerie 's knowledge . fred forces valerie to have sex , which she ultimately enjoys . in the meantime the culprits realize they have kidnapped the wrong girl , for they really needed valerie and not sophia for their evil purposes , so the head seductress , ( my expression ) sends one of the cultists , pretending to be a maid , back to the apartment to garner information on valerie , where she promptly ends up in a bathtub with valerie and fred before taking their ma`nage a trois to the small ( double ) bed in the bedroom , where the action continues for what seems like hours . eventually the real maid shows up and fred and valerie , the super sleuths ( that`s sleuths as in detectives , not sluts as in ... . ) that they are , start to unravel the mystery of sophia . but not until we have a half dozen more sex scenes including the grand finale , an orgy of cultists . wow ! conclusion i suppose this movie in a sense was an orgy . an excess of mediocrity . it also had a sense of absurdity . this may have been purposeful , which , it was would somewhat mitigate against the amateurish feeling of the film , however , that said , for all it`s weaknesses , it was n't that bad . like i said the story was full of holes and except for two ladies , the femmes were closer to homely than attractive , or they were hard and used looking . that said , their bodies were decent and the were enough ( probably a dozen ) sex scenes , that i would n't stop anyone from watching this bomb . another point should make is that being filmed over thirty years ago and in europe , the girls were unshaved , including in some cases , under the arms . also the color quality was a little flat .
