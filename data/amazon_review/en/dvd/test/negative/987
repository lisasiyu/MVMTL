throw your metaphorical tomatoes i 'd be hard pressed to find one funny skit -- no , one funny moment at all -- in this dvd set . mencia 's drivel pretty much reminds me of a lot of david letterman 's `` top ten '' lists ; anyone above the age of thirteen could have thought any of this up . it 's actually mind numbing how bad some of these jokes are . i 'm not bashing -- i 'm warning . comedy central is advertising this as sort of a replacement for the ( much ) superior chapelle 's show . viewer , do not be fooled . carlos mencia is the most boring man on television . but i 'll give him this ; if he came out with this material in the early 1990s , it may have passed . but , like `` mama jokes '' , this humor has long dried up . 0/1
