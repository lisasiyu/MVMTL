baby einstein dvds are some of worst baby dvss ! i have bought 30+ baby/infant dvds from different production companies , such as the `` so smart '' series , the `` brainy baby '' series , the `` your baby can read ! '' series , and the nite light abc dvd . baby einstein dvds are the lowest in quality , cheap toy props , boring music , nothing stimulating . i would recommend the so smart dvds and the brainy baby dvds . your baby can read ! are ok , not very high tech , but it could work .
