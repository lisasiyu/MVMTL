not to be mean but there 's a true absence of a development let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie . 1 . it is incredibly beautiful animation 2 . the music is amazing 3 . i happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series the things i do n't like about the movie : 1 . the characters are not developed at all 2 . you get the feeling your only skimming the surface , like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3 . it almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process . ok you may have see that i gave this moive a 2 out of 5 , well that is becuase of the story line and plot.the story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation . the movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end . i just kept thinking there has to be more . but there was n't . the best way i could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just could n't find its parents . this movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff . but if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please do n't buy it rent it first . i 'm not saying its a bad movie by any means , just a bit empty for me.just one more thing the escaflowne series is very very good do n't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series
