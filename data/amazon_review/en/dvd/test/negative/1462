promises much , delivers practically nothing to begin , i am not a big fan of cary grant , except in his hitchcock movies , where he was excellent . and i enjoy him much with katharine hepburn in bringing up baby . he was very good in the eagle and the hawk with fredric march . he was tolerable in the philadelphia story and talk of the town . a friend of mine loaned me this dvd ; she just bought it . i had wanted to see what cary would do in this film , and i wanted to see him in the dress . from the start , the movie was slow and boring , all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny . i also do n't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other , and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other . come on ! i just ca n't understand that sort of romance situation . i felt cary showed that `` mean streak '' he can show in some of his films , in the romance situation of this story . i rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end . all the while i kept saying , `` let 's move along , let 's end this thing , when does he put on the dress ? ... '' but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring , corny jokes . and the part we wanted to see , cary in the dress , was at the very end and not very much at that . overall , this film was a real disappointment and letdown . the only consolation was that i saw it for free ; i did n't have to buy it or rent it . still , i wasted good time that i could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way . i would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie ! to sum it up , a very very boring and dumb movie , not to waste your time on .
