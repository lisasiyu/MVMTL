unworthy sequel in 1978 , when film critic roger ebert interviewed irwin allen , the mega-producer suggested a potential story idea for a planned sequel to `` the poseidon adventure '' ... the survivors of the poseidon disaster would be rescued and taken to land in italy where they would be placed on a train which would go through a tunnel in the alps . the tunnel would collapse and everyone would be trapped under the mountain . ebert thought it was an excellent idea . and as it turns out mr. allen should have went with it . because the movie he wound up making is an idiotic waste of time ; ranks among the worst sequels ever made ; and marked the beginning of the end of allen 's reign as the `` master of disaster . '' side note : allen directed this mess and , as `` beyond tpa '' star michael caine said in his autobiography , good ol ' irwin should have stuck to producing ! worth a look for `` poseidon '' fans , but that 's about it .
