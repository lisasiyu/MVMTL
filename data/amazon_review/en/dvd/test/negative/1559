amazing cast-weak movie secret agent was quite a disappointment , considering the makeup of the cast : gerard depardieu , robin williams , bob hoskins , christian bale , and patricia arquette among others . the movie brings to the screen the story of an englishman , living with his young wife and her retarded brother in the city of london . things , however , are not as they seem in 19th century london , with spies , double agents , anarchists and revolutionaries having a field day ... in short , the acting is surprisingly average ( ! ) , the setting is pretty good , while the dialogues and the plot are below average . the movie has that sherlock holmes feel about it , but without the `` magic , '' meaning that in the end you are left ... numb , and wondering : `` was that it ? '' as for the rating , it could have been pg-13 . though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off . a shame really ...
