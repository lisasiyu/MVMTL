take out your hunting knife and gut the book never have i seen a movie violate a book so badly . john grisham 's runaway jury is a moral microcosm of free will versus addiction , in which the widow of a life-long smoker takes on big tobacco in the courtroom . the movie runaway jury is a slapped-together suspense chase , in which the entire premise is changed into the widow of shooting victim taking on gun manufacturers . this movie is , at most , a caricature of the book , and not a flattering one at that . hackman transforms fitch 's quiet menace into arrogant buffoonery ; a man who waves his arms and throws phones at the wall . parts of marlee 's life-altering past are tranformed into vaguely impersonal events . the most interesting aspects of the story -- jury selection and nicholas easter 's manipulation of the court -- are grudgingly presented in minute-long montages in order to get back to the yelling and frantic running around . if i had never read the book , i would consider this a run-of-the-mill flick , rent-worthy at best . but knowing how atrociously the screenwriters have butchered the concept makes the movie all the more empty and sad . even if you are n't a lover of fiction , i highly recommend buying the book instead .
