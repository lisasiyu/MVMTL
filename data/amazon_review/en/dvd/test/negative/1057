long , boring this was so long and drawn out . it took over 3 hours for this film to lay out what any crime show could have done on tv in an hour , including all the commercials . there were so many scenes that just went on and on - that 's what they make dvds for : to cut out long useless scenes to add to the `` deleted scenes '' special edition , so people who actually liked the movie can watch more of it , haha . acting was n't even very good and not always very believable . just cheesy . save yourselves 3 hours of your life . also , i have no idea why one reviewer thought there was no sex . though it really was n't as violent as most movies , still it 's no family movie
