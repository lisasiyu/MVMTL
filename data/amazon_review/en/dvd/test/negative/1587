good start turns out to be a very poor slasher only michael ironside performance is worth watching . linda purl and william shatner plus the lead nurse should all have been fired for their telentless performances . this movie is a waste of a good premise , less bad mugging performances more gore and suspense would have made for a better slasher movie . avoid unless you like wasting money , so many better slasher movies than visiting hours . terminal choice is a far better example of a hospital based slasher , why could'nt anchor bay release that instead
