the worst subtitles awards goes to ... i ca n't believe the other reviewers were reviewing the same dvd . this is a great movie , do n't get me wrong . it 's kurasawa , after all . my one star is for the people at mei ah who put out this dvd . whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak english well enough to graduate from a level one esl class . the subtitles are truly terrible , sometimes bizarre , and i thought at times i was dreaming i was watching a monty python skit . alas , i was not ; this was for real . such a shame
