the devil bores read-a and moviego-a i read the book and saw the movie , which other than title and major characters , have little in common . i ca n't say i really liked either . the book is a little funnier . my major learning from the whole project was when `` who wants to be a millionaire '' taught me about `` roman a clefs '' , of which `` devil '' is one . perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry , i 'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that `` devil '' provides . meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly , editor-in-chief of runway magazine , but somehow she 's never quite devil enough . anne hathaway is passable in her second ( or third ) `` made over princess '' role . the minor characters , including the wonderful tracie thoms as `` best friend '' lily , are mostly wasted .
