brilliant actings , predictable story ! i 've seen ethan hawk 's best performance ever in this movie . it was great . wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie . it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me . maybe i 'm not right but in my opinion , this movie does not worth to buy . does not even worth to rent . but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it 's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally . it 's worth to be watch once at tv ! by the way , i forgot to mention that this movie has a great cd soundtrack , really great . worth to buy
