conservative , silly , embarrassing and 'dumbed-down' i saw this atrocity at an i-max cinema . i wish i had n't . the whole thing is something of a travesty of the original fantasia . the musical selection is humdrum and conservative - compared to the original . the imagery and animation is pleasant but unexciting . the guest spots are embarrassing and twee . if you have an interest in seeing something special done with music and images , check out christine schï¿½fer 's `` one night . one life '' or christian chaudet 's dvd of stravinsky 's `` le rossignol '' . do n't bother with this atrocious neo-con / religious right world vision . in the original we had stravinsky at his wildest and dinosaurs and in this we have noah 's friggin ' ark and elgar at his most stodgy and conservative . there is an almost tangible pusillanimousness about this fantasia 2000 `` thing '' which i found most distasteful . let us hope that this idea stops with this one - or maybe they should hand the whole thing over to someone else to do ? maybe miyazaki ? or some european directors ? fantasia 2000 is n't fantastic or much of a fantasy , to tell the truth .
