had to turn it off i loved `` the rm '' and expected the same level out of this movie , but my husband 's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest . the teenagers did n't even want to check it out after that scene . they also loved `` the rm '' . if you can get it from the library go ahead , but do n't spend money on it
