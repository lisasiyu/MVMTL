johnygluebag ****this review is not for the superbit version***** the 2 star rating is not for the movie , but the fact that the description on this site says its widescreen ; it kind of sucks when you get the movie in the mail , it says on the movie case its widescreen , yet its full screen , not much you can do . can someone at amazon change the product description to reflect whats going on ? it would help out
