( 2.5 stars ) his best in years but still needs something more the title 'wake of death , ' new film of jean-claude van damme , is rightly given to the very violent contents . van damme plays a bouncer ben archer who is quitting his job after seeing what he does n't want to see for 20 years . but he has a beautiful wife cynthia ( lisa king , 'home alone 4 ' ) and a kid at home , and all he wants is just a quiet life . anyone who knows some rules about action flicks will detect what will happen to his family when kind-hearted cynthia ( who is an ins officer by the way ) takes home a little chinese girl found among the refugees from china . and the little girl is connected with a chinese triad , in fact , a daughter of a ruthless boss sun quan ( simon yam , 'tomb raider 2 ' ) . and these events occur at the night when cynthia and ben are sleeping together in bed , showing part of their bodies in the ill-lit room . [ typical revenge story ] yes , van damme is getting more and more serious these days , as you have seen 'in hell ' recently . 'wake of death ' goes similar course , but this time it 's a revenge story with more violent actions with shoot-outs and car-chases . though the script is a standard one , one inventiveness is found in the relations between van damme 's hero and his former associates french mafiosos . these french gangsters give a timely help or two to van damme 's character in a more bloody fashion than the italian guys who were seen helping arnie in 'eraser . ' so how good is this film ? it depends on your expectaions . 'wake of death ' shows fairly good car stunts and shoot-outs , but the lack of imagination on the director 's side is too obvious . my opinion is , it is much better than 'derailed ' ( his worst ) , far below 'timecop ' ( arguably his best ) , on par with 'the order . ' but it 's just my idea . the point is , van damme shows pretty good acting here , but the actions , or the logics behind them , look awfully disjointed . the bad guy 's motive to bring back his daughter at any cost is never explained , and the relations between the characters are very confusing . ( case in point . you get a glimpse of two veteran actors burt kwouk , 'cato ' of 'rerurn of pink panther ' and jacqui chan , 'the world of susie wong , ' but the moment they appear on the screen , they get killed , without leaving no impression on us . ) but most damaging thing is the film 's shoddy editing that virtually killed some of the good stunts such as two motorcycles running in a shoppoing mall . i still do not know what happened at certain point of the story . philip martinez , formerly producer of b action films such as 'dot kill ' or 'house of 9 , ' gives his second film as director . ( incidentally , his first feature was , the imdb says , 'citizen verdict ' ( 03 ) starring armand assante and jerry springer ! ) as to 'wake of death ' he decided to shoot this film in south africa though the story is set in america . fans of van damme might hail the film as his come-back . i do n't know , for i still fondly remember joyful thrills when i watched his 'timecop ' or 'universal soldiers . ' 'wake of death ' is good as grade-b , straight-to-video actioner , but it 's not good enough for me .
