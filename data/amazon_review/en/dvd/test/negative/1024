poor sound & episodes from complete season1 i thought that perhaps i was losing my hearing . i looked ( in vain ) for subtitles to see if that would help . my partner assured me that no , my hearing was fine , the audio on these dvd 's is woeful . then i started to have episodes of deja vu . or maybe jkust episodes that were on the complete season one were included in this . huh ? very strange . i wo n't buy again until they do something about the audio . it is headache enducing
