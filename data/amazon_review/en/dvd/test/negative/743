a lot of effort , little substance . there 's not too much i can offer here , since i found very little to grab my attention throughout this movie . a lot of nice shots of the robots in this , and the color tweaking really did help keep the cgi effects seem more real in their settings . i 'm sure there has been some debate over the use of sir laurence olivier in this movie , but that 's not something that i think really applies to my overall sense of the film . i am sure that a lot of nostalgia and sentimentality can be attached to this film in the way it pays homage to classic science fiction and old cinema . a lot of the camera angles , costumes , the shapes of the robots and weapons , all reminisce upon cinema and comic books of yore , and in concept this film is a good reminder of those days of pure invention in science fiction , as silly as they may look to us today . but this trip down memory lane was down a poorly chosen lane . there are plenty of comic books and movies of the time that were also very eerily accurate in their predictions of the future , and because of that they 're not often harked upon . instead , this film goes for the silly sci-fi and wraps it in a package that was clearly tweaked by many a studio executive to make sure there were romantic moments , a spiffy sidekick , and enough explosions to keep popcorn eaters eating . this movie felt like a lot of effort with little substance .
