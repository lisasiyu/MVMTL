here 's a puzzler : who 's the most loathsome cast member ? i am being generous in giving this film two stars . i saw a trailer for it , and while it looked intriguing , looks can be deceiving , much like the bulk of this would-be psychological potboiler . i think the photography work and acting deserve a minimum of two stars as both were excellent ; the general storyline , however , was drivel . many reviewers have noted how the film fundamentally makes no sense , and there are parts where i agree wholeheartedly . i do n't mind thought-provoking films that leave you wondering what actually happened , but this was mostly in the shallow end from the standpoint of plot construction . it is inconceivable to me how the two female leads ( charlotte rampling , and ludivine sagnier ) could tolerate one another ; further , it is incomprehensible why rampling did n't merely leave france when sagnier started making her life miserable . to believe that rampling would actually help sagnier conceal murder is impossible . yes , i know that the entire character of the daughter is ambiguous by the end , but inasmuch as the character was constructed in rampling 's mind to be a murderess negates charges of cinematic intellectual superiority and holds rampling 's judgment suspect . the entire movie is filled with characters that are excruciating to watch , and the only real reason for a two star rating is that the actors do an outstanding job in their roles . i considered briefly watching the film a second time to make sure i understood all the nuances , but i just hated it too much the first time to give it a second chance . this is one film that looks positively great as a two minute theatrical trailer , but looks positively awful in the light of day as a hulking 103 minute feature . i am very open-minded to unusual , imported , and avant-garde films , but while this movie had touches of all three , i was merely relieved when it was over .
