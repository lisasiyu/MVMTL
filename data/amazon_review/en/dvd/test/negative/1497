first season was brilliant but second season is a huge disappointment i was thrilled by the first season 's creative and compelling representation of characters . the opening titles , music , dramatizations , editing , as well as , subtle humor of the first season , was an artful and poignant display of life to which many people , regardless of sexual orientation , could relate . i was immediately disappointed by the second season , however , as it quickly dissolved a great work of art and turned it into cheap pulp . i hope that the third and fourth season does n't make the same mistake .
