my friend has a better title : `` glimpses of bob '' i 'm giving this one star because `` zero stars '' is n't an option . there 's not a whole lot of dylan in this , and the `` home movies '' are just what you 'd expect from the days of 8mm film : grainy , blurry , black and white films from the tour ... not `` of the tour '' , just from the tour . tourist kind of stuff , with a lot of the back of dylan 's head , and every once in awhile he 'll turn around - which is why my friend has retitled this dvd `` glimpses of bob '' . and listening to mickey jones reminisce about his glory days of 40 years ago is kind of tedious ; mickey 's looking like he 's seen better days . save your money up and get `` no direction home '' , much more entertaining and informative
