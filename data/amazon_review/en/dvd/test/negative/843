[ 2.5 ] -- cheese-la-weez what happen here ? as curious as i was about this movie it had me dazed . the 'good shepherd ' always struck me symbol for christianity . shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten . what 's good about that ? fortunately , sheep do n't have the intelligence to be paranoid . with bourne identity movies under his belt , matt damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies . is this one a killer or dead on arrival ? with a budget of $ 85m , we 've got oscar-winning actors , writers , cinematographers , and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see . pet project of actor-turning-director , robert de niro , `` the good shepherd '' tells a story of the cia from its early days , weighing in at just under three hours . the scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that 's miss you wo n't get it . this is a shame , because it 's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot . this movie is told from damon 's point of view , its scope is epic , and covering the years from 1939 before the cia was even a speck in president truman 's eye , to 1961 and the bay of pigs . we see the founding years , the london blitz , post-war reconstruction in berlin , and increasingly intricate machinations as the cold war gathers pace . angelina jolie does n't feature in much of the movie , but when she does , she ' get into character very well . it 's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable . robert de niro ( got to love him ) , in the director 's chair , is sadly the weakest link . although he handles it professionally , almost magisterially , he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum , convey gradual moral decay , or make this the godfather standard-bearer of cia films . he 's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew . what he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world 's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity ; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to , given that his mentors are people like francis ford coppola ( who is the executive producer ) . with sufficient dedication , it is easy to imagine de niro pulling off an oscar for direction in a future film : his grasp is very broad , and all it needs is a little tweaking .
