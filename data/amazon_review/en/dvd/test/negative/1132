anger management fails ... i watched anger management on the plane . since there is nothing else to watch , and the flight is more than ten hours , you usually watch whatever is on t.v . i thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad , though there are some funny parts . there is some offensive language . overall , it 's a bad movie and is not worth watching .
