why this movie stinks in hollywood films , kids are mean . they tell their siblings to drop-dead , roll their eyes at dumb-old-dad , barf all over the floor and run away , and always seem to have a snarky come-back for every situation . they are cynical , jaded , suspicious , and totally lacking in innocence ; they represent the worst aspects of adulthood . in my opinion , films like this are like extended sit-coms - although most sit-coms are better written . my family was quite stunned by how nasty everyone was ; there was n't a kind moment anywhere except in the last 5 minutes , when syrupy-violins prompt us to recall how much they really `` love eachother '' . if you want to see a film where kids act and talk like real kids , try to get your hands on a british film called `` melody '' , made in the early 1970 's . it 'll knock your socks off .
