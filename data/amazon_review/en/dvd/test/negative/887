movie for the un-intelligent ... ? this movie has the most profound sense of materialistic humor . are we all so insecure with ourselves that we actually find this to be funny ? sublimally the sacastic scenes hitting upon peoples cultures and ways of religion down grades our intellectual consciousness as a society . i 'm not a stiff when it comes to humor , but i trying to be a gentleman in society am apalled with fox . fox network is a base for right-wing republican stupidity . this movie focuses on and reinforces the materialistic and superficial aspects of our inner insecurities . i think one should only see this film to see where the morals and values of american humor have gone . hurray for the 1st amendments and others our four fathers came up with , i think they were brillant men . i am all for free-speech but i believe there are parameters for moral and ethical conducts to showing a film to the public . this film definitely over stepped its boundaries . for all those people who loved this movie ... why are there sooooo many ( around 180 ) used copies that people are trying to sell when it just came out only a few months ago ! ? ! ? ! i thought good movies are the ones people kept and held onto ... just a fellow gentleman adding my two cents
