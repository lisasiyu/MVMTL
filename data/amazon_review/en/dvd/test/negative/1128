a 'minor ' note content of the movie aside , has no one noticed the cover of the dvd ? ? ? the american flag is backwards ! ! ! the field of blue is always on the left if the flag is hanging vertical . i 'm glad that disney did n't get to build its american history theme park in northern virginia back in the 80 's . if they ca n't get a simple dvd cover right , just imagine what could have happened
