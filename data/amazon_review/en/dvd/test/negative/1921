fifth is the final nail in the series ' coffin ... so bad ( and not the kind of bad you can enjoy ) `` return of the living dead : rave to the grave '' ( 2005 ) is , in short , not scary nor funny , another disaster in this series . i thought `` return of the living dead : necropolis '' ( 2005 ) was so awful , enough terrible to become the nail in the series ' coffin , but i was wrong . they made another sequel which is worse than the previous `` rotld . '' considering the badness of `necropolis , ' this is kind of amazing . actually `` necropolis '' and `` rave to the grave '' ( the fourth and fifth entries in `return of the living dead ' series ) were shot back to back in romania . director for both films is ellory elkayem ( `eight legged freaks '' ) , and `rave to the grave '' features some of the stars of `necropolis ' including peter coyote , aimee-lynn chadwick , cory hardrict and john keefe . `rave to the grave ' is about the high school students who survived the terrible zombie outbreak in the previous film . they are now college students and this time one of them finds a dusty canister in the attic , but instead of leaving it alone or reporting to the police , he and his friends take a sample of the slimy liquid inside and bring it to the laboratory in the campus . and ... here is the silliest part ... one student makes a drug called `z ' out of the sample and starts to sell it on campus . `rave to the grave '' relies on this silly one-joke idea about the zombie drug that not only makes people act like zombies , but actually turns them into real ones . the film runs out of steam halfway through the story , and the rest of it is about the repetitious battles between zombies and humans that are neither thrilling nor funny to see . two `men-in-black'-like hitmen are added to the humorless story of teenager zombie attack , but their downbeat humor does not work with the weak and pointless direction that fails to make the entire film a real gorefest or campy fun . the only good thing about the film is you can see tarman zombie , but only briefly . except for one mildly amusing scene , he has nothing to do in the film . he appears and stays out of the film most of the time . this is definitely the worst film in the `return of the living dead ' series , and probably nearly as bad as the notorious `` house of the dead .
