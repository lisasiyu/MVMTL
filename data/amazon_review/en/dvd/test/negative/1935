lagrimas of boredom boring , derivative and very mildly amusing . almodovar did it all before-and much better 20 years ago ! i could n't ever watch it for more than 30 minutes . the only positive comment i have is that the movie shows a more polished and upscale side of mexico and not the usual slums and sordid lives that seems to be so typical in mexican movies , at least those imported in the usa .
