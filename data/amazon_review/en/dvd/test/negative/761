moral relativism =propaganda the high praise heaped on this is by people who have never actually read anything by george orwell ( or francis schaeffer , or theodore dalrymple or even john mortimer -for the loyal opposition ) -trite , smug and arrogant opinions that warm themselves by the fires of this anti intellectual screed should have the honesty to read paleo conservative journals like american conservative to see that discontent with neocon foreign policy ( that went on for a full 8 years under clinton as well ) is challenged by both those on the left and the right.it is the lack of intellectual analysis and clarity that has created our current crisis . try reading `` how shall we then live ? '' by schaeffer or dalrymple 's `` our culture , what 's left of it '' for a more intelligent and cogent analysis
