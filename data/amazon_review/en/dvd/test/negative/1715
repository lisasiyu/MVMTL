the worst bond film ever ! after reading the reviews on here i went and rented this movie license to kill with high hopes and expectations . needless to say that i was let down . this bond movie is about one of james bonds best friends get put in the hospital while his wife is killed . so james goes on a revenge rampage defying m and mi-6 to do so . i thought that it sounded cool but it was a drag . it started out great with a lot of action and a solid plot . but as the movie progressed it got really slow . and the end is so fake and hookey that it comes off as comical . this is the worst bond film of all time ! it isnt worth even your time . now dont get me wrong i love the james bond series . and no-one can even come close to remotly compare with shawn conry ! he is the only true bond ! but the other bond movies are all good . in fact this is the only bond movie that ive seen that i didnt like . just dont even bother wasting your time
