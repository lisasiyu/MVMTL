terrible.terrible movie , avoid this one at all costs p.u.n.k.s . is a very bad movie even for a disney channel movie . a boy is feeling neglected after his dad dose n't make it to his party and then finds his father is making a suit that is a robotic suit for a evil boss that walks with a crow on his shoulder . this is by far the worst movie of the 1990s next to titanic . this movie is only for kids and idiots because this movie is awful . even randy quaid and henry winkler were embarrassed to be in this mess . if you want a good disney channel movie watch the paper brigade . the only good part was the credits
