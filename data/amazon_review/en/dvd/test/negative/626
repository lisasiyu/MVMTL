an interesting misfire lord knows the media is a worthy target for social commentary . however , it is also an easy one , and has been often targeted in the past . thus the central problem with `` mad city , '' costa-gavras ' updating of billy wilder 's `` ace in the hole . '' the film spends nearly two hours denouncing the media -- -namely print and television news -- -for a variety of social ills , for not all of which it can so easily be blamed . and those things it can be blamed for , we kind of already knew . nonetheless , an excellent cast works hard to bring off this story of reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) , who `lucks into ' an exclusive when a disgruntled , laid-off security guard ( john travolta ) takes his former employer and a group of kids hostage in a museum while brackett just happens to be in the bathroom . travolta is to be commended for taking on a part that is not particularly sympathetic , in the form of a character that is not very bright . he and hoffman carry the film as far as it can go , but by the end you are likely to feel that you 're being hit over the head with the simplistic central message , such that the tragic coda loses impact . it 's not a bad film , and with these talents it ca n't help but have its moments , but overall it 's a bit of a missed shot
