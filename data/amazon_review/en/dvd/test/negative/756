walt must be twisting in his grave ! this movie is very bad , and i mean horrible . vin diesel can not act ! what the heck was he thinking ? ! walt disney must be twisting in his grave ! ! i will never see this film ever again . the rest of the cast is disgusting , stupid , and terrible . they get dumber in every part of the movie , and a baby cries through a couple of parts of the film ... and it gets very annoying . if walt disney were alive , he 'd yell at vin diesel , and all the actors in this movie . and the final thing , this is not `` comedy '' at all .
