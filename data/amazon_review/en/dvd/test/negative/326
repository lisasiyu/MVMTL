terence hill , bud spencer , lionel stander in the west . also known as trinity rides again/ la collina degli stivali . the print of this 1969 italian western film is very poor . grainy and greenish sometimes . right away you will notice that terence hill and lionel stander ( a star is born [ 1937 ] , hart to hart tv series [ 1979-84 ] , hart to hart tv-movies [ 1993-96 ] ) have their voices dubbed by someone else . sometimes you hear stander 's real voice . stander plays a circus ringmaster . with his assistance he will help terence and bud spencer take down the bad guys in the west . difficult film to enjoy without terence hill 's real voice . victor buono also in the film
