movie is top - dvd is a flop ! this dvd gets only 2 stars because the 4:3 tv screen format of this dvd production is really ridiculous . but the movie is one of my favorites , number 4 on my all time best movies list . the feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70 's sci fi movie ( like 'andromeda ' ) than of a 60 's movie . austere and unemotional ( like colossus himself ) , quietly and punctuously narrated , minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain , as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world . i like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens , led displays , printout terminals etc . really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60 's . and captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings . attention ! spoiler ! the movie has no happy end , the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end . just as it is in d.f . jones ' novel 'colossus ' on which the movie is based . and that 's another reason why i like the movie so much - one of the few movies without a forseeable and boring happy ending . the absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending , by the way , contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer . this movie almost has the quality of a kubrick
