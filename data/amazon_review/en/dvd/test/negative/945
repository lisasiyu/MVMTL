1 star is too much - way too much the release of films such as these by fox can do nothing but bury l and h. all of their 40s films are awful and it 's a shame that that this wonderful duo will be judged by films like these . to see why these classic comics were so loved you must just hope that their silent 2 reelers will someday be rereleased . only then will you be able to really enjoy these two geniuses and see see why l and h are ranked up there with chaplin , lloyd and keaton . these two warm and wonderful men do n't deserve this - and neither do you .
