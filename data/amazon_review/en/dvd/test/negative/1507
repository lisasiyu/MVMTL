euro slasher anatomy reminded me of some of those european horror flicks of the seventies like twitch of the death nerve or suspiria . franka potente ( who gained american notice in the two bourne movies ) plays a brilliant medical student who stumbles upon a covert medical society which actually goes against the hippocratic oath . this society has a renegade faction that is performing autopsies on patients who are n't dead ! the movie moves a little too slowly for my tastes , and its dubbing takes somewhat away from the movie in that most of the voices all sound alike . the identity of the villain ( s ) is pretty easy to identify and once the movie establishes their identity , it just turns into one of those chase the heroine around in the dark films that culminates in a shoddy ending , and with sequel written all over it . ( anatomy 2 was made a couple years later ) . it 's comparable to our teen slashers , but because of the foreign aspects , it seems a little cheesier
