i secede `` philosophers often behave like little children who scribble some marks on a piece of paper at random and then ask the grown-up , 'what 's that ? ' '' - ludwig wittgenstein imagine spending an hour and a half with a teenage version of the sphynx from `` mystery men , '' but without mr . furious as a foil . instead , there 's the somewhat compassionate , somewhat opportunistic pearl madison , played by don cheadle . sometimes i was n't sure if cheadle was doing a really good job playing someone who is conflicted , or if his regret for signing up for this film was bleeding through on screen . the film is similar to `` mystery men '' in a way , though ; the filmmakers assembled a talented production crew , and a cast of some of my favorite actors ( including kevin spacey -- also one of the film 's prodcuers ) and put them in one of the most frustrating films i 've ever sat through . i guess i 'm just really tired of small movies about suburban life with fey , disembodied narrators spouting out random aphorisms and non sequitors . i would n't mind so much if the film was able to deliver some sort of epiphany , but it does n't . when the credits rolled , the only thing i was thinking about was a guy who 'd stabbed his girlfriend 's retarded brother , and writer/director matthew hoge asking , `` what 's that ? '' i may as well have watched `` elephant '' again . if exploring suburban angst is your thing , you might like this film . there are better cooked stories out there , though . i watched larry clark 's `` ken park '' afterward , which was like `` the united states of leland '' in a less wealthy neighborhood . both films were depressing , but i felt so gross after i watched `` ken park '' i promptly returned it to the video store , showered and cleaned my whole apartment . at least i was shocked into action . `` the united states of leland '' just had me crawling back into bed . the soundtrack is okay . the score is by sunny day real estate 's jeremy enigk . jena malone shoots up heroin to the pixies , and there 's a dot allison song i like in the credits that i 'd forgotten about . no cd was released .
