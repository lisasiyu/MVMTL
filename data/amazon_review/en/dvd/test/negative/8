embarrassing i did n't even want to see this movie , but my brother read the book and wanted to see it . ( we were unaware of the fact that this was n't meant to follow the book ... ) everything was poorly done in this movie . even hans zimmer 's score did n't save it . i 've mentioned that i 'd like it if one could rate an item with negative stars , and if i could , i 'd give it negative ten
