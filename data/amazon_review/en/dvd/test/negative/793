this lady snowblood does n't fly the princess blade is a homage to an infinitely better movie , 1973 's lady snowblood . it 's not like they try to hide that fact - it 's a homage , not a rip-off . the japanese name of both films , shurayuki-hime , is identical , and the two main characters even have the same name , yuki . in japanese , `` shura '' is a buddhist term very like `` hell '' or `` netherworld , '' a place of violence and carnage . `` yuki '' mean `` snow '' and is a common girl 's name . `` hime '' means `` princess '' or `` lady . '' `` shurayuki-hime '' is also a play on `` shirayuki-hime , '' the japanese name for snow white . all this according to the movie notes on the lady snowblood dvd . in lady snowblood , in meiji japan the titular character is the child of a woman whose husband and son are murdered by a band of thugs . after the murders , the wife is raped and tortured by the killers for three days . surviving that ordeal , she dedicates herself to tracking and killing the people responsible . she offs the first one but is then captured and jailed . dying in prison in childbirth , she charges - some would say curses - her infant daughter to finish the job when she 's old enough . for what it is , this is an extraordinarily well done film . even with all the extreme violence and second-rate actors overdoing their death throes as they spurt buckets of fake blood we 'd expect from a seventies japanese samurai flick , there are also moments in lady snowblood that are eerily beautiful . in the princess blade , in that unspecified near-future time so beloved of low-budget sci-fi , yuki 's mother is the leader of a gang of assassins . betrayed by one of her own , she 's also tortured for three days , but in this case does n't survive the experience . the daughter , unaware how her mother died - she 's only two years old at the time - becomes a member of the gang herself . not until she 's almost 20 does she discover the gang leader is also her mother 's murderer . after trying and failing to kill him , she runs for her life and the movie proceeds from there . if i may be allowed to seemingly digress for a moment : i believe that most people - unless they absolutely hate a particular type of movie - will enjoy any film , of any genre , as long as it 's well done . look at all the people not previously fans of anime who loved ghost in the shell . the princess blade is low-budget , hyper-violent , japanese chop-socky . it 's well enough done that if you 're already a fan of such movies , you 'll probably enjoy it . however , unlike lady snowblood , the princess blade is not well enough done to have crossover appeal , i.e . it just wo n't do it for people not already predisposed to like this sort of film . if you 're a genre fan , i 'd say of the princess blade , go for it . if not , and you just have an idle interest in watching a good low-budget japanese flick with a sword-wielding female assassin as the main character , i suggest passing on the princess blade and watching lady snowblood instead ( now available in an absolutely superb dvd transfer , by the way ) . you 'll enjoy the experience immensely more
