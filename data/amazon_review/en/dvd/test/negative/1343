charisma is capable of far better acting drivel . i 'm a 40 year old woman and i like `` chick flicks '' when they are good . i loved `` you 've got mail '' . but this ? this was just drivel . badly written , formulaic boring plot , and obvious ending with the very stereotypical idiot boyfriend prospects and supportive friends . you want to watch funny interactions between the sexes , watch friends or bbc 's coupling . you want to watch charisma act ? go rent buffy and angel . watch veronica mars . charisma did her best to be mary tyler moore , but in the end , she was an unbelievable character who i 'm supposed to believe as a wallflower . yeah . right
