a misstep to be missed unfortunately , this freshman effort from writer/director maria maggenti and her two lead actresses reeks of amateurism . littered with painful dialogue and clunky performances , `` two girls in love '' is implausible and inauthentic to the point of embarrassment . for a more believable ( as well as more intelligent and erotic ) young lesbian love story , check out the understated and off-beat bbc production , `` my summer of love '' ( 2004 ) . a similarly themed film that 's downright hilarious - and with a killer score to boot -- `` but i 'm a cheerleader '' ( 1999 ) is a gem . from the same year , `` better than chocolate '' has it all - humor , originality , plot , dialogue , performances , and sensuality . the only incredible thing about `` two girls in love '' is that it got released in the first place , as without its lesbian twist it 's little more than a third-rate romeo and juliet tale
