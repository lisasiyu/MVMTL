maybe now haters will appreciate `` darkness falls '' hunky guys , pretty women , and even scream queen pj soles ( who is strictly in here just for her name , because she 's useless ) ca n't save this one . using the same exact legend of that was the basis for darkness falls , this film gets worse and worse as it moves along , after a really creepy intro . the acting is terrible , and the bottom line is , the `` spirit '' of tooth fairy goes around killing people using modern day power equipment , like wood chippers and nail guns . there 's nothing scary or atmospheric about it . the only thing it has going for it is a couple of good gore scenes . seriously , if you 're going to steal an idea from a movie that was panned by critics and horror fans , seems like it would be a snap to make it tens times better . i 'll stick to darkness falls and it 's creepy atmosphere
