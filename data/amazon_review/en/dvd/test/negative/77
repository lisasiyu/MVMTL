mediocre is good ? i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average `` bad guys on the run '' movie . gee , billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all ; he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel . this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard
