has some decent acting , but ... a reggae musician begins to deal drugs for a drug kingpin so he could get the money for studio time . has a decent plot , but most of the acting is n't good , and most of the characters were just cliched charcters that you 'd usually see a jamaican actor play . i do agree that there is quite a bit of things to laugh at when watching this movie . not the worst of its kind , but , i do n't think its really worth buying
