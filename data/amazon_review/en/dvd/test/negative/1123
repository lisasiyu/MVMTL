hitchcock has done better do n't let the title fool you as it did me . for whatever reason , i led myself to believe the whole movie took place on a train in the same fashion rear window takes place all within one location . it does n't , but part of me wished it had . as far as the plot goes , two strangers meet on a train . guy , a pro tennis star , and bruno , a psychotic socialite . he proposes to guy that they both help each other , with bruno murdering guy 's cheating wife , and in return guy killing bruno 's father . part of this felt very throw mama from the train to me , but more funny . anyway , i have come to expect great things , and high tension from hitchcock , and sorry to say , he did n't deliver this time around . the best part of this movie is robert walker 's portrayal of bruno , who seems friendly and normal , but just by listening to him talk for more than a couple minutes , you get the feeling he is as far from normal as you can get . his performance reminded me eerily of kevin spacey . if they were to remake this movie ( and as much as i despise remakes , i believe they are planning one ) , they 'd be foolish not to offer it to him . so for what it 's worth , hitchcock is still the master , but do n't let this be your introduction to him if you 're new to his body of work , there are many superior choices
