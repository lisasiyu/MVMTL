fairy tale mob i have no idea what these other reviewers saw but it was n't the same movie i have . this movie in no way represents the life of la cosa nostra . there are so many scenes in the movie that are totally unrealistic . it 's present day and the guys are & quot ; running numbers & quot ; . hello , ever hear of the lottery . they start up a & quot ; bookie buisness & quot ; . besides calling it a bookie buisness , which is just plain retarded , how are 4 nobodies going to start bookmaking and become so sucessful that they are taking the action away from a mobster . then when they catch the attention of that mobster he thinks they have balls instead and takes them in to work for him . i guess if they made it true to life those guys would be in a pit in the middle of the woods chopped up in pieces and the movie would have been over . then again that might have been a good thing . the acting was terrible except for the late ray serra and joe d'onofrio . even joe viterelli who is a fine actor came up short given his terrible lines from a script that seemed like a first draft that needed tons of work . rent the hbo film gotti if you want to see what it 's really like . just to include wannabees and william demao in the same breath as goodfellas and the great living legend robert deniro is an insult . now demao is making & quot ; searching for bobby deniro & quot ; , he could only wish . the only reason i gave it a star is because i had to , they dont let you give it none
