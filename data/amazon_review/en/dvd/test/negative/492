ramtha who ? ? ? you know it 's interesting , when you open the ramtha web site of the `` school of wisdom '' , one finds a high school essay in neoplatonic metaphysics and alot of expensive courses and retreats , however when you hit the link that says who is ramtha , you get a `` this information is not available '' message , kinda makes you go , hhmmmmmmm ? ? ? ? ! ! ! now do n't get me wrong folks , edgar cayce and the author of a course in miracles might have tapped into something , but when someone stresses that good and evil are relative , it kind of reminds me of the lines in the revenge of the sith movie that palpatine gave to anakin to turn him to the dark side ! ! ! ! ! you know this fellow even sounds like a character from a sci-fi flik , you know esteemed jedi and all that but becomes a servant for the sith ; or even tolkien 's saruman , hey folks get christopher lee 's opinion of the dvd before you fork over your hard earned bucks , and uh ... do a search on this ramtha spirit , er channeled , er thingy ! ! ! live long and prosper ! !
