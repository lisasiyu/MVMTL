do n't be fooled ! i ordered this dvd for my public library 's collection along with the english language version . they are the same disc ! they have the same label numbers . the only difference is a small paper label on the 'spanish ' version 's disc declaring that it 's dubbed in spanish . both the english and spanish dubbed discs have the exact same content - soundtracks in both languages . shame on disney/buena vista for this horrible marketing ploy
