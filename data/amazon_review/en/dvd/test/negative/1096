great classic needs new transfer badly there is no reason to wait any longer for a better transfer of this classic . there was a japanese laserdisc release fifteen years ago from a pristine film source ; the intertitles were in russian and japanese ( an interesting combination since the events of the film took place during the russian-japanese war of 1905 ) . the opening sequence of water rushing over a diversionary dam , and of the sailors on their cots , is simply astoundingly better than any transfer we have seen released in america on any format . if the rumor is true of a 2004 digital remastering , we have waited three years too long for a quality dvd release . a film this great needs to be seen in the best transfer for its reputation to be understood by all . eisenstein directed the details , and the better the transfer the more details will be seen . none of current dvd transfers are at all acceptable
