there 's a big difference between nudity and quality nudity . if the girls in this film were considered `` hot '' back in 1979 then i 'm glad i was still in preschool . some unattractive women , not college age girls , but actual 30-year-old women who can not get into the popular pi sorority start their own sorority called h.o.t.s . which stands for help out the seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie . the goal of the h.o.t.s . girls is to steal all the guys away from pi house , so they throw `` wild '' parties , jump topless out of a airplane ( too bad the camera was on the ground ) , fly a hot air balloon over the pi house to launch pies on the pi girls as they sunbathe topless , etc . the script seems to have been written by a 12-year-old , which is n't a bad thing . i liked the fast-paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice . unfortunately i did n't find any of the girls even remotely attractive . if this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with nikki ziering , brittany daniel , shannon elizabeth and jenna jameson as the four main h.o.t.s . girls and maybe catherine bell as the house mom it would gross over $ 800 million in dvd sales . i also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots . how rude
