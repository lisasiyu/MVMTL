entertaining but not authoritative the two stars are for the entertainment value of this series . there 's no doubt that penn and teller can put on a show . however , this series proves very little . they employ the same techniques they blast as b.s . to make their points : questionable `` experts '' , misdirection , and even petty name calling . i have no doubt that most of the things they investigate really are b.s. , but to say that penn and teller `` prove '' them wrong is stretching it . if you want to have a good laugh and see some wonderfully pathetic examples of human gullibility , watch this series . if you want to see well thought-out , unbiased skepticism , this is n't it .
