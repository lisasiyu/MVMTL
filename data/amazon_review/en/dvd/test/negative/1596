yet another gutter scraping lack of quality in lesbian film ! wake up lesbians : this is nothing like brokeback mountain ! ! to begin with , the differences between this and brokeback mountain are too many to list . brokeback mountain contained some of the best acting ( by heath ledger especially ) in many years ; the acting in this movie was absolutely horrible . the cinematography was fantastic in bbm , this looked like it was done by children . the dialogue in bbm was utterly brilliant ; this had to have been written by someone with no imagination or connection to effective or real communication . bbm was a beautiful , honest , real love story told with unequaled poignancy ; this told the dark story of how lesbians find death a better answer than just living a happy , productive life like most of us do . whoever thought this to be even remotely good is a victim of accepting the crap that is tossed out there rendering ridiculous depictions of lesbians and lesbian life . ugh , and suicide ? ? ? next topic ! just because a film has a low budget does n't necessarily mean low quality ! this is a far too typical stinker of a lesbian film made as an excuse to show girls kissing and show yet another skewed image of how we live .
