the best part is watching the cliches fight for dominance this movie goes way off the unintentional comedy scale . a rag-tag group of survivors , containing every possible patented hollywood character , from the dignified elderly to the know-it-all wasp and the fiesty token minority , are subjected to a truly hilarious disaster that makes the poseidon adventure look like citizen kane . my favorite part of this film is the invincible dog . you can always tell a hollywood hackjob by the invincible dog , which always survives everything and is , gosh , just so darn *cute* that you 're supposed to get all weepy with relief when it survives through to the credits . a classic example is the golden retriever in independence day that , in an awe-inspiring display of poor blue screening , somehow jumps out of the way of a fireball that just destroyed los angeles..and of course just at the last moment . a cousin of that redoubtable pup is found here , where it actually disappears for half the movie and then suddenly comes paddling out of nowhere in a moment that is clearly intended to be triumphant , but is just flat out funny . it 's long been known that people watching a movie react far more emotionally to injuries to dogs than to people , but you 've stooped pretty darn low when you have to fall back on that as a plot device
