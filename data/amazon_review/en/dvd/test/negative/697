if you are looking for a real documentary , this is not it the editor decided that i do n't want to see how the plane crashes into wtc , or how people jump from windows , so , he cut pretty much all of that and who knows what else . instead , there is a plenty of news people 's talking into camera about where they were at the time and what they were thinking ( and why do i care ? ) , plus a bunch of stuff about anthrax to pad the little footage that was left .
