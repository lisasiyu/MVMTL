one of the worse in a while-not enough camp to make it fun . if a movie is going to be really bad , it should have some camp value added in : i.e . real humor of some kind , some excitement and unexpected events , and some good hammy dialog . this groaner has almost none of these things , at least to my understanding . i did watch this two times over the years , once in the theatre , and another buying this tape for 99 cents . i really do like most science fiction films i 've seen in the last 40 years , including many critical failures and campy low budget and high budget films . so i am qualified to submit an opinion . lost is space does have some entertainment value for kids . it is just ok , if you can turn down your iq rather drastically and lower expectations also . i was able to do both a little the second time , and enjoyed it somewhat . in the theatre , i ended up walking out before the ending . this is the only time i have done this because of a movie . ( one other time i did because of an audience laughing at some torture scenes , but that is another story . ) both times i saw this , the first part really seems like it is supposed to be a video game , and there is some expectation or question of when is the movie going to start ? the problem is , it never does . saying the story has not much revelance has become a cliche for movie reviewers who do n't have enough to support their arguments , but in this case it is very true . nearly every twist and turn of this story ( there are a lot for such a bad movie ) , causes the story to worsen . so by the end , when the story has no ending , one really does n't care at all . knowing that a needed sequel never got made gives one a feeling of justice in the universe
