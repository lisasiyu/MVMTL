i 've wanted to see this movie forever ... i 've wanted to see i am curious - yellow for what , 35 years now ? it made headlines back in the 1960 's when it was banned for having too much sex . now i wonder what all the fuss was about . there was a little bit of sex , a little bit of nudity - but only slightly more than janet jackson at the super bowl . only the government could get worked up over this movie . the other 98 % of the movie had to do with commentary on excessive militarism ( this movie was made during the vietnam era - the 1960 's version of iraq ) , western support for spanish dictator franco , and social justice in sweden . it might have been relevant at the time - and a small portion of it still is - but many of the ideas shown then seem quaint today . the movie ( as well as the blue version ) might be good for historical purposes , but it just does n't seem entertaining these days . i would have enjoyed it more in 1968 .
