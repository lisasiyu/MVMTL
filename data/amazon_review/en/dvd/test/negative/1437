not worth even the 1 star . wow , i was shocked at this dvd release . i read a review of this dvd on amazon and i though its going to be amazing . but i was trully dissapointed . derric green is not a good vocalist for sepultura and he doesnt play good guitar which is needed for the old song from max 's era . andreas cant play solos while playing old tunes because the drums and bass dont keep up and u dont even know what song they are playing at times its so bad . and as a stage performance by green its terrible . he dont even know how to move on stage . the guest apperancec what the high lite on this dvd . the documentary is so lame i wouldnt even call it a documentary . its just a bad dvd but with a nice cover thats it . sorry sepultura , time for a change in the front office . aka green giant . sorry
