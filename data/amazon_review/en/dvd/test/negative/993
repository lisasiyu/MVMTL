former martial arts sensei geting lazy the great one ( who is also a producer here ) takes up one of his worst films , namely sleep-inducing `the foreigner , ' and he does the same role that nobody seems to remember . one good news is that the sequel turns out more decent than the original , but that is n't saying much . in `black dawn ' steven seagal plays jonathan cold again , who is at first seen helping the brother of one bad arms dealer break out of jail , apparently working for the bad guys . well , perhaps he should have , for in that case things might have been more interesting than this dull b action film . besides the obvious stunt doubles , the inept editing , and the chubby face of the star who seems to prefer to stay out of the `action scenes , ' you will see cia agent played by tamara davies , also former protégé of cold . there is one so-so action involving a runaway garbage truck and some ok shoot-outs , but their terrible acting which occupies most of the second half of the film makes everything dull in the end . the idea of chechen terrorists or nuke attack are reduced to nothing because of the hulk of the star who seems not to care . what you see `in black dawn ' is your former aikido sensei getting lazy in his work . that 's a sad thing to see
