defective set i bought this dvd set as a christmnas gift for my sister , who is a huge fan of the show . unfortunately , she never got a chance to fully enjoy it . we bought and returned this set twice . at least one of the dvd 's in both sets was defective . and even when we purchased this item in a retail store , we ran into the same problem . so , avoid purchasing this product . it looks like this is one of those items that has a chronic problem and the company that produces it does n't even have the decency to make a recall
