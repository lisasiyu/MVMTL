i wish i could have seen it ! i was unable to view my dvd of ballet russes since the message on the screen said - not available in this area - or something like that . i have sent 3 emails to amazon to tell them i was unable to view it , and despite the fact they promise replies to emails within 24 hours , i have heard nothing . so i am not happy at all . i will let you know how good the dvd is when you send me a copy i can view
