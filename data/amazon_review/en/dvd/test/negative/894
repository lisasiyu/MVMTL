friday the 13th part 7 , the new blood in `` friday the 13th part vii : the new blood , '' we get to hear a narrator tell us the backstory . i do n't know who the narrator is ; the credits do n't mention him . it sounds like donald sutherland , but i bet it 's not . mr. narrator reminds us of what has happened to this point in the saga , ending with the fact that at the end of part 6 , jason was weighted down and drowned in crystal lake . mr. narrator informs us that `` people forget he 's down there . '' this is just stupid . a man responsible for nearly 100 murders in the space of 10 years does not just disappear from public memory . furthermore , when tommy jarvis drowned the bastard in part 6 , surely the cops and scientists would have then retrieved him , picked him apart , and studied him . his hockey mask would be on ebay . there would be an a & e `` biography '' episode about him . people do n't just `` forget he 's down there . '' but the forgetting is necessary for the story to move forward . it will be helpful if you , the viewer , have forgotten a few things , too . for example , remember how in part 6 , crystal lake changed its name to forest green in order to escape its bloody past ? yeah , go ahead and forget that , because it 's crystal lake again now . after mr. narrator spins his yarn , there 's a prologue ( which takes place on friday the 13th -- creeee-py ! ) in which a little girl who looks like the `` poltergeist '' little girl accidentally uses her psychic powers to kill her dad . surely we all have made errors like this at some point in our lives . it occurs outside the family 's house on crystal lake , mere feet from where jason is chained to the lake bottom , `` forgotten '' by the locals . next thing you know , it 's several years later . the little girl is grown up and named tina , and she and her markie post lookalike mother have returned to the cabin after apparently having been gone awhile . they 've returned because tina 's weird psychic/telekinetic abilities have made her a bit freakish , and a psychiatrist named dr. crews wants to `` help '' her , which really means he wants to use her power for his own gain . ( dr. crews , by the way , is played by terry kiser , who also played the corpse in `` weekend at bernie 's . '' this is an actor whose career consists only of low points . ) so while he 's trying to get tina to harness her powers , tina goes out on the dock and tries to use them to summon back her dead father . instead , she accidentally summons jason ; whoops ! he gets right to work and starts killing teen-agers , who are conveniently located in an adjacent cabin , having a surprise party for someone who does n't show up because jason has killed him . it makes you wonder what jason would do if he were revived on a weekend when no one was anywhere near crystal lake . would he bother hiking into town to kill some folks in a diner ? catch a greyhound to the next major city ? or just hang out in the woods , waiting for someone to show up ? the interesting thing about this movie is that it was directed by john carl buechler , whose credits also include `` ghoulies 3 : ghoulies go to college . '' the second interesting thing about this movie is that it features the return of the unsettling daisy duke shorts that men in the 1980s apparently wore all the time , if the `` friday the 13th '' movies are to be believed . the third interesting thing about this movie is that at last , there is something different to do about jason . in the past , victims have battled him by running , stumbling , and screaming a lot . usually they give up pretty easily and just let themselves be killed , often because they want out of the movie . but now we have tina , whose telekinetic powers are far more effective than mere knives or screaming . good to see someone putting a little effort into things . goodness knows the writer , director and actors did n't expend much effort . we wo n't bother mentioning that the acting and dialogue are atrocious , like they always are . if we do n't mention it , maybe you 'll forget .
