whip , gun and typewriter having read all these reviews presently on line , it was not hard to find a fair number with which i can agree that this is an abysmal film , even despite the surprisingly impressive physical production values , in the attention to detail that was taken to recreate the physical appearance of the death camp at auschwitz-birkenau . too bad a director with a script telling the truth about the place was n't there on the set with film and crew to take advantage of it . many an astutely observed fault has come to be mentioned in a good number of these reviews , as per the really tacky concept of the screenplay itself , the almost adolescent quality to the writer/director 's touch ; the lack of content in dialogue , the resulting shallowness of characterization for the actors ' roles . all of that was well observed , and yet what amounts to the worst fault of all remains without mention , the one thing i had hoped to find which would have obviated any necessity of adding one more , regrettably lengthy review to a long list of them . okay , so , am i the only one among the whole lot of us here who comes into it sickened by the violent vandalism that has been wreaked upon the historical record of the actual event by this writer/director ? artistic license is one thing but willful distortion of the public knowledge to a purpose of questionable motivation is quite another . if a viewer of this film is familiar with only so much as what can be learned about the revolt of october 7 , 1944 from the official website of the auschwitz museum at auschwitz ( see the article `` resistance movement at kl auschwitz-berkenau '' , a pdf file ) , then one fundamental fact will be known : that the only non-jewish poles who were in any way associated with the sonderkommando , were there exclusively in the capacity of kapos , not as crematorium workers ; they were the head-bashing s.s. appointed guards ( often imported from polish prisons ) whose duties consisted strictly in serving as foreman and cop , to keep the death machine running smoothly and well greased on the blood of jewish worker and jewish victim , alike . well might one inquire into exactly what is being served by tim blake nelson 's intent of assigning every sympathetic role in his script to either a gentile pole or the nazi ss -- oberscharfuhrer ( keitel ) who has to stay drunk to do what the jews are doing comparatively sober ? so you have these purely mythical gentile polish workers of the sonderkommando who are by far , moral superiors to the jews ( typified by the buscemi character ) who soon reveal themselves to be everything that the keitel character in his jew-hatred , only lately gained , has to say of them . and what had this ss-oberscharfuhrer eric muhsfeldt to say , but such things as would be based on strict observation , since having seen now how low a jew can really go , doing to their fellow jews , what they would so totally not want done unto them . yet what the harvey keitel character does n't observe , and what tim blake allen 's script does not observe is that these jews under his whip and gun ( and/or typewriter ) are doing only the same as this oberscharfuhrer is doing under nowhere near the force of coercion ; not to the jews alone , but as the ss enforcement arm of the gestapo , to any decent or dissident german , to the whole world , as a cog in the wheel of the greater reich 's death machine . and so the keitel character fancies himself to be shocked to learn that jews , just like any german such as himself , can knuckle under and bow , tremble in fear under the marching boots of tyranny , to the surrender of every shred of human decency for sake of howling `` sieg heil ! '' safely going with the flow of society ; how shocked he pretends himself to be to discover that jews are no better than he , that given the worst of circumstances , they like he should become killers , money-grubbing wheeler-dealers showing themselves to be by turns , brutal or calculating murderers -- traitors to their own kind . but this is not , alas , what is to be gleaned from the script of tim blake nelson 's filthy little movie . quite to the contrary , if a person is not aware of what actually did occur , historically , as from a book like filip muller 's `` eyewitness auschwitz : three years in the gas chambers '' , then you well might wind up pinning five amazon stars on the guy with the thought well implanted , most subliminally , in mind that ss-oberscharfuhrer eric muhsfeldt did n't really have it all so wrong , after all . it 's not hard to be tricked . see the fathers and mothers , brothers and sisters of mozart , goethe and schiller , circa 1933 .
