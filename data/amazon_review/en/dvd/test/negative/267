disappointing ... ... ... very disappointing the picture book of the same name by chris van allsberg is one of my favorite christmas stories of all times . so i was pretty excited to hear hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like tom hanks was a leading participant . what a disappointment ! the movie 's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy . there are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo ( apparently supernatural ? ) who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting christmas messages such as `` do you believe in ghosts ? '' the `` lighter '' scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling . admittedly i saw the movie in dvd format on the small screen and i am told many of the scenes played better in 3d . yet `` the polar express '' still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children .
