had promise , but failed to deliver . i have to agree with the other reviewers . `` legend of the rangers '' looked promising but ultimately did n't deliver . the sets and effects are excellent and the actinng 's not bad . and of course it was great seeing andreas katsulas reprise his role as narn ambassador , now citizen , g'kar , however these three elements could n't save the film . the mysterious alien race threatening the liandra 's crew were too much like the shadows of the series . if you 're a die-hard b-5 fan you 'll want this film , but if you 're looking for an introduction to b-5 go with the season box sets . all-in-all not jms ' best . which is sad because it had promise
