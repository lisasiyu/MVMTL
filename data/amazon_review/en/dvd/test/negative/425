where to begin ? the numerous historical inaccurracies are already outlined in other reviews . political correctness and post cold war jingoism maquerading as hindsight are to blame for this farce of a war movie . some of the historic elements ( like stalin 's `` not one step back '' order , etc ) are haphazardly crammed into a few opening scenes , creating an anachronistic mess . unfortunately , there are n't many soviet perspective films on stalingrad to choose from . would recommend this film to those looking for simple suspenseful -- if predictable -- entertainment with the novelty of a war movie that 's not from the `` usual '' u.s. or german wwii perspective . would not recommend it for anyone interested in historical accuracy or complex and original plotlines
