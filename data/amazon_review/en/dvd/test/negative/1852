do n't let the 'widescreen collection ' label fool you the rating is for the dvd , not the movie ( i 'd give the movie ten stars if i could ) . on my widescreen tv ( sony bravia 40 '' lcd ) , to watch this movie with the correct aspect ration , i have to watch it in full frame mode , which puts black bars not only on the left and right of the screen but , since this is a 'widescreen ' dvd , there are black bars on the top and bottom as well . apparently , when this dvd was released , you could just throw black bars on the top and bottom of the picture and call something 'widescreen . ' next year is the 20th anniversary of the movie 's release , hopefully they have an update planned
