it sucks , badly really , the whole movie sucks . let 's start from the top , the plot . now , as you probably know , the plot has nothing to do with the game , at all . in fact , the only thing remotely close they have is the name , and the bfg . the plot is genetic monsters take over some research facility and marines go in to save the day , you know the drill . nothing horribly bad , except for it does n't follow the game at all . however , this sad bunch of marines are the stupidest people on earth , and now mars . really . first , we have the kid , who is horrible at everything , he talks while he 's supposed to be stealthy , he gets high on mission , etc . yes , it 's his mission , but i thought this was an elite military team , not some club that just anybody off the street can join without having any military training . and portman , not only is a moron , but has a stupid grin on his face no matter what he 's saying . now , as for genres . for a horror movie , it 's not scary at all , not even a little suspense ( though i kinda wanted the characters to die , so i guess that lost the suspense to me ) . for an action movie , well , simply put , there 's little to know action , until the very end . and yes , there 's a first person shooter sequence towards the end , but don ; t be fooled , that is a gimmick and nothing more . without spoiling anything , i 'm just gon na say that the ending is incredibly generic . all in all , this movie is a waste of time and money .
