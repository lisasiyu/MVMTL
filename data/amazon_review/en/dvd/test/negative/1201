lackluster lear holm is a really terrific actor , but i have a feeling his lear is probably better served by the stage than by this rather uneven production . for one thing , he really does n't seem old and frail enough . and the supporting cast does n't seem particularly well thought out - or is it just the way they 're directed . there are some particularly unfortunate moments where we get to see goneril 's twitching , overwrought facial reactions during lear 's lengthy outpourings of invective , and the thing would be hilarious if it were n't so hard to watch ( and not in a good way ) . lear shouts and everyone shouts back . there is no variation or contrast in the performances . goneril , in particular , works better as a measured , icy presence , in my opinion . in a television production , we could still see his words cutting her as she keeps her infernal composure . the shouting matches leach the material of a lot of it 's dramatic tension . it sometimes seems as if everyone is playing mad here - except , perhaps , for michael bryant , who gives faultless line delivery as the fool . i personally do n't think 'lear ' has a chance of working unless as much care is given to the characters closest to him ( particularly the daughters ) as to lear himself . the performances need to be developed interdependently , as the characters are interdependent . the music of the piece does n't come out here . eventually , it becomes tedious
