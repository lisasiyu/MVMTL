great show , terrible dvds i want to first say that i love thundercats . along with gi joe and transformers , it ranks as one of the greatest cartoons of the '80s . the reason for my 1 star review has nothing to do with the show , but instead with the dvds . for such a price it really is highway robbery . the episodes look like they were taken from tv . no remastering or enhancement , you can still see white marks and scratches . also , as mentioned in another review , the background music is missing from some episodes . along with that , the menus are sorely lacking . they 're very short and without any imagination or flair . except for the main menu , all the submenus are just still images from the show . and do n't fall for the specials . there is a 25 minute documentary with some of the voice artists and producers , but it felt rushed . not all of the voice artists were interviewed , and with such a show , i 'm sure they have enough material for a full 60 minute documentary . one further complaint , no chapters in the episodes . the entire episode is just one big chapter . at least rhino was able to split the episodes into scenes . i would swallow my pride if this cost 19.99 or thereabouts , but not for this price . the lack of detail and quality just shows all over this release ; do n't you just hate corporate greed .
