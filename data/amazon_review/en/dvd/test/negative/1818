pointless ... obviously , the only reason disney had for making this movie was to test their newly created caps animation system , because other than a few impressive uses of that , this forgettable sequel has nothing more to offer . while the rescuers remains one of the studios most beloved animated , this one simply falls way back being one of the most uninteresting and bland disney releases of all time
