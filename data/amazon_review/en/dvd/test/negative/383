why are there so many reviews of a product not even released yet ? zero stars , for a product not yet out . ( 5 for a great series though ) while a few of the initial reviews , or should i say previews listing episodes , are informative , none of these writings here really do me , or most consumers any good , since this item has not yet been released ! amazon does the average consumer a disservice in printing these glowing , drooling reviews before we have seen the product - quality , the actual episodes released , packaging , possible defects ( like the magnum series & maiden 's last live dvd , both featured defective sections ... ) when the product is released , i will have to wade through 7 ( as of oct 3 ) b.s . pre-views in order in order to gain actual product knowledge before buying ... these pre 's , are presented by : fans ? industry sales schmucks ? amazon employees ? who knows , pre-buyer beware ...
