a dog in name and quality even with the promise of chevy chase dying in the first reel , this film is so dumb and bad . it 's easy to think that benji typed this film all by himself . except he would have eliminated chevy 's voiceover . i was so expecting to enjoy this film as a cheesy cinema classic , but it was too painful to be fun . chevy chase films like vinegar remains bitter no matter how old it gets
