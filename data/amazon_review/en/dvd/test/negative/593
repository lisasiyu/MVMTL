`` is this funny still ? yet ? i honestly ca n't tell ... '' seasons one , two , three : `` go man , go ! '' season four : the one to forego . speaking as a fan who was first stupefied ( amazed ; astonished ) by bob and david back when they were the kings of megaphone crooning ( `` people did n't want to hear songs about things that had n't even been invented yet ! they wanted to hear songs about new things . `` ) , that is , speaking as the rare fanatic , the rare `` mister mr. show '' raising his voice on amazon who laughs just as hard at the good g rated sketches as he does at the good nc-17 rated sketches , i find `` season four '' the most generous sampling of limp and lifeless ms sketches available in one package . funnyguy bob odenkirk , reputedly a rather gruff fellow in real life , says that four was the season when `` well-crafted '' sketches were `` in '' , `` absurdity for absurdity 's sake '' was `` out '' . no longer , he claims , was mr. show a comedy show best appreciated by other comedy writers . translation : they dumbed it down for the audience ( and/or : horsing around in the writers ' room suddenly earned you an hour in a pointy hat , facing the corner ) . enticing as the term is , `` well-crafted '' here seems to mean `` warmed over snl type stuff '' , as in : spicing up the world 's 1000th jerry springer takeoff by setting it on a lifeboat ( momentarily forgetting that incongruity usually works best when it is `` funny '' incongruity ) and ladling on the same gay panic , the same class anxiety that makes the real springer show such a howl . overall , ms4 's concepts become less novel , less thinky , less left-field-funny , with a stronger than ever reliance on the tried and true . what i mean is : a stronger than ever reliance on stoopid-guy raunch humor . but at least sgrh is a species of comedy . i have n't nailed down a label for what fills the cracks and crannies , and accounts for at least 75 % of of the ones and zeroes on these here digital donuts . excelsior ? ( ex-cel-si-or ( n. ) slender , curved wood shavings used especially for packing ( originally a trademark ) ) . this set did make me grin a few times -- over the course of five and a half hours . one , and only one , sketch makes me laugh out loud : the phenomenon of `` monster parties '' ( as documented in novelty songs such as `` halloween shindig '' , `` dracula 's pajama party '' and the like ) examined with pitch-perfect tabloid tv grammar . original , bent premise anchored by yet another simultaneously vicious and sympathetic david cross performance . for the most part , the gang seems tired , like they 're having an exhausting time at this point telling funny from not-funny . surely , anyone who makes a living intuiting what will make people laugh must at one time or another come to such a pass .
