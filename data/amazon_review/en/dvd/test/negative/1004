*yawn* *waaaah* i figured i would check this out , just for kicks , and i guess that the most important thing that i can say about it is that it was a waste of my precious time and i will never get it back : * ( i only wish there was a `` zero stars '' option . but guess what ? no matter how much i might disagree with mr. fleeger 's views ( `` oh , and you know i do ! `` ) , i respect his right to use his second amendment rights ! i would never suggest anyone throw away , burn or otherwise destroy this product because i find what he has to say wrong , which i guess is the difference between liberals like myelf and so-called `` conservatives '' this product showcases getting angry because the chicks dared express their opinions . i guess that it should n't be surprising that those who very likely could n't explain what the second amendment is about to understand how important it is for people ( such as the chicks ! ) to use them .
