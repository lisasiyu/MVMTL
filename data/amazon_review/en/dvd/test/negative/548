absolutely awful ! enough already of this street-hustler , drug scene `` coming of age '' wannabes . it has been done much better in `` johns '' and in showtime 's `` queer as folk . '' brendan fehr 's performance is an embarrassment . cookie , who sends her brother out to get some sex , is beyond belief . this movie has nothing to recommend it . no stars is my rating . but , thanks , amazon , for finding me a buyer of my dvd copy through my marketplace selling account
