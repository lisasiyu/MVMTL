awfully ... *yawn* ( yup ... it 's that dc hating teen on her dad 's account ) although gg is possibly one my favorite television series , i was disappointed with this one . possibly no character development , except maybe lorelai . jared padalecki 's annoyingly routine guest spots as married/in-denial/sleazball chump cheater dean forrester gets on my last nerve . i could smack rory for sleeping with him , and ruining his fated marriage . meanwhile , lorelai becomes almost ditzy . her relationship with jason stiles gets quite boring . she 's totally oblivious to luke 's obvious infatuation with her . emily and richard 's seperation is the best part ... watching them bicker is funny . the end kiss with luke/lorelai is the best part . otherwise ... do n't get it
