when hippies make movies i had looked forward to seeing this movie for quite a while , being a big sellers fan and a ringo/beatles fan - as well had heard through the grapevine that this was supposed to be a fun and interesting movie . it is neither . perhaps you could rate it a curiosity - if you happened to be a fan such as myself . the idea of the film would seem to offer great opportunities for both sellers and starr to shine , but the script and story ( what there was of it ) fails to deliver on the promises it alludes to . one strange setting after another ends anti-climatically , which in turn quickly leads to a sense of frustration at a great missed opportunity . it really does seem that they `` wrote '' it as they went along , if there was anything written at all . and one tired anti-establishmment cliche after another gives good example why professionals instead of hippies should run with the good ideas in order to see them well executed
