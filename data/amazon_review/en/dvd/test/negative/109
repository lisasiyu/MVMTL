good performances , astoundingly bad script stellan skarsgard and diane lane , two otherwise talented actors , completely embarass themselves in this absurd , trite and predictable `` thriller '' that turns out to be more of a comedy than anything else when all is said and done . skarsgard and lane play a wealthy couple who become the legal guardians of 2 teenagers when their parents are killed in a car crash . for some reason that is conveniently overlooked by the script , the fact that skarsgard and lane are 2 psychos is never realized by these parents , who have presumably known them for a long time . but of course , what place does logic have in this movie after all ? while the performances are all good , the actors can only do so much with the terrible script they 're given to work with . every plot `` twist '' can be seen coming a mile away . some scenes even exceed the point of absurdity , case in point : when skarsgard is able to take out an experienced police officer and then steal his gun . go insult our intelligence somewhere else . and what 's with all the product placement ? this probably earned the movie more revenue than box office sales . shameless . if there 's any saving grace to this movie , it is leelee sobieski , although it 's a shame that her breakout role was in this turkey . she deserves a script that equals her talent . but she is certainly nice to watch , especially the scene where she strips down to her 2-piece bathing suit revealing her bodicious , delicious , nutritious , i-want-some-of-that-icious body . but hey , when a movie has nothing else to offer it may as well cash in on sex appeal , right ? rent this one first if you absolutely must see it .
