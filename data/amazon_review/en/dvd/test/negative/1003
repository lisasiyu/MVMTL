this waiting waiting waiting is tough at the end of this film gene hackman 's character , strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle , finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug . this scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener . hackman plays harry caul , a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field . he gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film . more interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life . he staunchly defends privacy , even though it is his job to invade it . he refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him . i know that today it is very fashionable to criticize bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on . the chilling affect we watch take place in the world of harry caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today . simply because you are aware of bush 's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone . harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness , and while that may not be healthy i 'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way . while there are lessons here that deal with living in bush 's america , this still is n't a very good film . this is a much smaller scale than coppola usually deals with and it does n't seem to be a very good fit for him . the script was original and unpredictable . however , it was also slow and filled with nonsense . i watched the film twice and still do n't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end . also , the scene in which we visit harry 's twisted dream was a total miss for me . the purpose was to show just had mad he had gone . to me it looked like coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film . hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre- '' unforgiven . '' a dashing harrison ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten . still , this film falls flat . most of the film involves harry trying to figure out the entire conversation . the tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know big brother is using today . i liked the way this film reminded me of `` rear window . '' as in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him . it is a theme that affects us in our daily lives . every story we hear has holes and lies in it . we have to fill those holes and sort out the bs to come to a perceived reality . but what if we 're wrong ? nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel . if for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas . then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant , and whether your ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug . **1/2
