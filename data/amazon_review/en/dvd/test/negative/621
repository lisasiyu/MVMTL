hard to keep up with i would not recommend this video and wonder why it got so high reviews from other people . the pace is way too fast and they change positions very often . it was hard for me to keep up with all of the different positions as an adult . i could n't imagine how kids could . the kids on the video must have practiced for at least a year so they could all be in sync . i would recommend `` kick to get fit jr. - for kids '' by rich grogan if you are wanting a work out that kids can actually keep up with and is fun
