worst service - do not buy from these guys i only wish it were possible to give them no stars , or just red x 's . these guys never shipped my order , and even sent me an email telling me a different ship date then amazon . once that ship date came and went , i just made a claim to get my money back . a total of 2 months for dvd 's that were meant for a father 's day gift . these guys are clueless . stay away from them for sure . you 're better off going to target to buy dvd 's
