elizabeth hurley topless is all this movie has going for it . the only reason why i think this `` movie '' continues to actually exist is the fact that the luscious & amazingly gorgeous elizabeth hurley does topless nudity in the film . other than that asset , this film is absolutely abysmal . atrocious acting , hackneyed script , ham fisted direction and terrible lighting . it 's not even good in a so-bad-it's-good type of way . avoid at all costs and just download the elizabeth hurley nudity off of the internet
