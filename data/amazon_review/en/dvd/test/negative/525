a two-hour unfunny comedy do n't get me wrong . i love bill murray and i 'm so happy to see him get the critical attention he 's deserved . but these wes anderson `` comedies '' are just lame . rushmore started out with a lot of promise but fizzled out . the royal tenenbaums was a two-hour set-up without ever starting any story ( it felt like two-hours even if it was n't ) . and now the life aquatic . all of these films feel like colossal wastes of great casts . i do n't think there 's been a good comedy since a fish called wanda in 1988 ( although parts of the big lebowski are hilarious ) so i do n't think we have a good scale of reference when it comes to comedies . most stink . maybe the current generation of moviegoers have no idea what makes a great comedy . that might explain the glowing reviews here . although anderson 's films are competently made , they feel stuffy and pretentious . humorless . i chuckled once per hour . not a good average . i do n't think this movie ever makes up its mind . and i 'm so sick of owen wilson that i wish hollywood would give him a paid vacation . does he have to be in every single movie ever made
