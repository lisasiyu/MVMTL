no draft dodger here ! john wayne was no draft dodger as one of the previous reviewer ( moron ) stated : as wikipedia states : wayne was 34 when the u.s. entered the war and was raising four children , and when he requested deferment he was granted a 3-a deferment for family reasons . later in the war his deferment was changed to a 2-a deferment with the explanation that having him serve was not in the national interest . despite not serving , wayne did support the military through participation in uso shows for u.s. servicemen . i guess it would have been better if we had let the government take care of his children if he would have perished in wwii ? my grandfather also did n't server in wwii because he had three children to raise including my father .
