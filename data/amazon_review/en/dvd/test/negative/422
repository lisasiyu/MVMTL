i do n't get it there is one thing i finally grasped upon watching 'the 40 year old virgin ' , however . i came to the realization that hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ( 'the 40 year old virgin ' ) are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas . of course , they 're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental united states will be for , and laugh at , anything . this film is popular because steve carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on 'the office ' , and people just love those mannerisms ( ricky gervals is better in the same role , by the way ... but that 's neither here nor there ) . it certainly could n't be because it 's funny . the general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise . that concept added with the most boiled down middle school potty jokes is not . that concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive , yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not . that concept added with a cross eyed asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up 's of carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not . that concept added with 60 year old middle eastern salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not . you get the drift . maybe the boat left and i was n't on the boat . maybe i 'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating chocodiles . if you like juvenile humor , watch something like 'better off dead ' or 'caddyshack ' . watch a movie that does n't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh . sincerely , bill cosb
