junk , the whole movie should 've ended up on the cutting room floor i did n't read the book ; i purchased it based on the actors , that was a huge mistake . had i paid attention to the people who rated this with one star i could have spared myself the anguish of watching it . i have 24 movies with bruce willis in them and its goes without saying i now have 23 this went in the trash . i would n't think of even giving it away for fear someone found out i actually paid money for this garbage . i have a collection pushing 1800 dvds and this is the first time i have had to write a negative review
