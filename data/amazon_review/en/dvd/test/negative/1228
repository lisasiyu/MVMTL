this sucks . if you live outside the united states do not buy ! ! ! ! i only bought this dvd so i could watch the second disc with the version of the movie in hd ( wmvhd ) but since i do n't live in the us i could not obtain the license to watch the movie cause of the stupid drm bullcrap they encoded the movie with . after weeks of trying different things i finally got it to work but even now when it tries to play it makes the computer system unstable and the movie only plays one frame before going green . stay far away . do n't buy drm encoded stuf
