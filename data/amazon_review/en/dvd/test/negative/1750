weak winslow remake i must admit i am more than shocked to read some of these reviews . all those that have n't seen the original starring robert donat et al simply have n't lived . some scenes have been completely desecrated . the donat `` liar and a thief '' questioning scene of the young winslow , is one of the best in movie making history . the equivalent in this remake is so weak that even 'sir roberts ' attending solicitor also lends a hand in the questioning ! however it may have been david mamets intention not to even to attempt to try and emulate . likewise 'sir roberts ' courtroom speech was completely missed . beg , steel or borrow the origianl vhs copy , and if need be go out and buy a vcr just to watch and enjoy this gem . if there is a movie studio lobby somewhere to get 'essentials ' like this released on dvd i 'll join it ! ! ! !
