not too impressed the acting was very good . the pace was adequate . however , the plot was predictable . the movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome . clive 's character kept calling this the perfect robbery . the characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters ca n't possibly know what is going on . i 'm still not sure what jody foster 's character brings to the plot . any way , they do stupid things . the bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet . you do n't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie . however , they do call it a `` s -- thole during the movie . they spent hours on this hole . why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine ? they even brought buckets in with them . they were disguised as painters . why could n't clive 's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine . finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel . furthermore , the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag . i have to be honest , i did n't guess the ending . i kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues . for example , a big one is the title of the movie . however , the lame clues ( the s -- thole ) acted like red herrings . they threw me off the scent .
