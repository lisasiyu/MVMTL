low budget porn . the only reason why i watch this video is because hunk model tony ward stars in it . tony ward is that dreamy hunk that came out in madonna 's controversial justify my love video . since then i have not been able to get studly tony ward out of my mind . he is the only reason for watching this film . other than that the film is not worth anything , unless you are really into all that street hustling of hollywood . i warn you that this film is not very good . direction is bad , picture is n't that good , low budget , mediocre plot , and extremely explicit sexual scenes are characteristics of this film . the only saving grace of the film is the hunkster tony ward . if you want tony , then this is a good film to see all of him . otherwise , discard the rest of the film . this film is really not suitable for people of any age
