exercise video for people who really are n't serious this video is broken into six 10-minute sections . who in their right mind would work out for only 10 minutes ? this is not going to accomplish anything . well , you think i 'll just do all of the workouts one right after the other . this is silly too , because each 10 minute segment includes a warmup , small workout routine , and stretches . unless it is okay with you to do all this over and over again , it is not an effective use of your time . especially if you are truly trying to accomplish a goal
