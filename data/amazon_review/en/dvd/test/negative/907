the ads proudly state `` from 2 of the 6 writers of scary movie '' . need another reason not to see it ? the writers of this movie thought that referencing dozens of different movies would make a comedy . no . there has to be jokes , funny jokes . there needs to be something humorously said about the original films to make it a satire . i have seen many of the films this movie `` spoofs '' including napoleon dynamite , when harry met sally , mr. and mrs. smith , hitch , my big fat greek wedding , the wedding planner , jerry maguire , sleepless in seattle , and how to lose a guy in 10 days and all of them are funnier than date movie . it really is pointless to spoof comedies . the writers do n't even reference date movies all the time . they reference king kong , lord of the rings , star wars , and it does n't work . even the so-so scary movie films have something to say about the films they are spoofing . not only was it terribly unfunny , it was sick . i like monty python and american pie but when a cat starts humping a decayed human torso i draw the line . the writers of this film also made epic movie . i saw date movie on dvd . i will not see epic movie ever or any other film made by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer . it is a sad time in our world and an extremely small part of that sadness is the fact that movies like these are made and make millions at the box office
