insulting there are good b movies and wretched ones ... this one is wretched with a capital w ... ... almost anything with casper in it other than `` starship troopers '' is usually horrible ... this film seemed ok i mean it has rod steiger and kim catrall in it ! ! ! i figured it would be a b movie and be `` fun '' but in the end its just baaaaad ... .its not witty like lost boys nor fun like `` john carpenter 's vampires '' ... ..the film tries too hard to be funny at times and shlocky when it comes off very amatuerish . simply this is just a real waste of money and time..
