oy vey . oh , dear ... this movie was an abomination . why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead ? i can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book 's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers . but honestly ... there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal . and the film design ! bleh ! maybe it would be appealing to 5-year-old girls ... but to me it looked garish , cheap , and ... really fake . the costuming was slightly better than our high school plays , and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated . i felt so much dumber after watching this movie . i feel like i need an iq test ... or a good book . speaking of good books , ella enchanted is one of my favorites . i do n't know why i thought of that book just now . i guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it ... but not much
