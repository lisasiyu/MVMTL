pieces of a puzzle ju-on the grudge is about a horrific murder that develops an un-rested spirit which rages in a small suburban house in japan . the movie constructs itself similar to a puzzled storyline as the movie developed through numerous storylines of the varying characters . for the most part , viewers can easily be confused in the flick , or bored , as it may seem a bit redundant . i thought the movie was well written and interesting in theory . in practice , the movie felt never-ending , and as it drew to a close , i felt betrayed . the movie was unfulfilled , as it never really explained a lot of questions i held at the end . one question that leaves me wondering is questioning whether it is a japanese custom to enter a house when no one answers . for those interested in asian horror , try tale of two sisters . this korean film has great cinematography and story line . it will leave you on edge and taken back at its close .
