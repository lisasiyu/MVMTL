'fear as subtle entertainment ' *plot revealed* an utterly worthless foray into english overbearance and haughtiness , this film marks hitchcock as a worthy propagandist and architect of 'fear as subtle entertainment ' in the pre-war 1930 's . working and financed by the ministry of propaganda in london to indoctrinate subordinate english audiences into supporting the rationale for the vilification of germany , hitchcock eases the tension by making this a `` comedy '' . wasting the first half on indulgent emptiness ( the scene at an austrian hotel where the boring brits are talking about cricket and drinking tea ) , he then goes on to flabbergast us with indecipherable montages that are the most rank and absurd creations , the fight scene in the baggage cart for example . his support for the upper brit classes is especially drab and tedious , meandering between hero worship and idolatry , not to mention the wooden acting of the actors . the story concerns a `` secretive plot '' about an old woman who has disappeared from a train traveling in the austrian alps , simplistic , innocuous even but hitchcock wants us to believe that it is a most urgent matter because a fluffy headed ingenue does n't want to think she imagined it all . of course , she will be the agent provocateur for exposing a nefarious plot by 'evil men ' . immature plot ? definately . banter , insipid and devoid of any vivacity , is exchanged between high brow english snobs in the most elusive way , bordering on reductio ad absurdum and yet they seem to be assured in figuring out what has transpired on the train . this is nourishment for those who ca n't think very well . the story continues until the stuffy , pretentious , oaf-like english on the train become diverted by bumbling and incompetent foreign agents in one of the most pathetic scenes ever in cinema , the brits , debating the attack itself for 5 minutes in proper english , sit there in front of open windows , with one gun and hold off 24 well armed foreign agents for 20 minutes . also in this scene , the 80 year old woman `` spy '' , jumps from the side and runs away into the forest just as easily , how 24 well armed foreign agents could be held from the train itself is a question any reasonable human can debate , or why they were even too stupid to see the old spy jump off . if you can believe in the superiority of british snobs , then you must believe in the idiocy of this whole conniving film . of course you can guess the ending , the woman falls in love with the english chap who helped her on the train , and england is saved and her glorious social structure remains intact , an utterly absurd film from a director who is a specialist in fear and suspicion during the paranoid 1930 's but most audiences will take this as merely a `` thriller '' instead of understanding its proper origin and purpose in ideology of propaganda .
