why ? this is a completely ridiculous and unrealistic movie . josie , at 25 , is still not over the fact that she was unpopular in high school , and whines for the entire movie . it 's unclear why any one likes her , espesially her teacher . it 's also hard to get over the fact that the teacher , beleiving that she is in high school , makes no attempt to hide his feelings . the final scenes tie nothing together and the issue of her betrail is not delt with . never been kissed is n't good as a silly unbeleivable comedy ; it 's both painful to watch and devoid of any redeaming qualities in its content
