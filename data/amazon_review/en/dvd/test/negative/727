not true to the book my twelve year old who read and loved the e. nesbit book five children and it hated this movie . i have also read the book , and the movie has very little in common with the original story . there is no eccentric uncle and cousin horace or secret door in the greenhouse . the children are not sent to the country because of the war . even the wishes the children make are not true to the book . my nine year old enjoyed the movie because she had not read the book . so , although it is pleasant , clean , family entertainment , i think e. nesbit would have been disappointed at the adaptation of her book . it seems to me that the producers of this movie merely plagiarized e. nesbit 's idea of five children and a sand fairy and then totally wrote their own story borrowing from c.s . lewis ' chronicle of narnia series
