do we really need movies like this ? from the opening line of `` bully '' ( in which 'marty ' explicitly mentions oral sex ) i knew i was n't going to like this film . thank goodness i saw it on hbo and did n't waste my money on a rental . once again , we have another movie about dysfunctional upper-middle-class white families , in which the kids are a bunch of spoiled , drug-abusing , potty-mouthed brats , with parents that are nothing more than over-indulgent , inneffectual , clueless dolts . wow , what a stretch for an `` indie '' film . although this movie is based on a novelized `` true '' story by reporter jim schutze , about a murder that took place in florida , the screenwriter and director seem only halfway interested into getting into the minds of the kids that committed this horrible crime , wasting the other half of the movie with scenes of gratuitous sex and full-frontal nudity that gives this movie the feel of a kiddie-porn flick that 's intended to appeal to [ ... ] . on top of that , the girl who instigated the murder was described in shutze 's book as chubby and plain , while the film makers took `` artistic license '' in their casting of cute , petite little rachel miner as lisa . i guess the director figured that a chubby girl could n't incite a good-looking young boy to kill for her , even though that 's what happened in the book ! or perhaps the film makers wanted a pretty-looking young girl for all the teeneie nudity the role required . at the of the sleaze-fest is a violent murder , and director larry clark is uncompromising in his portrayal of the brutality of the act . bobby ( the 'bully ' ) is reduced from a sadistic , foul-mouthed closet [ ... ] to a screaming baby , begging for his life as he is repeatedly stabbed . ultimately , his best friend marty cuts his throat . murder is a horrifying , messy act , and director clark gives you a bird's-eye view of what a real murder may look like . this 5 minute scene should be clipped and shown to any kid that 's considering committing such an awful act . it is truly hard to watch . other than that , the film is just trash . larry clark could have effectively made all of his points without all the graphic sex , nudity , dirty language , and the [ ... ] dildo scene in bobby 's bedroom . what hurts the film 's believeability even more is the stereotypical treatment of the kids ' parents as disconnected morons who act as unknowing enablers to these kids ' rotten lifestyles . liberal film-makers love to blame the parents , and not a pop culture environment that glorifies sex , drugs , and violence , teaching our kids disobedience , in spite of all that parents try to do to counteract this onslaught . the 5 minute scene portrying the murder of bobby kent should be used as part of a 'scared straight ' program for wanna-be gangsters . the rest of the movie belongs in the dumpster .
