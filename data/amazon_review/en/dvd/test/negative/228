horrendous clive barker did a good job on the original candyman . it was truly a cut above most horror movies . the second movie was medicore at best in my opinion but this one was just horrendous . there is no suspense at all in this movie and the acting is deplorable . donna d'errico is soft on the eyes but too bad she talks . lets hope this is the last sequel
