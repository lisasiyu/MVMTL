worst bond movie ? apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film , but when i re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so , i found it to be . . . well , nearly unwatchable . what 's so bad about it ? well , how shall i begin . . . ( 1 ) sean connery is a dud . there can be very little doubt that connery is the james bond , but here , he seems like he 's just going through the motions . to be fair , he had no decent material to play . the only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007 ; he seems suitably worn-out at various points , and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before . but these are grace notes ; by and large , connery is stiff as a board here . ( 2 ) the action scenes are uninspiring . i 'm not the biggest fan of the roger moore bond films , but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes . here , the action is strictly second-rate . ( 3 ) kim basinger and barbara carrera , though great to look at , give terrible performances . ( 4 ) there is literally no reason to see this in favor of `` thunderball , '' of which it is a remake ; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments , and this remake makes zero improvements . in fact , the plot merely becomes muddled . ( 5 ) there are a series of awful performances in supporting roles . rowan atkinson 's comic scenes , though brief , are painfully unfunny , not to mention out of place . the actor playing the `` new '' m is odious ; and whoever it is playing q is n't very good , either . ( 6 ) the music is bad . the title song is boring , and the score by michel legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a bugs bunny cartoon . i could n't care less that the james bond theme is missing ; it 's not what is n't there that 's bad , it 's what is there . all in all , i 'd have to say that -- unless we 're counting the 1967 version of `` casino royale '' -- this is the worst of the james bond movies . it 's worth seeing if you 've never seen it before . . . but that 's about it , in my opinion
