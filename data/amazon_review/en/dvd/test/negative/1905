not what i expected from other reviews ... i do n't know alot about old movies , especially not silent film , or anything before the 40 's , so maybe my opinion is that of a dummy . most of the shots were very long , repetitive , and boring . it was rare for a scene to have much editing at all , it was mostly a single shot showing frantic action that does n't tell much of a story at all . the woman who reads the text screens is obnoxious . in my opinion , i 'd rather read it myself than have it read to me . i do n't like that voice there . as some of the other reviewers have said , some of the effects and costuming worked very well . very impressive for the time . the direction , action , and pacing/storytelling just did n't seem to work well at all for me . very slow . i fell asleep several times and had to rewind . if you want a good silent film , check out steamboat bill , jr . excellent
