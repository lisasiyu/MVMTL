dissappointed ! shortcut to nirvana : if you are looking for the sensational aspect of mystic india , this is perhaps a good movie to watch . i was dissappointed ! this film fails to capture the spiritual intent and solemnity of the kumbh mela . pilgrims eagerly look forward this rare festival for spiritual reasons ! these `` other diversions '' are meant to inspire us to move beyond the material limitations . the story line of the film was weak and failed to inspire many of those who watched it with me
