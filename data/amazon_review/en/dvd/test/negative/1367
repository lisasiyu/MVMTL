strangely sterile , a troubling nightmare of forsaken femininity . this is a movie that got universally bad reviews . it helped knowing that going in because my expectations were very low . being a fan of angelina jolie , i was not disappointed in her performance . despite a thin plot and cheesy effects , angelina delivered her lines with class and finesse . unfortunately even her talent can not overide an overall lack of plot and unbelievable situations . the film grew tiresome very quickly . on a jungian level this film portrays a strange sterility . the first scene is lara upside down , in the middle of a training exercise set by her computer nerd flunkie and her all-purpose butler . this opening segment defined the problem for the film -- someone who is not grounded and unconscious . lara raids tombs and fights bad guys to no real purpose -- except perhaps to pit her skills against someone else . this cycle repeats endlessly , as do video games , which create a feeling of accomplishment where there is none , sterile endeavors with no learning and no personal or interpersonal gain . the individual does not develop -- just the skills . lara steals the ancient wealth of civilizations from tombs , co-opting heritage and treasure for the love of the game . this disregard for cultural artifacts except as an exercise is indicative of lack of depth and insight . in one moment in the movie , there is a clear symbol of the futility of this lifestyle -- lara puts everything aside to retrieve a memento of her dead father . but then she reverts to form . in addition there is no mention of her mother -- what happened to her and why is this not a loss ? obviously this is such a deficit it can not be referred to except obliquely by one scene where an enormous statue of a woman is destroyed , and by the total lack of other women in the film . overall a troubling nightmare of forsaken femininity
