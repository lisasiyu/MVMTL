1 star for universal 's piss poor transfer to dvd this show is my all time favorite , however universal has gone and dicked it up by leaving out various sound effects and a teaser , and a wrong season premier intro ! dvd is meant to bring out the best in media , not the worst , how could they lose sound effects ? unbelievable ! just does n't seem possible ... season 4 is no better ... universal please read this and re-release season 3 and 4 already , the fans are extremely pissed off !
