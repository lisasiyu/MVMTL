silly and cheap dino-flick from the director of 'commando' somewhere in turkey , there is a forest where you may be attacked by man-eating flying monsters living in the dormant volcano nearby . to this place come one american professor who needs to publish a paper , one graduate student as assistant ( and love interest ) , and four na√Øve undergraduates who just want to get their degree from college . deep in this forest , moreover , a group of terrorists are hiding , and the us special force is sent to capture their leader in order to bring back him alive . ( but do american college students need to fly all the way to turkey to graduate ? travel financed by one of the rich student 's daddy ? ) part of this impossible scenario sounds like that of `predator , ' but in this film it is the titular dinosaur `pterodactyl ' - no , in fact , pterodactyls , to be precise - that attack the hapless special unit . unlike arnold schwarzenegger classic , however , the creatures in `pterodactyl ' only bore you to death because of their cheesy cgi and dull and uninspired action scenes that always begin when there is nothing to talk about in the story . the film is not scary , nor exciting even with occasional gore , and when the flying pterodactyls look like big bats that you might see on video games , what can you expect from the rest of the film 's 90 minutes ? coolio is the captain of the special unit , and his acting itself is not bad . but at the same time , i am afraid , not many people would find the idea of coolio vs. predacious monsters intriguing , and the results are exactly what you expect from the ill-judged combination . the other actors are not great either , but with this bad story and dialogues , and most of all very unconvincing creatures , none one can be blamed . the saddest thing is that the director is mark l. lester , who once did the underrated action film `commando ' back in 1985 with schwarzenegger . that was a ridiculous story , but i really liked the way schwarzenegger 's hero talked and behaved ( throwing a telephone booth ! ) . it was silly , but it was fun . `pterodactyl ' is silly , and tries to be fun , which you know it is not
