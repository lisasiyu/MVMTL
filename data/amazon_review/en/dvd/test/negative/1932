continuing the downward spiral of what was once a good franchise . dean winters , doing his best impression of ben affleck , stars in this , the sixth installment in the constantly withering `` hellraiser '' franchise . in `` hellraiser : hellseeker , '' his character , trevor gooden is married to good ol ' kirsty cotton , who we remember from the first three films . trouble is , she seemingly dies in a car wreck less than ten minutes into the movie and trevor has one massive headache trying to figure out what happened . let it be known that history does repeat itself . just like `` hellraiser iii : hell on earth '' and `` hellraiser : bloodline , '' this one takes the series further into shame and embarassment . it 's a direct-to-video sequel , but c'mon , we expect better than this . maybe `` hellseeker '' was a good script at some point , but when they decided to throw pinhead and kirsty into the mix , it got lost . see , these characters serve little to no purpose in the plot . they are just gimmicks , placed within a story to draw in viewers and feed off a legendary title . this is not a `` hellraiser '' movie . a healthy chunk of it just adds up to a sub-standard psychological thriller , nothing else . in fact , pinhead and kirsty hardly come into play until the final 15 minutes , which feel like a remake of the original movie . i like to think i have an open mind when it comes to movies , and horror in particular . but this movie is a joke . the producers obviously masked an incomplete script to pass it off as a `` hellraiser '' movie ( ala `` american psycho 2 '' ) and should n't think for one second that we ca n't tell the difference . the end result is full of plot-holes , loose ends , inconsistencies , etc . etc . if you can make any sense out what you saw or if you can even call it a movie at the very end , you 're a better person than me
