poor jayne , what a waste ! the las vegas hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars jayne mansfield , mamie van buren and ferlin huskey . it appears to be a low budget film due to the photography , acting and settings . if you are a jayne or mamie fan , you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only . one highlight of the film is ferlin husky 's dream sequence of jayne singing `` that makes it . '' air time of jayne is very small . trivia : the siamese cat in the film , which jayne is holding , belonged to jayne 's friend may mann .
