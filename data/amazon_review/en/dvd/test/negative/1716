kind of aimless i found this movie somewhat entertaining , although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun . unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention , and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting , makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience . nevertheless , the film is about a whole host of young people , dressed up and heading for a party ( ostensibly martha plimpton 's party ) , but they never quite make it there . plimpton , someone i never really cared for , is actually rather funny in this role , and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party ( and her idol , elvis costello ) . christina ricci and gaby hoffman are both quite funny ; courtney love , paul rudd and janeane garofalo are also quite a trio . overall this is light comedy ; nothing special but still worth the effort .
