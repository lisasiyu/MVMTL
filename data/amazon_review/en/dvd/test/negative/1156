watch `` the bird with the crystal plummage '' giallo instead . i waited ages to get this fulci classic and now i wished i did not . it is probably fulci 's most confusing work to date and lacks all known production standards considering this is film # 33 from him . i can buy giallo being a bit spaced out and highly far-fetched , but this one is just plain bad from start to finish , it is only really remembered for the infamous woman chain whipping sequence ( chain whipping also appeared in `` the beyond '' ; fulci loved cashing in on all this stuff ) , `` do n't torture a duckling '' is completely void of substance , mystery or crime and instead is replaced by everything that is camp about film making , from the obvious papermashy heads to the `` shall i stand here and act now '' type blemish on everyone 's face , considering this is fulci 's 33rd film or thereabouts , it really looks like his first and it would be another 8 years before he made horror , i was expecting a somewhat smart giallo and got drawn out rubbish instead . like i said - watch `` the bird with the crystal plummage '' giallo instead . it was made by argento two years before this and is where you should be at instead . i would recommend that argento 'primative slasher ' over fulci 's cash crop schlock `` do n't torture a duckling '' any day of the week
