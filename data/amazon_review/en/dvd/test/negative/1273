feedback from real apache `` calculus wiz '' i saw a few scenes and could n't even continue watching . i like a lot of charles bronson 's movies . examples include `` death hunt , '' the 80s `` death wish '' series , and `` the white buffalo . '' but his acting in this movie is unrealistic . he does not act like a real apache . bronson seems to overdo it on being `` stoic . '' a relative and i watched a few scenes and just switched channels . bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real apache . paul newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an apache-raised white man in `` hombre , '' which i purchased on amazon . i do applaud bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the 1880s . given the time period , perhaps bronson should have hired roman gabriel instead . he does a realistic job of portraying a cherokee indian in the `` undefeated , '' which was also released around the same time ( give or take a couple of years )
