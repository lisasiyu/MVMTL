i can barely hear chuck i have to contradict the other review . i thought it was shot fine , but the sound was not good . moe is a two guitar band and i believe the strength of the band is the way the two guitar players play off each other . on the dvd , al is real loud , but chuck 's guitar is almost completely inaudible . this is a real big disappointment to me . i really like moe , but i would not recomend this dvd except for those who have to have it . it 's a real shame
