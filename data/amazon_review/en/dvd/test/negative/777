do n't waste ur money buying this would not make sense if you a . bought batman the animated series : volume one or b. batman tas the legend begins . if you have one or the other and hopefully not conned by warner to buy both and think you would want this then you would have 2 and if ur that rare case of ones who bought both a. and b. then you would have 3 christmas ' with joker . now i would urge you to buy volume one and later 2 then to go question yourself if you have this episode and why is this episode on both dvd 's . be safe and read before you buy
