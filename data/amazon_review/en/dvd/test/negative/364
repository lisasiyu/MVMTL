mind numbingly boring repetition after seeing the first series , i thought ( hoped ) that intelligence had started to find it 's way back to humor . with the second series , i see that i was wrong . horribly wrong . in the former , we were introduced to these characters , and with each new scene , a new quirk or tidbit was released to us . in the latter , there is no development at all . it is formulaic . the characters basically do the same thing , again and again , without even much of a change in scenery . messrs. walliams and lucas do not challenge themselves to broaden these individuals in the least , which i find all the more egregious because they have an unerring eye for detail . perhaps the grind of a series is too much for them . it certainly seems that they have stopped caring . if you like to `` parrot '' characters verbatim , play drinking games by shouting out what 's coming next in a scene , or find that you 've been attracted to saturday night live post 1979 , you might like this . i was acutely disappointed
