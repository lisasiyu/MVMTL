comedic one minute , insulting the next i never thought movie criminals could be dumber than the ones in `` dead presidents , '' but the kidnapping-for-drug-money plan in this movie was absolutely worse . as soon as i saw where this movie was going , i just shook my head and watched the idiots go ( i 'm talking about the characters -- not the real actors ) . this movie was pretty silly to me . timberlake was an absolutely terrible thug , and two people had forewarned me of this , but i figured i 'd see for myself . every time i heard him curse and glanced at his tattoos , i laughed louder . his friends were even more entertaining ; a bunch of suburban kids who thought being kidnapped was cool ; a guy so high out of his mind that he did n't realize up from down ; and the ransom kid who was so excited to be in a `` criminal '' scene that he completely seemed to forget he was in danger . i do n't know where the movie stores will put this one when it comes out on sale , but it really should go into the comedy section . the scene where they go `` buddy , buddy , buddy '' made my stomach hurt from laughing at that goofiness . i 'm sure that 'll be copied off of in high schools everywhere . the thing is that the actual plot of the story ( with different actors and without the druggies ) would 've been great ; but the people who played the roles were absolutely so out of touch to the point where it looked like i was watching a vanilla ice video , or something close to it . i would 've given it more stars if the movie was meant to be a parody on drug dealing , but from the previews , it sounds like the company was going for a drama . cons : i could 've gone without hearing the constant racial slurs in this movie . it annoys me when people of the culture say it ; so it definitely annoyed the hell out of me to hear several characters use certain words . i did n't find that at all funny .
