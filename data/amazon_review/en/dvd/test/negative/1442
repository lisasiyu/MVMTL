hornblower was not a defiant jerk ... . as a hornblower fan for many decades , i am very disappointed in this movie . ioan gruffud portrays a hornblower who is almost a modern high school delinquent - the kind who walks in front of your car when you drive near a public hs to show he is `` cool '' or a `` big man '' . whereas this may appeal to someone who sports a `` question authority '' sticker , it is not the hornblower i know . overall , it seems that the movies did not do too well with one of the greatest heroes of fiction - but at least gregory peck 's hornblower was decent - this one is not quite the material from which a commodore hornblower is made ... the kind of person portrayed by gruffud is , above all , childish ( as we all know , `` cool '' is the same as `` cute '' ) . perhaps the other ones with this ioan gruffud are better , but these two are bad enough that they keep me from buying the others
