not for everyone if your main objective , is the study of human relationships , social rapports between humans , and conquering and seducing other people , this movie is for you . not an embarrassing movie , at all , for any of the actors . just , a nutty story , and enfatuation of the author of the script with people , relationships , seduction , etc . this is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant . not true . just that , perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more fun for some people than others
