if you want the real deal go region 2 i 'm amazed that the us still has to put up with this half baked rush release , if you want the fully realised package with english sound track from the usual cast then get the region two version isbn b000by9alu . ok so it 'll probably cost you twice as much and you 'll need a multi region player . but for something this good why put up with second best . this is one of those films where the brain really needs to be turned on , as treating it like a popcorn movie will leave you dazed and confused . it continues the theme from gits 1 querying the boundaries between man and machine and the dangers of ghost hacking . at times it gets a touch pretentious with batou and togusa swapping obscure quotations , but it is both beautiful and thought provoking . again a split review 5 for the film , 2 for the slipshod dvd release
