paxil or percocet might have been better ... this movie is not grand on a the memoirs scale of `` grande '' to me ... there are better . i ca n't really understand why these flicks of `` female depression memoirs '' are becoming so popular lately ... i could pull my hair out watching the tension and angst of anjolina jolie and brittany murphy in `` girl interrupted '' , but not in `` prozac nation '' . for one , christina ricci does not do anything for me as an actress . yes , she looks cool in that moby video , but really ... she is just a bug-eyed over-hyped former `` goth actress '' -she could star in `` memoirs of winona from beetlejuice '' . anyway , that said , ricci at least gets the roll right aesthetically-she has her pants tightly rolled at her ankles , dons the heavy black plastic bangles and rolls her eyes on cue . i can give her credit for these efforts . she brings out the worst of the 80 's -enough shoulder padding to drive anyone to prozac . what i really dislike is the idea that this book or movie captures a `` new '' idea . i think the dvd would be a better `` after school special '' . it does n't thrill me or make me feel moved to be a better person . i ca n't find anything in the script that says `` i am different from most young women 's lives at college '' . plenty of talented , smart women make mistakes in college-many abuse drugs , sleep with all the wrong men , and hate their mothers-this one wrote a book and sold it to a publisher . where is the taboo here ? where are the revelations so terrible i need to peek through my fingers just to absorb them slowly ? even `` prozac '' is n't tied into the movie physically until the end . there really is nothing here-just a diary with so-so actors playing out the roles .
