not for die-hard fans ! ! if you are a fan of the original empire records , do n't buy the re-mixed fan version ... it 's a big dissappointment . there are added scenes in the movie , and some of the best lines are changed . example : when rex is leaving the store and says `` why do n't you all just fade away . '' yeah , he does n't say that in this version . i was very dissappointed when i saw this , b/c die-hard empire fans do n't want the best lines changed , so this really is n't a `` fan re-mix '' b/c it changes stuff the fans love ! ! ! definitely just buy the regular dvd or vhs version ... it 's much better as an original , not a re-mix ! ! !
