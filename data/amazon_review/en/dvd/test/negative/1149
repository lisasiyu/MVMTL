hip hop documentary ? ? ! ? ? straight from the streets wasn`t what i expected . if you ask me this isn`t even a documentary about hip hop , more a documentary on black people . on this dvd you have a lot of black people talkin how they shouldn`t fight amongst each other , how they should unite and stuff like that . besides the interviews with ice t and the low rider show this dvd has nothing to offer . it is not a hip hop documentary , if you want a hip hop documentary on dvd , buy rhyme & amp ; reason
