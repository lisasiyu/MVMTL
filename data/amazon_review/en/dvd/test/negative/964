really unfunny movie , baby ! boy , was this a disappointment . the curmudgeon was a big fan of the first movie , a clever parody of bond movies , but it seems the ol ' creative and comic barrel had ran empty this time around . god knows what drivel they put out for the third film - i was not tempted to see that . so what 's the problem ( s ) ? well , for one - austin powers . he 's just not funny in this , in fact he 's just downright annoying . once the scenes begin to go on you realise just how much of a 2-d character he really is . no-one expects a fully realised emotional character , but a little range and depth would work wonders . you can actually see myers struggling as the movie continues . we 'll pass by the unfunny names which were covered in the opening review , and talk about dr evil . the best character in the first ( and still in this ) has also been spoiled - maybe it 's too much of him or.. i dunno . oh , wait - yes i do . they have him rap . nice one mike - let 's make a character do something he would never do for the sake of a cheap laugh . yeah , it 's a comedy , but even characters should have limits and contexts , and dr evil was just ruined after that . mini-me is a failure , his only contributions are giving the finger to people . oh , my sides . plus , when you add in fat bastard , a tedious `` baby-eater '' with myers horrific attempt at a scottish accent , you are n't so much rolling in the aisles as charging up them towards the exit . this movie would probably have scored two stars , but i 'm deducting another for all the idiots who thought it original and amusing to say `` grooooooovy baby '' etc and think they were the king of comedy . hey , my reviews my rules
