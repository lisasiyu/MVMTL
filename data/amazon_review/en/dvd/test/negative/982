not worth the time and money ... overall a bad buy ! horrible dvd mastering with menus that never fully load and buttons that do n't work . the movie has a couple of really funny extra clips in it , but nothing really `` finished . '' the extended scenes are n't scored , which is really distracting because i could n't stop thinking about the great `` mondo bongo '' song that should have been there during the alternate ending , et al ! do n't bother with this one ... check out the directors cuts of `` kingdom of heaven '' ( amazing ! ) and `` king arthur '' - they 're both very worthwhile
