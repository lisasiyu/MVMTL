great music ; horrible dvd ! most people writing reviews for this dvd are focusing on the music and performances which i agree are great but unfortunately the dvd which i am reviewing was lousy . the editing was extremely ridiculous . you would be hard-pressed to find an instance of an image that lasted more than a second . it was more like 5 per second ( ok that may be a slight -- very slight -- exaggeration ) . this a trend in concert video editing that is evident here in the nth degree . terrible ! the images come at you like a machine gun . please support this band by buying their cds but unless you have the attention span of a 3-year old on speed skip this dvd
