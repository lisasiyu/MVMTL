great cartoons , bad dvd i 'm impressed that disney is comming to their senses and putting out this old vintage stuff on dvd , i remember this series from when i was a young kid , i originally said in the review for `` chip n dale rescue rangers '' that these dvd 's are not worth it because i only liked the theme song but now i changed my mind . the animation is superb , the story is wonderful , and some of the characters ( cubbi and sunni ) are cute ! i 'm not happy because all they had on the dvd were episiodes of the tv series only no bonus features whatsoever , not even interviews with the original voice actors , i know bill scott is dead but june foary is still around along with corey burton . disney this is still your property please treat it with respect !
