what a pity ! i hope people do n't start to think of this movie as alien 5 . in my mind this is a whole new venture , one that is separate from any of the work that sigourney weaver did on the first four alien films . the first 4 films are pretty good and i really like the whole series . it works rather well and i would love to see another alien film with sigourney in it . i think they could pull off one more film . ripley 's a great hero . this movie was pretty bad . the only reason i give it 2 stars is because of the special effects . i felt like i was watching a scooby doo version of alien . whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money . the plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent . each of the first four alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of sigourney 's involvement . this one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair .
