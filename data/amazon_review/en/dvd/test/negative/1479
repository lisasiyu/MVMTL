greatly disappointed well i loved the book by joseph heller even though it can be hard to follow at times . the movie , however , was a huge let down . i did not expect it to be as good as the book , nothing ever is , but this was just bad . the cast sounds great , but the acting too over the top if you ask me . especially arkin as yossarian , he just annoyed me . there were many characters i came to like while reading , but this movie does n't give you a chance to like any of them . so much of the book is left out , which is to be expected , but it does n't make any sense if you have n't read it . the anti-war commentary is almost completely lost and it has basically been turned into a comedy . overall this was a terrible movie , especially considering how good the book was . it gets two starts simply for being associated with the book . do n't waste your money , just read the book
