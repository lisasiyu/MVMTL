bad , bad , bad i never , and i repeat : never walk out on a movie , but when this garbage came out in the theater i was out the door in 30 minutes or less , i was glad my tickets were for free . however , my time was not . it was so stupid and totally off-balance that i have made it personal mission to validate how bad this movie is.if gangster movies is your thing please watch `` the untouchables '' or something equally cool . still have it on my list as the top 5 `` so bad that it is bad '' movies of all time . some movies get the coveted `` so bad that is good '' title ... this is not one of them . garbage .
