desperate acts i wo n't give a long drawn out account on why this movie was bad for me , but one thing sticks out in my mind . the characters tried too hard to me . i love sanna latham , but it seems like she was forcing herself to convince us that she was really romantically involved with wesley snipes . with all the ups and downs of their relationship , i was praying that they just chalk the relationship up as a loss and move on . after awhile it just get tiring , you know , like a real relationship . i much prefer the book . this movie does n't hold a candle to the book . the book is as real as it gets . pretty much how things are today
