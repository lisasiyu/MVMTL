poor quality piece , but ... i was extremely disappointed with this dvd , in both content and quality . i expected a wider range of archival video footage from his preformances and some selections are in fact taken from same performances . fourteen live performace songs is an extreme understatement of his ability to capture his audiences , be it for a television broadcast or live concert . the anthology is padded with distracting talking head video footage taken from the documentary and the fades between frames were less then desired . but ... the `` bonus '' documentary was redeeming . `` half mile a day '' is definitely the stronger half of this dvd ; perhaps the documentary should in fact be the primary material with the anthology being the `` bonus '' selection . i ranked this dvd at two stars because i purchased it for the performance footage and not the documentary
