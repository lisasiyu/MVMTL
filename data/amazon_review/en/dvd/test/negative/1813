upscaled dvd at best ! ! ! high hopes were set in place for this blu-ray release , and i have to admit i am sadly dissapointed . the transfer is only a 'fraction ' above watching a sd dvd version upscaled , which is a real shame . buy at your own risk , or wait for a much better release , hopefully director 's cut , remastered and all . 2.5/5 for effort . -zallap
