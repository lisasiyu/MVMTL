not even worth it at these prices i wasted my money to watch cdeb 1 . ) try but fail to carry a full concert with only himself 2 . ) see the camera repeatedly zero in on a touched fan in the audience ... who happens to be part of cdeb 's marketing organization 3 . ) try to convince everyone that he irons his own shirts and is not a rich snob . chris deburgh , i 'm a fan of your music and lyrics , please stop cheating your fans out of their money for sub-standard products as this one ... now i know why it was so affordable ... but you dont even get what you pay for on this one..
