hahahaha ... what a `` deep '' plot ! this movie is only good for those that `` love '' alyssa milano . plot ? it is n't non-existent . it does exist but it 's a complete crap ! period . just an excuse to show skin . regarding the dvd , it 's a barebones one but picture and audio quality is as good as most new line cinema releases , anamorphic and stuff , plus it 's the best release of the movie if we compare it with releases in other regions . you wo n't be disappointed in that aspect
