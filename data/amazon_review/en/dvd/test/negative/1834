not the best disney movie ever made but ... . i 'm a big fan of disney movies , and sappy-ness does n't bother me , but this was off the scales corny . not much story , too much dancing around . kind of chilidish for grownups and hard for kids to understand some of it , as it 's mostly about politics , so it kind of gets lost in the middle . buddy ebsen , though , gives his usual stellar performance , and kurt russel and goldie hawn appear in the movie together and met on the set for the 1st time !
