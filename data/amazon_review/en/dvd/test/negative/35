where is the wolf ? just horrendous ! with the new year just more than six hours away , i must tell you that no matter a full moon , half moon , quarter moon , or no moon at all , please avoid the flick `` darkwolf '' for many moons to come . what a joke . what a silly , stupid , insult to one 's intelligence . the script could have been written by my dog stan ... and even then , i give him the benefit of the doubt to come up with something much more canine . let 's put it this way . have you ever seen a film that contained people that irritated you so much , you simply did n't give a ^ & ^ % * if they got blown away ? i was hoping the entire cast got mulched by mr. wolf less that 30 minutes into this loser . go `` darkwolf '' . take a few chucks out of this cast , its director , producer , writer and editors as quickly as possible ... and do n't wait until the next full moon . `` darkwolf '' is an insult to motion pictures . more so , it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as `` the wolf man '' , `` wolfen '' and `` the howling '' , not to mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic `` an american werewolf in london '' . need i say more ? `` darkwolf '' has no bite . it 's claws and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion . the box claims this flick to be `` half man . half wolf . pure evil . '' in reality it is half/whole stupid . half/whole worthless . ... and ... pure ^ % & * ! get my drift ? at midnight ... as we turn another page and the new year unfolds ... i promise you you will enjoy reruns of every episode of `` mary hartman , mary hartman '' , much more than `` darkwolf '' . i 'm off to watch yet another new year 's flick before dawn . i need to make amends to lon chaney , jr. before midnight . bottom line , it was a film you did n't really care `` where '' the `` wolf '' came from , or where the werewolf was going . pitiful ... embarrassing ... '' i 've seen the bad moon rising '' but this one makes me wish it would set !
