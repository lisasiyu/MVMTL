yawn ! has nobody seen through scorseses weak plots yet ? he makes one exellent gangster film ( goodfellas which after all was based on a book ) then repeats the same formula for almost every other film . so we have the italian mafia in goodfellas , the jewish mafia in once upon a time , back to the italians but change location for casino and now we have the irish and 'native ' mafia . so what next for scorsese when he runs out of ethnic groups for his mafia films ? this film lacks everything . loosely based on historical facts its slow , dull and only made vaguely interesting by the odd input of horrific violence ( just as all of his gangster films are , the start of goodfellas , the baseball bat scene in casino etc ) sorry but this film lacks everything .
