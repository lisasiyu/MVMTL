disappointed after reading the reviews from pbs i was excited to see the film . im so happy i rented it as opposed to getting it from here , which i would have done had i not found it somewhere else . while all the teachers had great intentions , it was obvious they were not equipped with the skills needed to engage the children in a community/learning environment . from observing body language and facial expressions in some of the classes , the children were not engaged ( notice how they lit up when they were finally engaged through the photo project ! ) . the answers to questions about behavior were the answers that the teachers wanted to hear and the teachers knew it . if they watched the video , i hope they would take not at how they talked to the students ( a couple teachers in particular ) . getting angry , answering your own question , making students write why they wont misbehave anymore , etc . are old school ways of gaining compliance and they wont reach todays children . this video would not make me want to be a teacher , if anything , it shows just how much preservice teachers need to be exposed to various cultures , they need to learn how to build a community in the classroom , and they need mentors who are aware of the needs of diverse learners . in order to attract students to a profession , make a video that highlights teachers who are able to make a difference despite the odds , schools that have made drastic turnarounds , and students who excel when they should be another negative statistic . there are some positive things in the video , they are just overshadowed by the other stuff . and , yes , i agree with a previous writer . another video could have been used in the classroom to expose students to the lives of homosexuals
