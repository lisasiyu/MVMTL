hindsight is 20/20 believe it or not , i actually wanted to watch this movie . i 've seen almost everything else adrian lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts . ( i watched _jacob 's ladder_ because i remembered an intriguing preview on a vhs cassette i watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _silent hill_ sealed the deal ; my girlfriend owns a copy of lyne 's version of _lolita_ ; _fatal attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental ; i watched the tv version of _indecent proposal_ ; i have n't seen _9 1/2 weeks_ but i read the book . ) flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you 've never seen it . and i always wanted to hear the song `` maniac '' in its original context , so when i found it on an acquaintances shelf i popped it in . so , how was it ? not too bad . not great by any means , or even really that good ( _lolita_ and _jacob 's ladder_ are both quite good ) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work . the plot is a by-the-book `` believe in your dreams '' story with really lame dialog , but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like i was watching an abstract silent film . i do n't know squat about dancing , but the choreography seemed innovative , at least for its time . i ca n't even remember the names of the characters , but all in all , i have to admit that it was kind of neat . also , if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind , _flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from hollywood : it 's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials , one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack joe esterhasz and was produced by jerry bruckheimer ! taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60 % of all crap movies made since
