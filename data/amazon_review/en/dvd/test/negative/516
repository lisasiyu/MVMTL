`` you 're going down burnhead '' ? ? ? i have to say that i was not familiar with any darkman comics , or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so i can not compare the character to other sources . therefore , coming from someone that did not `` know '' darkman prior to the film i have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment ! there are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies , like the shadow , batman etc , which is interesting . nevertheless , darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast : liam neeson , larry drake , and frances mcdormand among others . it is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement . in an effort to exact revenge , he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims ... . in short , the acting and the plot are average ( nothing great ) , while the dialogues are way below average . the movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category . the characters are , overall , bland and just plain uninteresting ( e.g . rick anderson played by the `` fool , '' ted raimi , from the xena series ) . though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off . a shame really ... in a nutshell , it 's not a movie you would want to add to your collection , but it might provide for an evening 's entertainment , and that 's about it . no masterpiece here ... 2 stars
