watch you talking about willis ? the story of the strokes is the story of wealth and privilege , and its endless amounts of free time to be arty and practice trying to act like lou reed and vu riffs . this was made without rca , and so lacks strokes music . the band apparently wanted nothing to do with it , it is practically diy , with no interviews . this just shows what a bunch of brats they are not to support this project . their 2nd album sucked anyway
