waste of a talented cast what a disappointment . every single character in this film is depressed , mentally ill , and self-absorbed . no one is sane or sympathetic . therefore , there 's no one to identify with or root for . no one gets better or grows as a person . so what 's the point ? annette benning gives a strong performance , but her character is vapid and self-pitying . not worth two hours of your life
