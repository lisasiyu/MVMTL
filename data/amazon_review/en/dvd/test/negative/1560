heavy-handed and sluggish conrad adaptaion ( see 'sabotage ' ) 'secret agent ' ( 1996 ) stars very strong cast -- bob hoskins ( also ex-producer ) , patricia arquatte , christian bale , gerard depardieu , jim broadbent , eddie izzard , and uncredited robin williams . the music score is philip glass , and the director is christopher hampton , who made 'carrington ' before this one . so the film should be better than average classic novel adaptaions , which it is n't . this conrad adaptation is sluggish , not knowing what it really wants to show . one great disadventage is that we have seen the adaptation of this joseph conrad novel before -- hitchcock 's 'sabotage ' ( 1936 ) starring sylvia sydney . ( not to be confused with the same director 's film named 'secret agent . ' ) this version , not perfect to be sure , knows what it is doing , for the master of suspence turned it into a spy story with a thrilling sequence about a bomb hidden in a bag carried by an innocent boy . however , the new version , though it is more faithful to the original novel , and proud of its great cast , has no sense of what it really is doing . the film opens quite promisingly , with bob hoskins ' verloc , a shopkeeper in 1890s london , who actually is a spy in the pay of russian embassy . he is summoned by the russain ambassador ( very good eddie izzard ) , who tells verloc to demolish one symbolic building in britain with a bomb , the building which represents 'time ' ( you know where ) . so far , interesting . but as if to imitate the original novelist 's slow moving narrative , the film unwisely introduces many flashbacks that tell us the outcomes of the botched plans . yes , conrad uses ( intentionally or not , i do not know ) the confused narrative that seems to have lost the sense of coherent chronological order ( read 'nostromo ' ) . hampton not only employs this flashback method once , but twice ( ! ) to show how mrs. verloc ( miscast arquatte ) meets her fate . so irritating . the production designs are excellent , the acting is good all in all -- jim broadbent as police inspector and robin williams as the professor around whose body a bomb is strapped are memorable among them -- and philip glass provides good socre . however , all is wasted or misused , and even glass 's music starts to sound repetitious . the film uses it when there is no need , and that is really annoying . i like the atmosphere , and i do n't think joseph conrad is a difficult material to make a film out of it ( see 'victory ' made the year before ) . but christopher hampton as director , though good as screenwriter , seems to have killed the material with heavy-handed direction . and its characters that should be more interesting with a smooth story , too .
