still a rookie richard pryor is my all-time favorite stand-up comedian . i consider him the best in the business . but his performance in & quot ; live and smokin & quot ; shows he 's still just a rookie . he 's nervous in front of the camera , and says so several times . his material is typically raunchy , but not very funny . you can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience . buy this tape only if you 're a die-hard pryor fan , but do n't expect the side-splitting laughter you 'll get from & quot ; in concert & quot ; , & quot ; live on the sunset strip & quot ; , and & quot ; here and now & quot ;
