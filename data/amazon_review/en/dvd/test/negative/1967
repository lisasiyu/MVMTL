yow ! this is the film that could easily have tanked the career of lesser mortals , but the mighty jane fonda continued acting in six or seven subsequent films until 1992 , when she married ted turner and her film career ended rather abruptly . kris kristofferson is simply awful/laugable in his role as a wall street troubleshooter . do n't look for this mess to be released on dvd anytime soon , unless it becomes a camp favorite . this film tries to be a potboiler , but it ends up being a soap opera with the world economy as a backdrop . it 's one establishing shot after another , and the actual consequences of any actual conflict are too abstract for anyone to care about . fonda and kristofferson must have been embarrassed at this thing . it 's just a sheer waste of two good actors . the plotline is so paper thin that even a kid in second grade would find it to be implausible . in fact , here 's a script for a story that i wrote in about three minutes , which would have made more sense : `` heroes of the stratosphere '' by thomas redmond after taxiing down an airport runway near san clemente , california , jane fonda and kris kristofferson take off in a badly-maintained twin engine biplane with jane fonda piloting . at 6,000 feet , jane decides to put the plane through its paces , and begins performing aerial stunts like barrel rolls and steep power dives . unfortunately , the airplane is not in very good shape and after about ten minutes , part of the left wing flies off . `` hey ! , '' yells kristofferson . `` hey , yourself ! , '' yells fonda , coyly . `` yow ! , '' replies kristofferson . at that point , fonda manuevers the biplane into a tailspin , and kristofferson flies out of his seat , into the air and begins to fall to earth without a parachute . then , in an attempt to save kristofferson by scooping him into the navigator 's seat , fonda puts the plane into a steep dive but is unable to rescue the hapless kris because of the damaged left wing . fonda ends up crashing the airplane into a lake near the dupont estate near wilmington , delaware about a half an hour after takeoff . somehow , both kris and jane emerge from the experience unscathed . later on the two are reunited and they get married and live happily ever after . the end
