tobe hooper ? richard matheson ? masters of horror ? what happened ? ? one of the most eagerly awaited episodes in showtime 's masters of horror series , dance of the dead is sadly disappointing . now granted , it 's been a long time since tobe hooper , the craftsman behind the legendary texas chainsaw massacre , has done anything remotely spectacular , but the potential was here . based on a great story by i am legend author richard matheson ( and adapted by his son , richard christian matheson ) , dance of the dead revolves around a mad max-ish post-apocalyptic future in which a sheltered girl ( jessica lowndes ) gets in with a bad boy ( a beefed-up jonathan tucker , from the 2003 re-make of texas chainsaw massacre ) who does work for the mc ( genre icon robert englund ) of a club that does some very different performances than you would expect , only to learn a shocking truth about her family . what 's the most disappointing here is hooper 's techniques , which are quite a number of quick flashes , edits , and cuts ; which were most likely done to give the story a tripped out feel , but only distract the viewer . not to mention that a majority of the cast are so bad delivering some truly atrocious dialogue ( lowndes and tucker are the only ones who do n't seem to be sleepwalking ) that the episode has an overly campy feel to it , and the music ( allegedly by smashing pumpkins frontman billy corgan ) is nu-metal drivel that is as derivative as hooper 's directing techniques . it 's a shame , there was a lot of potential here between hooper , the story , and the cast ; but it all got wasted . there 's some nice moments here and there ( the apocalyptic flashback sequence is very nicely done ) , but there 's not enough here to make dance of the dead what it could have been
