whiney , alcoholic , aging hippie makes ass of himself in another culture i hate to be the only one to say it . but this movie sucked . it 's very strange to me how the premise being about a bluesmen going to tuva to connect with throat singers was abouts something else entirerly which was not inspirational . this movie is really about the stupidest americans going to another culture and being disrespectful . the main character paul pena is the biggest complaining ass . he manages to stay pretty drunk throughout his whole time in tuva , and in one instance hands an unsuspecting tuvan a joint . not that i wouldnt have enjoyed doing that as well . but its hard to take since paul also complains of needing medication and being depressed . but paul isnt the only ass of this documentary . he also has help from his friends of tuva and the filmers . if there is any value in watchings this piece of @ # * # its in what not to do when you visit other countries . seriously , one of his friends even got into a fight and almost died there . from that character 's earlier appearences in the film , i would have to say that he would have deserved it . the only thing going for this movie is photage of acual tuvan 's singing . im so sorry they had to meet this guy . if you do decide to get this do n't forget to watch the interview with the directors . thats definately the best part . ive met some pretty ridiculous film students before , but this two are like charactures of them . if you are interested in seeing other movies where americans act retarded in other countries i would recommend seeing the journey of man
