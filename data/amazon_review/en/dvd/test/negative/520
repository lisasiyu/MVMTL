complete waste of time ! the good girl is a horror of a film . it imagines itself as an ode to the everyman , trapped in a humdrum existence . what it becomes on film is an insulting example of hollywood filmmaking at its worst . i use the word insulting because that is what i felt as i watched this movie . aniston , nelson , gyllenhaal , all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a `` forrest gump '' imitation . gyllenhaal and aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk . the way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog , it 's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying . the film itself is grey and dull . the other characters in the film flat and stereotypical ( i.e . the coworker who invites her to bible study ) . overall this movie is n't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to dvd . in another era it probably would have never made it to the screen . oh how i miss that era ... ..
