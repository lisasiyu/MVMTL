definitely not science fiction i 've seen cheesy and i 've seen wannabe with the difference between the two being the level pandering to a more intelligent audience . this movie is definitely for guys that like to get their shakespeare from wwf . schwarzenegger 's best movie will ever be terminator . if he could have ended with the classic `` i 'll be back '' and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction . last good science fiction i saw was gattaca . total recall definitely ai n't science fiction and is n't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator . now that was action you could taste and you knew there was n't much pretense of science fiction going on . i 'd give total recall a 0 or less but they only let me enter a 1
