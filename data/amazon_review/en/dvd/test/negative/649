definitely not one of arnold 's best ... eraser has a few scenes that will keep your attention , but overall the movie displayed poor acting , stunts that are impossible and a mediocre plot . this movie possibly will be owned by many , but remembered by few . james caan was the only talent that eraser has to offer . sorry guys , my wife bought it , i watched it , gave it away and divorced her
