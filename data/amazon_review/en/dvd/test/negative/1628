a fine cast of actors , wasted . after watching this extremely low-budget film of a tale based on the historical story of `` hamlet '' it was easy to see where all the money went : to the cast members . the cast is loaded with potential . it includes gabriel byrne , helen mirren , christian bale , a youthful looking kate beckinsale ( she has come a long , long way since this film ) , and a plethora of the kind of actors that make you ask , `` what other movie did i see that actor in ? '' but the rest of the film fails to live up to this monumental promise . for much of the movie it looks and feels like a made-for-television romp through medieval times . it has a small cast of haggard-looking extras in peasant clothing , royalty that , if not for the crowns they wore , would be indistinguishable from the common herd , and some very predictable and flawed direction . the followers of the king , peasantry included , number about thirty in total and they all live in this small wooden village . the director makes the mistake of using a large amount of voice-over narration to propel the story , which by the end was whittled down to about 90 minutes of masterpiece theater shot in the countryside . one scene has hamlet dashing from a buring hall , sword in hand , but when he rounds the corner of a building his sword is missing ; cut to the following scene of hamlet confronting the new king , his murderous uncle , and the sword reappears in his hand . that kind of blatantly poor film editing is unforgivable . the acting ranges from good to passable , but no amount of thespian zeal could have or did save this project from gradual diminishing returns . except for the sighting of a schoolgirl version of kate beckinsale , prim and proper as all young lasses tend to be , this film is sadly a waste of time and money .
