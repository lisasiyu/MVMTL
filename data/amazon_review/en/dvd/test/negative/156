not too good for kids denise austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults . this video is n't kid friendly , and does n't have a good feel for kids . to be honest , it is very close to most of denise 's exercise videos for adults . what denise has forgotten , or may have never known , is kids are kids , and they need to be treated accordingly , and that means with exercise videos to . a good choice for kids is - kick to get fit jr. -for kids , this video is done by a qualified kid 's fitness professional , not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids , and just hoping they can do them . my kids are not at all happy with this program . there are 6 & 10 years old , and they were bored & turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes , mostly because they did n't understand the movements , and then found most of the other movements very hard to do . once again , the forgotten point - kids are kids , and they need to be treated accordingly . one last point , in the video denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children 's exercise & fitness . this is all good except they all forgot one very important detail , - you must be able to teach & instruct children at a level they understand . just because you know something about exercise , it does n't mean you are able to teach it to children . knowledge is one thing - teaching & instructing is another , and the fact is , some people are just not very good at instructing children . a point that is very clearly displayed within this program .
