really bad , do n't do this to yourself i bought this set because i was jonesing to watch some baseball history before the season started , and boy am i sorry i bought this . the narrator is bad , the soundtrack is cheesy and repetitive , and most of the biographical information is presented in a way that keeps it from being interesting . even at six times the price i recommend buying ken burns ' `` baseball '' documentary , by far the best thing i 've ever seen about baseball . but if an 18 hour documentary is too much for you to watch , then i would recommend the `` when it was a game '' series . anything but `` baseball 's greatest legends - diamond memories '' . this set is so bad that i was only able to get about 2/3 of the way through the first disc and i have n't even bothered looking at the other two discs that came with it . please , save yourselves the money and most importantly the time . do not buy this
