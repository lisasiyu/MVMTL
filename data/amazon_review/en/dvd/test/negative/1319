barbi doll i do n't really like video collections . live music is so much more interesting . the only exception i can think of to that rule is the video collection by tom petty , because he put out the most imaginative and well produced videos . i 'd much rather see shania actually singing and relating to an audience than lipping it to these recorded songs . the only songs on this vid that are live are the last two , and one of them is the boring rock this country , one of her weakest songs , a sort of takeoff on donnie and marie 's i 'm a little bit country , a little bit rock and roll . it 's mostly all glitz and glitter . it 's mostly just seeing the latest outfit and makeup shania is wearing . that is superficial . let 's have a real person instead . i do n't care about the outfits and the makeup . seeing her pretend to sing just does n't cut it . i 've heard these exact versions of the songs plenty of times . come on over is a fantastic album . she looks great , particularly in her hawaiian look during the romantic you 've got a way . i love that song and i love her hawaiian look . it 's all so romantic . i 'm not wild about her look when she 's wearing slacks or sweat pants . it makes the bottom half of her look so ordinary and boring . she looks so much better in something feminine . sporty spice is not a turn on and is not romantic . if you want to turn it up a notch in your music videos , pick up somebody 's live performance . it 's a whole different feeling . granted , some of them are n't the greatest , but when they are good , they are a lot better than this . you actually see a real person on stage . not just barbi doll in her newest outfit and makeup
