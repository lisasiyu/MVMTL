83 minutes of my life wasted . what a waste of time this movie was . i could not wait for it to end . to call this an amateur film is an insult to amateurs . while i was watching it , the power in my house went off . i kinda hoped it would stay off . what i liked about it was the cover , thats it . i think they should just sell the case without the dvd . or throw a blank dvd in the case . here is the movie in a nutshell : horrendous acting , garbage script , filmed on what appeared to be a $ 50 video camera . avoid this trash ! the 1971 zodiak killer was bad too , but it was the kind of bad that was worth watching . not this movie
