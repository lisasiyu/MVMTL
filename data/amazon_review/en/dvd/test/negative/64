be warned i love this film . it 's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing . i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd , unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used . i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches . in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture . i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves . i 'd have given 5 stars if it had , so the minus three is for the appaling print . one of the worst i 've ever seen
