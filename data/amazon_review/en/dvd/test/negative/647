back to the future ... of impossible romance ? if you loved the back to the future trilogy and , generally speaking , time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen ... simply forget about buying this dvd . all being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie , while you try to figure out all the `` time-traveling science '' you 've been taught so far , then space you out close to the end , leaving you totally speechless . this is not good , simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros , while winding up with some abrubt , nonsense end of the movie , with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all : they simply had to eventually stop shooting , so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick , no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot . not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either : look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie
