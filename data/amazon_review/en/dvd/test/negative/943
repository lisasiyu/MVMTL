and now you see how our state was suckered into the oil biz i came upon this film while browsing my university library . my curiosity was picqued , since my home state is rarely discussed beyond such topics as drinking ( mardi gras ) and eating ( cajun food ) . this film reminds me of a line from an explanatory plaque in jean lafitte national park . looking out over a marsh ( through which runs a large gas pipeline ) , the panel details all the restoration efforts sponsored by exxonmobil , shell-texaco , et al. , all of whom have refineries in or around the wetlands . if they 're cleaning anything , it 's their own mess . and what methods are they using ? `` bio-restorative detonations , '' i believe , was the term used . are those `` life-giving bombs '' ? back to the film , funded as propaganda by standard oil co. when local sentiment was turning against the company . i 'll pass over how many times the innocently befuddled cajuns smile broadly at the blessed oil rig plopped in their marsh , and the way the young boy is given the disney-nature-film treatment , as amusingly naive as lobo the wolf or henry the mountain burro . no , just watch this film and catch a glimpse of the prosperity once promised to our humble state . and then visit the beautiful scenery of norco , la , in the middle of the famed cancer alley
