big letdown . where 's the screenplay to this ? dad goes over some pretty annoying eye candy of giants midgets and a huge fish without any real alligorical content and that about it folks , trashy staff . the big promise of some sort of father son relationship forming is again apparently absent . thumbs down of jessica lange , a great actress i ve see on stage a couple of times who goes completely wasted here ( i do n't think she mutters anything in excess of a couple of lines frankly ) as a cartoon wife character . tim 's aiming to be the next ed wood possibly with this one , but , and i never thought i d say this , ed wood at least had some workable screenplay . just plain trash
