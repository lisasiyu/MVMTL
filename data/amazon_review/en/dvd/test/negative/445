these are the worst ever ! my son loves `` real life '' trucks and big machines , so i thought these would be fun for him to watch . they are not , in fact they do n't even hold his attention . dave talks way too much and is way too goofy even for little kids . just show the trucks in action and forget all the up close stuff on dave . i have since bought the i love cat machines series and they are fantastic
