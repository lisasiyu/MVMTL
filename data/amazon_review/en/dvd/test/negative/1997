phewww ... .awful ! i see that freeman & hackman are executive producers on this stinker . just reaffirms , i guess , that actors are not the best judges of good material for themselves . the truth in spades in this case . i think , as i 'm sure millions do , that freeman & hackman are the very best around , but i 've never seen them work with such stiff , stilted pathetically sensationalistic material . on top of which hackman is terribly miscast & comes off shrill & artificial in a part that would have been a natural for someone like ben kingsley . why oh why did n't they just take the moolah they raised for this turkey & give it to kenneth branagh to direct them in a dream version of othello
