blinds are like regulars , now . this is the one ! the other dvd collections for seasons 1 , 2 & 3 were pretty funny ( ok ... some of the funniest stuff of all time , especially `` druggachusetts , '' and `` the chip on the shoulder club '' ) but the fourth season was when it all came together . it does n't get any better than the episode called `` show me your weenis ! '' the first time i saw this , in 1998 when it first aired , i realized that this was the absolute pinnacle of intelligent , over-the-top american comedy . surreal , sharp , better than any british zaniness , and full of bizarre ideas like `` furniture for the blind '' that lets you know where you are with pre-recorded celebrity voices ; and the all-time greatest , `` wyckyd scepter , '' which must be seen to be believed . bob and dave , you are so naked ! better than monty python any day of the week . better than any other so-called `` comedy '' series i can think of . if you get only one of the mr. show dvd sets , get this one .
