what any true buckethead fan would expect/want ... simply put , i bought this , brought it home , and spent the wee hours of the night smiling on the couch as the one and only buckethead filled my living room with his unique brand of guitar-shred-funk-fusion-dementia . this dvd is a trip , from the wacked out menus to the oodles of content that cover his whole career so far ... videos ( praxis ! ) , discography ( you think you have it all , but i assure you , you do n't ) , and a bonus dvd with 2 live shows ( it does n't hurt that i can see myself in the boston one , laughing like a goon as he hands out toys ) . there 's just tons of bucketgoodies hiding in here . this dude is just the whole package-eddie van halen and eddie hazel all in one , mixed with leatherface and the shape . so rad . this dvd definitely had a lot of time and creativity put into it , so to anyone who does n't enjoy this for the perfect representation of the bucketman that it is , you simply be missin ' the point . might i suggest you stick to your dream theater/satriani/g3 dvd 's , you 5.1 surround sound obsessed prog-metal nerds ... you do n't like chickens , get out the coop
