wonderful , vintage christmas memories what a find ! it 's sad to think that this special was almost lost , but now it 's here in color . for those of you who grew up in the 1950 's , it 's a wonderful trip down memory lane to a simpler time . i do agree that frank seems a little more tired than bing , but both light up the screen with there take on some traditional christmas carols . i give this 4 stars because , as it is so blatantly mentioned in the extras , the restoration job done on this film is horrible ! but , i am at least thankful it exists and that we have the chance to enjoy it , even if it is not sparkling clear . *note* careful observers will notice that a new copyright date has been digitally edited into the closing credits `` mmi ''
