csi continues to shine having absorbed the third season , it 's amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically . in this season , apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes , the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises : grissom 's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made ; katherine 's personal life undergoes a tragic change ; warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation ; sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement ; nick takes up a dangerous new hobby ; and brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self . we get dwarves , stand up comics , vigilantes , murderous actors and more . the cast as always is impeccable with william petersen continuing to be the most complex character on television . brilliant show just keeps getting better
