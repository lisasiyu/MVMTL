`` you ca n't escape destiny by running away . '' set in the sleepy german town of bremen , the 1922 german silent film `` nosferatu '' is based on the bram stoker novel , `` dracula . '' the film company was unable to obtain the rights to the story , so the names of the stoker 's main characters were changed to avoid legal complications . bram stoker 's widow sued anyway , and won . all existing copies of the film were ordered to be destroyed by the court handling the case , but since many copies were already in circulation , `` nosferatu '' was not lost . in this version of the vampire legend , a young married man , hutter ( gustav von wangenheim ) is commissioned by the peculiar , repulsive knock ( alexander granach ) to visit count orlock in transylvania . count orlock , apparently wants to buy a house in bremen , and knock tells hutter to travel to transylvania and make the necessary arrangements with the count . knock tells his employee not to pay any attention to the stories of phantoms -- it 's all nonsense . hutter , who imagines that he 's hit the big time with this commission , travels to transylvania leaving his wife , ellen ( greta schroeder ) behind in the care of friends . the trip to transylvania builds up the suspense as hutter travels closer and closer to the lair of the count . locals at an inn near the castle are full of dread , but hutter laughs off their horror by blaming the rumours he 's been warned about . even when he 's taken by coach to the castle , and dropped some way off because the coachmen fear to go closer , hutter still proceeds on his journey . the count 's nightmare castle is incredibly atmospheric , but it is n't until hutter slices his finger while eating dinner that it begins to dawn on him that there 's something wrong with this situation . the count -- who does n't look human -- expresses an inordinate amount of interest in hutter 's blood . while hutter becomes the count 's next meal , his wife back in bremen experiences horrible nightmares . meanwhile the count travels back to bremen via his coffin in the cargo hold of a ship . the people back in bremen begin to read newspaper accounts of the plague spreading throughout the region , and after nosferatu 's coffin arrives , residents are found dead in their beds . naturally the blame falls on the plague -- a disease shrouded in mystery . fearful residents in bremen stay isolated in their homes , but death still finds them . the element of sexuality always evident in later vampire films also exists in the symbolic surrender of a victim as she presents her neck to nosferatu while collapsing on her bed . while the film is of great interest to anyone who likes silent film or german expressionism , it 's also fascinating to watch the film and see how the dracula legend mutated over the years with various versions . modern versions of dracula tend to portray him as an accomplished , enigmatic seducer . nosferatu -- on the other hand -- looks like a ghoul . f.w . murnau 's film is a masterpiece of the imagination . nosferatu is a nightmarish figure -- a ghoul who rises from his coffin to relentlessly seek his food . the film -- devoid of the special effects that dominate today 's cinema is gripping , and the scenes of the rats pouring out of the coffin are unforgettable . this alpha dvd was fair quality given the film 's age . it was certainly watchable -- one note however , in the subtitles , the original names -- count dracula , renfield etc . are used -- displacedhuma
