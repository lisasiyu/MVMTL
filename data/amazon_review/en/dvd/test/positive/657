excellent technicality i heard many mixed opinions about this dvd but i 'm glad that i finally decided to buy one for myself . lang lang 's fingers are like flying upon the piano . his facial expression may seem distracting but i take it nothing more than an artist 's expression of his own enjoyment in the music . great music ! not to be missed . i do hope to see more of his dvds coming .
