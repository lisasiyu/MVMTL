jon-a-than , jon-a-than , jon-a-than ... ... ... ... the year is 2018 and there is no war and no crime . corporations have taken the place of governments and the masses are entertained through a sport of modern-day gladiators on skates and speeding motorcycles where only the strongest may someday retire in peace . though released in 1975 , rollerball has stood the test of time due to the forward-thinking of the writers within the sci-fi/sports realms and using the setting to describe the age-old conflict of the individual versus a corrupt society . jonathan e - played by james caan - is becoming bigger than the game and it is strongly suggested to him by energy corporation executive bartholomew - john houseman - that he should retire . jonathan e can not bring himself to abandon his teammates & leave the game - a retirement party finds the superstar not following his script - which leads to a match that degenerates into a vicious life & death struggle to be the last player standing . the game is already brutal enough before the last game - played on a track , with the object to place a metal ball into a cylinder to score points - as teams named for major cities actually compete for corporations . the action sequences are brilliant and the drama of the last game is chilling . and that contest ultimately brings - on the track , at least - victory without a real winner .
