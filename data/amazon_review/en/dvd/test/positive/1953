best buy my daughter is three months old and has been discovering/watching these dvd 's since she was two weeks old . i did n't think she would pay any attention to them but she loves them ! she sit 's in her bouncy seat and we watch them together . she coos and smiles at all of the animals and kicks her feet to the music . well worth the money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
