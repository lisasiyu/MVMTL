look out for the zuni ! ! ! back in the heyday of dark shadows dan curtis did some telly movies . frankenstein with robert foxworth , the norliss tapes with roy thinnes , the night stalker with darren mcgavin , scream of the wolf with clint walker and peter graves , then eventually went on to do bigger projects like the winds of war and war and remembrance with robert mitchum . during that salad days of the mid 1970s , he did a nifty `` novella '' style movie called trilogy of terror with karen black . he went on to use black in burnt offerings the following year . it 's a three story showcase , displaying the varied talents of black , but it 's in the last one where curtis breaks out and really does something memorable . the first novella tale is `` julie '' . this tell was never fully fleshed out about a college professor who has dark secrets . nice quirky ending keeps this one for being average . the second is `` millicent and therese '' . after the promise of `` julie '' , i really expected a bit more from this rather obvious tale . is good fun , just nothing special . still a fine showcase for black to show what she can do . it was just so all totally out there , no twist of the screw to make it more . `` amelia '' the final one is based on richard matheson 's prey , and it outstanding . once you see these story you will never forget the zuni warrior that comes to life . amelia is totally abused by her possessive and controlling mother . she tries to break these ties that bind , but she is no match . she buys a zuni doll and it comes to life . no spoiler there . you can see that by the cover . it 's the story that is amazing . black 's ending is original and memorable . this was low budget telly movie remember , so accept the quality as not motion picture level . still a great halloween movie and tribute to curtis who died march '' this year
