does the field of intention love nature ? the power of intention is both inspiring and troubling . as an environmental and social activist who lives off of less the 10k per year , i was wondering as i read this book if i was holding in my hands what was once an ancient tree ? our ancient ancestors are being clear cut at an alarming rate in the pacific northwest . most will go extinct in our lifetimes . corporations continue to consolidate their political power in both mainstream parties : democrat and republican alike enact legislation on behalf of corporations that will open what is left of these ancient giants to clear-cutting . stories will be told of these trees on day , perhaps even to our own grandchildren beginning with the words , `` once upon a time there was a great and majestic forest . '' your democratic and republican representatives are now organizing the last buffalo hunt . you can still have your voice be heard on behalf of these ancient trees before it is too late . on page 48 of his book mr. dyer makes the following observation , `` practice kindness toward the earth by picking up a piece of litter that 's on your path , or saying a silent prayer of gratitude for the existence of rain , the color of flowers , or even the paper you hold in your hand that was donated by a tree . '' sadly , mr. dyer 's observation is confused . the paper we hold in our hands is produced by multi-national corporations on public lands administered by bureaucrats marching to one tune : politicians who accept large gratuities in the form of moneyed transactions so favorable legislation opens these national treasures to exploitation . this book review is offered as a creative challenge to mr. dyer to connect to the field of intention on behalf of non-sentient life . hopefully , the field of intention extends the same beneficence to the astonishing field of nature , not in a fashion that promotes anthropocentrism and narcissism , but rather amplifies the web of life and its connections to human life so that a win-win situation is advocated rather than diminished . this begs the question : is the book worth the $ 24.95 i paid to read it ? i suppose that if the field of intention can be tapped into for the benefit of our earth mother , my answer is yes ! if , on the other hand , the spiritual principles are used only for generating prosperity for the self alone , then the $ 24.95 would be better spent planting a tree to help offset the expense of mr. dyer 's next best seller .
