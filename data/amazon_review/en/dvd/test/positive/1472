a really cute dvd - a review of `` bob the builder - dig ! lift ! haul ! '' this is a cute btb dvd that has not only the regulars ( bob , wendy , spud , and the crew ) but many of the other favorite characters including farmer pickles , mr. beasley , and that tea making mrs. potts . there is also scruffty the dog , and some adorable mice and bunnies ! in the first story , `` scruffty 's big dig '' , scruffty the dog manages to fall into a bunny hole and get stuck . muck passes by and gets spooked by scruffty 's howling , but it all works out in the end when bob and the crew solve the mystery and save scruffty . the second story , `` bob 's boots '' , has bob breaking in new boots . the boots squeak and attract mice , which as we all know lofty does not like . lofty ends up running for home , followed by bob , followed by the mice -- which bob does n't realize are there . bob thinks lofty is imagining that there are mice . all of this in interweaved with a sub-plot wherein spud takes bob 's lunch by accident . the mice end up chasing spud because he gave them some crumbs . in the third story , `` mr. beasley 's do-it-yourself disaster '' , bob is hired to build a garden shed , while wendy is busy painting mrs. pott 's fence . chaos ensues when bob gets diverted from the shed work to do a quick roof repair for mr. dixon . bob and wendy keep missing one another ; and mr. beasley begins the project himself , working under the misguided notion that he can use tools . wendy shows up to wonder what is wrong with bob that the structure looks so crooked . she repairs it and it 's actually pretty funny when bob and mr. beasley actually think mr. b did the work . the fourth story , `` spud lends a hand '' , is about the installation of a sprinkler system for farmer pickles . everything goes fine until spud 'lends a hand ' and advises the crew on how to finish the installation of a rain-tank . chaos results when spud ends up giving advice to the lofty and the guys . the tank breaks loose and not only rolls down hill , but destroys wendy 's gift which is a sailboat . bob ends up saving the day when he takes the remains of wendy 's sail boat and turns it into a motor boat . the final story is `` dizzy 's crazy paving '' . it 's my favorite because it has wendy in a 'if you have lemons , make lemonade ' kind of situation . mrs. pott 's wants a new sidewalk and everything starts out fine until too much fooling around leaves the square pavers that they were going to use , broken up . wendy solves the problem by making a sort of crazy quilt sidewalk with the colorful tiles . the stories are linked by the mischief , humor , and creativity . five stars ( for a bob the builder dvd ) . five classic bob stories on this one . my son loves this dvd and can watch it over and over . sometimes he will focus on what bob is doing , and other times the equipment , and yet other times the little animals that in the stories : bunnies , dog , cat , bird , mice . great fair for rainy days
