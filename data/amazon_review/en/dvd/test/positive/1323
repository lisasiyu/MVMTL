children 's classical ballet the production looked like a `` wet fresco '' on the wall of an old basilica that has come to life . the choreography is in close harmony with the musical score . i enjoyed the meadow dancers , aqua dancers , grafitti wallsters and graffiti tree . but , most of all , i enjoyed the `` foot-prep '' of peter , the grandfather , the cat , the bird , the duck and the wolf .
