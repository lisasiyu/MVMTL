journey to the center of the earth milo thatch is a young man obsessed with finding atlantis . the obsession already destroyed his grandfather and is now about to end his career as well . in the early 1900 's milo gets a break when a wealthy friend of his grandfather settles a bet and agrees to fund an expedition to find atlantis . everything is ready to go what with subs , vehicles , crew , supplies and experts . all that is needed now is for milo to bring his linguistic abilities in order to translate an ancient book that contains directions to the lost civilization . the expedition is quickly reduced to a mere handful of survivors and it is up to milo to save them by leading them to atlantis . milo succeeds and atlantis is found . atlantis is alive by not thriving . milo may be able to help the ancient civilization if he can get around some of their laws , prejudices and superstitions . but all is put in jeopardy when certain truths about motives are revealed and the fate of atlantis may be sealed for good . again it falls to milo to rise above his bookish ways and find the hero within and save the day . as this is a disney flick we know it will all work out in the end somehow . while i find the story entertaining i am puzzled by a few things like why the vikings use english , how someone found a path on the ocean floor without a submarine , or how altlanteans who are over 8,000 years old have forgotten their culture ( this usually happens with successive generations and not in what amounts to childhood to twenty ) . but if you can get around that , the film is filled with colorful characters , beautiful sets , and some very good voice characterizations . michael j . fox as milo was wonderful ( and lets not forget james garner 's role ) . if you want some fun and adventure , this is a film that provides it . check it out
