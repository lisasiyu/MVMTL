love ai n't no hepburn ! jennifer love hewitt is clearly not audrey hepburn , she does n't even come close , but , i will concede that she did a great job at producing and starring in this made-for-tv-movie . it takes us from audrey 's childhood all the way to one of her many defining moments - the filming of breakfast at tiffany 's . it really is a pleasant film to watch . although the script can be slow at times , i feel that it honors audrey 's memory . even her son approved of this biography . ultimately , i 'd like to say to those who bash ms. hewitt for starring in this bio-pic , i 'm glad that she used the fame she has to introduce audrey to a younger audience that possibly would have never learned about her otherwise . i give this movie four stars because of emmy rossum 's incredible talents . i wish her and ms. hewitt many more successes
