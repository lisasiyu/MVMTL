good ... for what it is . titan ae is a really good scifi movie . it has fantastic visuals , chases , and a good enough story to keep you interested . the voice acting is also pretty good . unfortunately the movie suffers from what many movies , especially in this genre , suffer from . they do n't commit to an adult or child-based audience , nor do that go after strictly a scifi audience or a more general audience . so what ends up happening is you get just enough of both , without fully focusing on one target audience , kind of sterile , but still good . if you are looking for mind blowing concepts and something other than 'standard scifi fare ' this is n't where to look . if you want a good movie that keeps you entertained and that the kids can watch too , this is a great flick .
