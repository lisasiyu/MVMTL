my most watched film of all time ! ! ! having been lucky enough to have seen and videotaped the original broadcast of ric burn 's `` coney island '' way back in 1991 i found myself becoming more and more obsessed with this brilliant documentary . at the time i worked nights and would get home around 3 or 4 a.m. every night - most nights i would pop in my tape of `` coney island '' - i lived and breathed this film . it is everything the above review says it is and more . anyone with a interest in history , immigration , carnivals , amusement parks , nostalgia , film and photography should definatley purchase this film . you will not regret it . other titles from the amazing ric burns include `` the way west '' , `` the donner party '' `` new york '' as well as the epic `` the civil war '' which he did with his brother ken . as far as `` coney island '' goes you 'd be nuts to pass this one up .
