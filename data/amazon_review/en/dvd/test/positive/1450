caution advised , but still great ! this 2nd chapter takes place almost immediately after `` zombie island '' concludes . while i do n't consider this 2nd chapter quite as good as `` zombie island , '' this 2nd chapter nails down the formula for a good sequel . it brings back enough familiar elements ( the gang ) , but it offers a different adventure . while this 2nd chapter is not quite as intense as `` zombie island , '' it would probably still be a good idea for parents to screen it before they give it to their children . scooby and the gang solve a mystery ( at least in part ) at a museum and meet the writer ben ravencroft . he invites the gang to visit his 'quiet ' home in massachusetts . for an animated movie , the scenery is actually quite impressive . well , ben and the gang discover that the town is anything but quiet due to the publicity over the possible presence of a witch 's ghost . ( the mayor and the t shirt guy bear a striking resemblance to boss hogg and sheriff roscoe . ) naturally , our favorite gang gets curious but scooby and shaggy are more interested in food . ( big surprise . ) there is a hilarious scene where they go to a restaurant that is too good even for them . well , ben and our gang meet the hex girls who play good music and at the same time draw some suspicion . this is a difficult movie not to ruin , but i 'll try . the misleads make sense upon discovery , and just when we think the movie is over , we find out that the real horror is yet to come . though it does n't quite pack the punch of `` zombie island , '' the climax is really well done and surprisingly scarey . again , this movie may be a little too much for young children , but older children and even some adults are bound to enjoy this .
