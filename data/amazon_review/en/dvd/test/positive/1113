lang 's triumphant talkie debut this film is easily in the top 5 of fritz lang 's best films , and quite possibly his # 1 best sound film as well . in addition to being lang 's debut sound film , it was also germany 's very first sound film , and really goes to show the benefits of having waited a little while to move away from silents and into sound pictures . almost every sound film from the late twenties and very early thirties suffers from a static camera and almost nonstop chatter , as though film-making just went backwards in time by about 30 years and reverted back to being filmed stage plays instead of true `` motion pictures . '' but by 1931 , a number of those wrinkles had been ironed out , and what resulted is an absolute masterpiece . and unlike a number of directors working in those very early years of sound , lang struck a very good balance between dialogue scenes and scenes of relative silence . he knew that the actors did n't have to be talking nonstop for it to be a good film worth watching . of course , the director is only one part of the film 's genius ; the actors are brilliant too , in particular peter lorre , who truly gave the performance of his career even though it was his first starring role . the film also really sets the stage for the later film noir genre , what with the terrific shadows , lighting , and suspenseful mood and atmosphere . the film does start out a little slowly , but before long it gets more and more intense and compelling . the plot needs time to be established and for the viewer to be fully drawn into it . lang did suspense and crime thrillers so well , and this film is no exception . a child murderer is on the loose , and with no answers in sight , the townspeople become paranoid and bloodthirsty , particularly when it comes to those whom they already know are criminals . the people in the underworld suffer the most from all of these paranoid accusations , and so resent how their community is suffering that they resolve to not only find the murderer themselves , but to do it all without any help from the police , who in turn have no idea what these criminals are up to . even criminals have standards ; it 's often said that child rapists and murderers are reviled by `` ordinary '' criminals because that goes far beyond the pale of the things they did . when the criminals finally track down hans beckert , the murderer , at a warehouse , they tie up the night watchmen so they wo n't alert the police , so insistent are they on capturing him by themselves , even as they race to find him and get everyone back out before the police might get there . the final section of the film , in the criminals ' kangaroo court , is one of the most powerful scenes ever set to film . one starts out feeling repugnance at this menace , this person who molests and kills children , but by the time the film is up , one ca n't help but feel sorry for him , or at least see him as a human being . we never see him hurting children , and do n't even see his face right away . he 's not shown as a monster or an evil person ; indeed , who would ever suspect that such a baby-faced rotund man would be a child molester or murderer ? the treatment of him is surprisingly progressive for the era . while what he 's done is n't being excused or apologised for , he 's ultimately shown to be a victim himself , a very sick man haunted by this monster inside of him , doing these horrible horrible things because of it , only finding peace when he 's committing these criminal acts . is he any worse than these career criminals who have chosen to live this lifestyle , people who could have become bank tellers , teachers , or doctors , people who had a choice because they did n't have this monster constantly following them ? this must have been a positively revolutionary idea in 1931 , when many people blamed people like beckert instead of considering that there might be medical or scientific reasons for it , when criminals were given no sympathy and viewed as unreformable menaces to society instead of human beings who were made prisoners by something beyond their control . it 's the kind of film that stays with one long after viewing it , and only gets better with multiple viewings . extras include audio commentary , an interview with fritz lang a year before his death ( once again he tells the tall tale of his meeting with goebbels and how he left germany late at night with barely any money , never to return until after wwii , even though his passport and other historical evidence paint a quite different picture ! ) , the mini-documentary 'a physical history of m , ' a gallery of pictures , stills , and drawings , an interview with harold nebenzal ( son of producer seymour nebenzal ) , a ten-minute version of 'm ' made by claude chabrol , and excerpts from discussions editor paul falkenberg had with students in his film class as they watched the film . overall , this is a must-see for anyone interested in film history ; one ca n't claim to be a true student of classic film and never have seen it . this film also seems to enjoy the distinction of being one of those films that just about everyone agrees is a classic and a terrific film , instead of one of those films that people are divided on about if it 's great or if it 's just overrated
