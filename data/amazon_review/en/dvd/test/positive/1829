romero , please forgive me ! ! ! as an academic , i 'm supposed to tell you how snyder destroyed romero 's original message about consumerism . and i 'm supposed to tell you that he rewrote one of the most important lines of the film : when asked why the zombies are flocking to the mall , stephen replies , `` some kind of instinct . memory , of what they used to do . this was an important place in their lives . '' synder 's alteration is a bastardization of the original . . . and lacks `` punch . '' but , seriously , who cares ? ! ! the fact of the matter is . . . i love this film ! the casting was fantastic ! ! rhames brings depth to a character in which few actors could find depth ( he portrays a stoic police officer who 's brother is trapped on an infected military-base ) . this man is a legend ! ! likewise polly and weber add `` soul '' to this film about the `` souless '' ( their characters find love amidst the bloody carnage . . . and , yes , it sounds cheesy , but it is low-key , well-done ) . furthermore , burrell 's character is wonderfully unlikeable ( though it is the `` apocalypse , '' he still believes that his bank-account grants him privilege ! you actually find yourself hoping that this guy will die ! ! ) finally , kelly 's portrayal of cj is genuinely complex . . . watch for a great `` fifth-act conversion '' ! ! what really engaged me in this film was the cinematography . while a film need not have a huge budget to be a success , this film proves that it does n't hurt either ! ! the film quality is top-notch ! ! the helicopter shots are gorgeous ! ! and the use of color is exquisite . if you want to see a beautifully rendered horror-film , this is it ! ! the conclusion is disheartening ( without revealing too much information ) . it marks a new trend in horror . now , the `` real '' conclusion is couched in the credits . . . which reveals the director 's hesitance ( and , no , it 's not a tactic to make the audience watch the credits ) . it is radically different from the 1978 ending . some people love it . . . some hate it . ( we have also seen this `` problem '' with boyle 's 28 days later . . . in america we received the `` happy '' ending and weeks later , the `` unhappy '' ending . . . directors rightly fear to offer a genuinely dark ending . . . it will be interesting to watch how this trend evolves ! ! ) hey , even if you do n't dig close-examination of film ( not everyone does ! ! ) and just want a great action movie . . . this is it ! ! it will not disappoint ! ! ! and prepare for synder 's new film : 300 ! ! it looks dazzling !
