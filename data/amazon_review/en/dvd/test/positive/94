not bad i read some of the reviews before i purchased it . i agree that the dvd was not made with high tech , the toys used were not even new at all , the instructors making weird sounds ( to me ) . i was disappointed at first and planned to sell it right away . but i thought i should give a try to my son , 16 months . surprisingly , it catches my 16 month boy full attention ( he would not pay attention at all to baby bumblebee ) . he watches for over 2 weeks , he started to copy the sounds and gestures they made in the dvd . sometimes , he will even make the sounds before the instructor does . though , he still only says mama , but i am already so happy with the current result .
