still terrific after all these years # 51 on the american film institute 's top 100 list , `` the philadelphia story '' is a 1940 comedy that has never lost its popularity . it 's the film that rekindled katherine hepburn 's then-ailing film career , the only movie james stewart ever won an oscar for , and a movie that cary grant demanded a huge salary for . surprisingly , the movie is actually funny to this very day . grant plays c.k . dexter haven , a millionaire who has recently separated from his wife tracy lord ( hepburn ) . now , tracy is getting remarried and dexter has hired two people from the gossip magazine spy to cover the marriage . they are macaulay connor ( stewart ) and elizabeth imbrie . neither one is happy to be there . connor is on the verge of quitting his job at the spy , as he fancies himself a writer and is sick of writing gossip articles . elizabeth fancies herself a painter and is sick of taking photographs of rich people . pretty soon , connor finds himself falling for tracy as dexter finds himself falling for her again . stewart deserved his oscar as he steals every scene he 's in . as i said , the film is still very funny to this day ( a rarity , since comedy has changed so much over the years ) . anyway , `` the philadelphia story '' is not my favorite film of all time . it think there 's plenty of films on the list placed beneath it that are much better , but `` the philadelphia story '' is a charming film that is definitely worth your time . grade : a
