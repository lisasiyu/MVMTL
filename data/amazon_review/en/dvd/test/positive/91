pretty good despite cheesy title it 's 1961 ; the ussr has finally finished its nuclear powered submarine and is ready to deploy it off the east coast of the united states for the purpose of ... brinksmanship ? but hold on , there is a problem ; the soviet union is staffed with incompetents ! ! ( one of communism 's most odious flaws is that it does not inspire the common man to excel ) . the menacing black submarine is doomed from the get-go . it leaks , and it is cobbled together with substandard parts . after heading out to sea , there is a problem with the nuclear reactor and several men must go in for repairs wearing only chemical suits because the warehouse was out of radiation suits . the men receive lethal doses of radiation , but unfortunately the doctor does n't know anything about radiation sickness ... he is only giving them aspirin . before long radiation begins to permeate the ship . the entire crew is in danger . the officers are of two minds - some want to save the crew at the expense of letting the submarine fall into the hands of the americans , while others want to save face for the soviet union even if it means a lot of men will fall sick or die . as the submarine becomes more and more disabled , as men stumble from the reactor room vomitting and shaking , as the commanding officer repeatedly refuses help from a nearby american destroyer , as the submarines 's food supply is deemed too contaminated to eat , the dread of the crew is really palpable . this movie was very suspenseful because i had no idea how it would end . definitely worth your time
