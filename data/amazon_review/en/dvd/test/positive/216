peyton place ( 1957 ) is a movie to treasure i think it is the americana montages that make the jerry wald/mark robson production of peyton place ( 1957 , fox ) my favorite small-town america soap opera of all time . grace metalious ' scuzzy and scandalous best-selling novel has been carefully adapted by john michael hayes ( rear window and other 1950 's hitchcock gems ) . hampered by censorship that would not allow selena ( oscar nominee hope lange ) to have an abortion , it becomes a secret miscarriage and a public appendectomy . sex scenes become romantic kisses in a vertical position . this is one movie that was actually improved by censorship that forced producer wald , director robson , and writer hayes ( all oscar nominees here ) to get more creative . the movie garnered nine oscar nominations in all , lost all of them in the finals to either the bridge on the river kwai or sayonara , and was a box office blockbuster that vastly improves on the trashy novel . ( caution -- plot spoilers throughout ! ) partially filmed in camden and other very scenic coastal maine locations , peyton place opens with first-person narration by very likeable heroine allison mackenzie ( oscar nominated newcomer diane varsi ) about the beauty of the seasons in her town . she is then seen having a hasty breakfast with mom constance ( best actress oscar nominee lana turner ) before she runs off to high school . seeming drifter mike rossi ( lee phillips ) arrives by car in town and witnesses the son of brutal lucas cross ( oscar nominee arthur kennedy ) and wife nellie ( betty field ) leave home . nellie works as the mackenzie maid . lucas is the alcoholic school janitor . one of my favorite scenes is a montage of allison running through backyards and the woods to get to high school , backed by one of franz waxman 's loveliest scores and william mellor 's beautiful use of cinemascope . at school , mildred dunnock ( miss thornton ) teaches twelfth grade and is expected to be the new principal . but mike rossi becomes the new school principal . we also meet other school board members , including kindly town doctor doc swain ( lloyd nolan in a career performance ) and harrington ( leon ames ) , who runs a textile mill that is the town 's biggest industry . in miss thornton 's classroom , we also meet nice guy male hero norman page ( oscar nominee russ tamblyn ) . so in just the first reel , we are introduced to almost all of the major characters . norman and allison are an appealing central couple . radiating out from them are selena and david nelson , constance and mike rossi ( whose book sex scenes are reduced to forced kisses ) , and bad girl betty anderson ( terry moore ) and harrington 's horny son rodney ( barry coe ) for more dramatic tension and later misunderstandings . ( plot spoilers-beware ! ) the rest of a well-paced and engrossing film masterpiece follows these different couples all over town for 157 minutes . selena gets raped by her stepfather lucas , resulting in the miscarriage that is publicly called an appendectomy . allison wants to be a writer . david nelson wants to be a lawyer . since the time period here is world war two , norman and rodney both go off to fight overseas . there is a beautiful high school dance to auld lang syne and an exquisite montage of boats on maine 's penobscot bay and the glory of summer after a nostalgic high school graduation . there is also an extended sequence in the film 's middle for labor day that rivals labor day in picnic ( 1955 ) as the finest ever put on film-singers , school parades , watermelon and hot dogs . when constance and mike watch a man put a ship into a bottle , then share a lobster dinner on the bay , backed by waxman 's music , peyton place comes very close to being my favorite movie of all time . there is also `` beautiful dreamer '' and rowboats on one river , and two very different couples swimming in a lake outside of peyton place , leading to a major misunderstanding . that 20 minute labor day sequence is unforgettably evocative , but followed by something gripping and allison leaving town to become a professional writer . . the climax of peyton place , roughly the last half hour of 157 minutes , is a court trial . i wo n't tell you who is on trial or for what-we have to have some surprises left in this review-but it has lloyd nolan 's greatest scene as doc swain and a satisfying ending . the finale to the movie is one of my all-time favorites ( partial plot spoiler ) . the final shot is exquisite and euphoric for me , with allison 's voice-over : `` we finally discovered that season of love . it is only found in someone else 's heart . right now , someone is looking everywhere for it , and it is in you , '' with two children riding bikes down a shaded maine street and waxman 's gorgeous score again . ( nine oscar nominations , but not one for the unforgettably beautiful music score ? ! ) the 1957 wald/robson peyton place , acted and written to perfection , is a soap opera masterpiece with a very compelling and rewarding plot and some of the most beautiful americana montages ever put on film . the dvd sells for only $ 14.95 , with audio commentary by surviving cast members tamblyn and moore , restored color , lovely remastered music , and glorious cinemascope letterboxing after decades of cropped pan/scan images . you can finally appreciate william mellor 's use of color and use of wide screen on a movie heavily filmed on both coastal maine locations ( including a lockout mountain scene that is awesome ) and the fox backlot in what is now los angeles ' century city . most of all is a perfect cast down to the bit roles , under mark robson 's skillful direction . peyton place , one of my ten favorite movies ever , is a must-see and must-own on dvd when you have a three hour time slot . actually longer than 157 minutes because of a 30 minute behind-the-scenes featurette , newsreels , and a theatrical trailer ( so you can see how the movie was promoted ) .
