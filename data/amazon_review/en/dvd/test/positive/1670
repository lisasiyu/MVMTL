one of her best works , it 's almost as if she lives the part in my opinion , this is one of elizabeth taylors best works . the film starts out with her basicaly being held , without her will , in a mental hospital . she meets a doctor ( montgomery clift ) who comes to see if he can figure out what is wrong with her , if in fact anything is . after meeting her , he decides to take her to his fathers hospital and work on her there . he puts her in the nurses ' courters , so as not to make her think that she is mentally challenged by putting her with the rest of the patients . to point out the major reason why she is in the hostpital , it is becase she is being held responsible for the death of a mothers son , but near the end of the movie you will find out that it truly was n't her fault . not only does she finally rid herself of the evil mother , but she falls in love with monty and live happily ever after . the end
