goldfinger is gold bond perhaps teething just a tad over the top , goldfinger , unlike its two predecessors brought to the screen a polished , gourmet spy in james bond . no other cinematic spy comes close to sean connery 's james bond as portrayed in goldfinger . this movie has everything , beautiful and sexy women , cool cars , villainous villains , gadgets-gadgets-gadgets , surprises , and sean connery . the plot became the standard in bond formulas , much to all of our chagrins , but the story is pretty close to the original novel released by ian fleming in 1959 . this is easily the best secret-agent spy movie ever made , and for many reasons . it is cinematically beautiful . it has much daring-do for bond to get in and out of . the music is incredibly on target and set the stage for all bond movies to follow . the women are incredible . the level of acting is top notch , from all performers . in fact , one of the great things about this film is that gerte frobe , who plays goldfinger , did n't speak of word of english , and his lines are dubbed in , but you would never know it by watching the movie . such an incredible flick . highly recommended . that is , if there is a single person out there over the age of 18 who has not yet seen this masterpiece
