the life of tito the biography of yugoslavian leader josip broz tito could have been presented in many different ways , taking into account different literary portrayals of this truly great statesman of the 20th century . there is no doubt that tito had a multitude of enemies , but the number of his friends was even greater . i was a child when tito died , but i witnessed the truly heartwrenching outpour of grief among common people of yugoslavia - from slovenia in the northwest , to macedonia in the southeast ( or as a yugoslavian song says , from vardar to triglav , from djerdap to the adriatic ) . i will never forget that stunning sight . it is that much more sad that tito has been much maligned by the radical nationalists , and even more sad that the common people who once cried for him now rejected the memory of him . tito is often portrayed as a communist - there is no doubt that he was the leader of the yugoslavian communist party . but above all , tito was a nationalist , fighting for the southern slav peoples of the balkan peninsula . not many westerners know that tito never allowed stalin to absorb yugoslavia into his eastern bloc , or warsaw pact . tito , along with nehru and nasser , was the founder of the non-aligned movement . the world , not just yugoslavia , lost a great man on may 4th , 1980 at 3:05pm , when tito succumbed to illness in a hospital in ljubljana , slovenia , just short of his 88th birthday . the world needs more leaders like him , leaders who truly strive to unite and spread peace . so , indeed , may he rest in peace
