great if you 're just starting i 'm just starting out . i have tried to get into other video workouts and i just ca n't . i screw up every dance maneuver or `` walking '' based move they throw at me . debbie does the workout so that i ( as a complete clutz and i hate exercise because i feel stupid that i 'm not coordinated ) feel like i can do it again . i like her telling me about coaching because i need it . if you need encouragement for getting started this is a great place to start . there is also a 50 min . cd you can use for outdoors . i do n't need cute or chatty or some aerobic glam girl . this is a great place to start . i ca n't see myself doing only this video , but give it a go . it 's definately motivated me for 5 days solid .
