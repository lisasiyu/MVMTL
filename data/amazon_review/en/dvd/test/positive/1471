one of the best adpatations of a novel to a film & quot ; mother night & quot ; in not one of my favorite vonnegut novels , but the film adaptation is superb . this is one of the best adaptations i 've ever seen from page to screen , and extremely thought provoking . i give it my highest recommendation
