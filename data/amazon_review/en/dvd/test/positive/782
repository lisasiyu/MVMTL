excellent workout my piano teacher first introduced me to pilates and i do some kind of pilates workout almost every day now . i absolutely love to do pilates , unlike regular exercise . ( i do not love to exercise . no running , no weight lifting , no biking , ect . ) i never felt the need to exercise because i am small and naturally very thin , but i started to realize that even though i 'm thin , i was not very strong and in terrible shape . i started to do the exercises on the beginners dvd and it was much harder than i expected . i woke up the next day with sore muscles ! after a time , my abs started to get stronger and my awareness of what was going on in my body and the way i was breathing was much more alert . i also really like the alternate workout - the 'energy boost ' - a fifteen minutes energy workout . it is absolutely perfect for days when i have a lot going on , or if i just do n't feel like doing pilates for an hour . i can just do the quick workout , and i 'm set for the day . now i 'm hooked on pilates and although i 'm sad to say it is the only exercise i do , at least i 'm in better shape than i was
