fulcis blood drenched classic lucio fulcis zombi 2 is in my opinion the greatest zombie movie ever made [ dawn of the dead is a close second ] and should be in every horror fans collection . people say that its a rip off of romeros films , but doesnt every zombie film take something from night or dawn of the dead . romero basicaly created the whole undead zombie genre . fulcis picture is actually quite original . the setting being in the tropical islands of south america is very effective . the zombies look amazing , much better than romeros blue shaded gut munchers . fulcis zombies are rotting , decaying monsters . each one has its own original qualities . the only thing i dont love about the movie is the pacing . it takes like 40 minutes for the film to get going , but once it does get going its a nonstop zombie gorefest . speaking of gore , zombi 2 has plenty of it . the wooden splinter through the eye scene is to this day one of the most infamous gore scenes ever put onto film . if you havnt seen this movie then you should first punch youself in the face and then go buy it immediatly .
