one of jackie 's best this is a really enjoyable film . the action is great , the comic timing perfect , the stunts amazing . i 'm stumped by how hollywood can decide to release twin dragons when there are such great jackie classics as project a 1 and 2 , drunken master 1 and 2 , police story 1 and 2
