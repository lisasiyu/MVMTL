`` sometimes truth defies reason . '' the meiks brothers had a troubled childhood . very troubled . their mother had died after adam was born , leaving his older brother fenton to take care of him with the help of their father . the three males seemed to fend well for themselves , not running into too many bumps in their simple yet strange road in life . it was a fairly close-knit family with plenty of pleasant memories and more to come . but all of that changed one night when dad ( curiously , his name was never revealed in the film , being credited as `` dad meiks '' ) rushed into the boys ' room , flipped on the light , woke them up , and began to unravel an unusual tale that would change the very course of their lives in a most dramatic way . dad had been visited by an angel - an angel sent by god himself . the heavenly apparition told him of his new calling : to be a destroyer of demons . according to the angel , the biblical end times had come and there were demons of hell now walking among mortal man , disguised as humans . dad would be given sacred weapons from the angel soon , and thereafter he would receive a list . the list held the names of the demons in disguise - names that appeared to be mere human identities , but , just like the demons themselves , were simply cover-ups for the true evil that lurked in their soul . it was now up to this family of three to become warriors of god . the young adam obeyed his father and came to believe every bit of it . but fenton was disturbed by these ideas , insisting to himself that his father had lost his mind and nothing this crazy could be real . yet surely enough , step by step , it all began becoming a reality . the main slaughtering weapon had been retrieved - an abandoned axe in an old shed , with gloves by its side . they came to find out , that the gloves were for dad to use when capturing the demons and bringing them back to the house . because when he would remove the gloves and touch them with his bare hands , he could see their dark sin nature and know for sure who they really were . they were n't humans of course , they were pathetic demons - no match for the wrath of god that was being handed out through this divinely chosen man and his sons . at first fenton wanted to run away and get help . but as time moved on , trapped within this world of madness and extremism , he began to question his reality as a whole . could he brake away from this terrible mess he 'd been drawn into , or was he destined to become a demon-slayer , just as his father was , and just as his brother would come to be ? years later , as a full-grown adult , he gets a frantic phone call from his brother . shortly after , he decides to give fbi agent wesley doyle a visit and finally relieve himself of these secrets that have plagued him all his life . at first doyle is confused as to why he would come to him to reveal the mystery behind the `` god 's hand '' serial killer case . yet once he unveils this deranged tale and the story progresses , they take a trip to the burial site of the victims , where reality warps and warps until it all comes into focus . it turns out that the truth is more twisted than the viewer could have ever imagined . 2001 's frailty is a dark web beautifully spun by it 's makers and deserves a look from any and every fan of suspense and horror films . it 's a clever , disturbing , thought-provoking piece with plenty of twists and turns that will leave you impressed - if not a bit creeped out ! starring bill paxton , mathew mcconaughey , and powers booth ( among others ) you can be assured that the acting really brings out the depth and haunting minds of the characters . and with a great script and crew work , it 's no wonder why this is one of the best films in years for fans of the genre . not to mention several nice extras on the dvd ( including deleted scenes , documentaries/featurettes , and commentary by director/actor bill paxton ) . for sure , frailty is a winner all the way
