a parable about our current relationship to islam . this is a very entertaining dvd , full of action with very well constructed and filmed battle scenes of great scope . in some ways the film is very timely considering that there is a tension between the current western civilization of america and europe and the islamic world that stretches across asia . i found it interesting that the film depicts those christians who are tolerant of a multicultural and diverse nation with those christians that are not tolerant of other 's religious beliefs . in this film , balian ( played by orlando bloom ) , his father , and the king of jerusalem ( a pitiful leper hiding behind a silver mask ) represent those forces that can live with diversity of spiritual beliefs . the templar knights represent those forces that can not live with diversity and multiculturalism for it threatens them . in this film , the muslims are a powerful military force that also is diverse in tolerance or non-tolerance for christians . it is a beautiful film , with fascinating architecture , set construction , and weapon and costume design . the battle for the city of jerusalem is exciting , a dramatic high point , and a critical aspect of the film . saladin wins the battle and jerusalem is handed over to the muslims . remember that after the death of jesus , the apostles and disciples spread christianity into egypt and ethiopia , into rome , france , spain , england , and ireland . also christianity was spread into eastern europe such as romania , hungary , germany . christianity was spread into present day syria , jordan , iraq , and iran . thus the sweep of islam across the world in around the year 600 brought islam to christian communities and cities across the middle east . it is in response to this growing islamic power and dominance over the middle east for 700 years that the crusades were waged - which is a primary theme of the film . yet this is not a christians hate muslims who in turn hate christians type of film . instead the writers and film-makers imply that the kingdom of heaven is attainable here on earth through the belief in tolerance for other 's beliefs about god . this is actually a good message for our day and time - which director ridley scott obviously knows
