funny i do n't understand a lot of the criticism of the yes men by other reviewers . i mean , all the right-wing reviews are to be expected ( `` flaming '' is what amazon 's user reviews are all about is n't it ? ! ) . so , obviously , that 's a given . but all the 2 and 3 star people who were like `` i did n't find it funny '' and `` too much talking '' and what not , that 's what i do n't get . i found the movie terribly funny . even the benign banter whilst driving around or prepping i found funny . but the scene where they present in `` the suit '' ... man , i was almost crying it was so funny . and as for the `` what 's the point ! ? '' criticisms , all i can say is : by that logic , what 's the point of anything ? i mean , what do you want ? it 's a movie ? the best it can hope for is to inspire the viewer . in this case either to act , or to possibly feel like there is a little bit of hope in the world since the only audience to challenge their right-wing , lassie fare , free-unmitigated-trade-to-the-max insanity are the college kids ( aka the future policy makers ) , and because the one time they present the more positive ideas of the left , their audience of economists ( who you 'd expect to hate it ) all express such joy at someone finally taking a stand for what they know to be right , but never get to talk about . if this is the gauge by which you judge success or failure of what a film should do , i think it succeeds admirably . in short , i thought the yes men was very funny . on netflix ( where *accurate* star ratings are helpful , not silly ones , like in this venue ) , i gave it 4 stars . i gave it 5 here because i want to try to offset some of the 1 star people
