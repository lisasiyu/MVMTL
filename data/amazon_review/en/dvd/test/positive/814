new line from the criterion collection ! as a film programmer & movie fan , i 'm very psyched about the new eclipse line from the criterion collection . what better start than these early titles by bergman . it looks like more great things to come , so keep your eye out . even without the many extras , etc , the eclipse catalog will finally make available many rare films that have been waiting for dvd release . thank you , criterion
