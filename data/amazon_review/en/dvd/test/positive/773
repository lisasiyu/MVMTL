interesting short film for any disney or animation buff this is a very well done documentary that offers some insight into the rise and ( currently ) dramatic fall of disney animation . if you follow disney news at all , the documentary does not reveal anything that you probably do not already know . what the documentary does do , however , is put faces and personal stories to the facts . my only complaint was that it was a little short . it would have been nice to see what the animator 's `` post disney '' plans were
