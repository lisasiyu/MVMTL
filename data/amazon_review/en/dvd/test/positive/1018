comedy for paranoids `` the president 's analyst '' is a pleasant surprise . it 's a consistently amusing cold-war comedy that lightly tweaks at everyone 's most paranoid fears about espionage , government beauracracy , and monopolistic public utilities among other things . being the sixties , it also sends up suburban liberals , hippies , and yes , psycho-therapy . james coburn is brilliant as the analyst who finds that taking on the job as the president 's analyst makes him the target of competing interests , some benevolent and some not so . the movie really takes hold when his paranoia starts to set in . good supporting cast that includes godfrey cambridge as a u.s. spy and severn darden as an affable soviet spy . my favorite bit has to involve william daniels as the gun-toting self-proclaimed suburban liberal
