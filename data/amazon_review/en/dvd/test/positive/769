this is a long ride , ese ... are you ready ? blood in , blood out ( a.k.a . `` bound by honor '' ) is a bit of a surprise . while it incorporates many of the predictable elements of a barrio crime film , it is also just different enough to keep you hanging in there . for example , this film has the best location shots of east l.a . i think i 've ever seen , and the whole movie has the look of authenticity . this is no illusion ; the prison scenes were filmed in san quentin , and there are only eight actors used for them . this adds interest as you try to spot the `` real '' actors behind bars . ( hint : the convict who looks like billy bob thornton is billy bob thornton . ) another one of the non-cons is hispanic poet jimmy santiago baca ; he plays the member of la onda with a heavily pruned mustache . baca co-wrote this screenplay , and it 's clear that he 's unaccustomed to the traditional story arcs of mainstream film . that 's not to the project 's detriment , but it does mean that you have to sit through the first half-hour of the movie before its promise starts to be revealed . in other words , this movie 's bad acting and melodramatic music score are at their worst in the early going . perhaps this is intentional ; blood in , blood out means it 's hard to get in the gang , and it 's not easy bailing from it either ; the same is true for the viewer watching this movie . and just like joining a gang , you 're making a real commitment here , as the film is well over three hours long . ( in its original form , it was well over five hours long ! ) sidelight : i 've never heard `` ese '' ( pronounced `` ess-ay '' ) so many times in my life ; be sure to have the subtitles on to understand the spanglish slang .
