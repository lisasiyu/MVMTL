being there just a wonderful vehicle for peter sellers . it not only illustrates his comedic abilities , but also the strength of his straight acting . there is a wonderful cameo from shirley maclaine , and the supporting cast are exactly that . this is a heart-warming , yet on deeper consideration quite sad film - 'what if ... ... ? ' , and i rate it highly
