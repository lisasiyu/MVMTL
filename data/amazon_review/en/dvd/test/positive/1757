warning : this performance is addictive ! i 've been a big fan of jean luc ponty and stanley clarke for years . i 've owned the `` rite of strings '' cd for a couple of years and find it quite unique and enjoyable . the music is very complex both in composition and execution . that is , you wonder how 3 guys can produce all this complex sound . i recently purchased this dvd and have watched it with great delight several times . seeing the music performed is quite illuminating . i have a new , great appreaciation for al dimeola ! for all you guitarists , this is a must-see performance ! his ovation guitar has the most beautiful , clear , bright sound and his playing is unbelievable . the sound quality of the dvd is fantastic and the camera work contributes significantly . in fact , i would rate the camera work on this dvd at the top of my list . you are treated to up close fingerwork as well as shots showing the interplay between the performers . this performance dvd will blow you away
