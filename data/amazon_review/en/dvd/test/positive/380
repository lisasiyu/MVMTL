throne of blood ... . i was enormously fascinated by the film `` the throne of blood '' we just watched as part of our pre-ap english course in nagoya international school , japan . the film adopts the plot of shakespeare 's macbeth with a japanese setting . macbeth is characterized as a japanese warrior , the head of the 1st fort . after the victory , he sees a spirit ( the witch-equivalent ) in the forest on his way to the shogun 's castle . as he has predicted , he was awarded the prestigious status of the head of the castle . the king decided to visit his castle one day to organize a plan to kill the banquo-equivalent character . he is extremely proud of the trust that the king has in order to arrange such an important event , but his wife believes that the king insists on killing him instead . the big gap between his optimism and his wife 's pessimism leads him to the road of tragedy . i believe the director of the film could easily adopt the setting very similar to that of the original macbeth , thanks to the similarities in the feudal system of japan and scotland . japan also believed in the existence of spirits and how the nobleman was ranked in status was similar to that of scotland . kurosawa would 've struggled creating the throne of blood if he , for example , adopted dynastic china or the kingdom of thailand as the scene instead of japan . all of the characters in `` the throne of blood '' successfully and accurately emulated the characters in the shakespearean version . although there were some changes in their persona ( such as the lady macbeth character was a more modest figure than the original ) , all characters kept their qualities , tendencies and their role . to people whom read macbeth in the past , this movie is definitely worth the watch . viewers can receive the same impression and the excitement of macbeth with a totally different setting . koy
