watch it for the fonz and kathy bates performances this movie reminded me of a spoof of 'forrest gump ' . i have no idea if it was intended that or not . i choose to look at it that way because that is the only way that this could ever possibly be funny . however , the real jokes are that tom hanks took the same material and impressed critics and audiences with his acting skills while adam sandler just amused a few people who watched this film . the other joke in the film is adam sandler 's voice . he kept changing it . first , he had a mild southern accent , then he just began talking slower and faking a stutter . regardless , i got a slight chuckle from the idea of him trying to fake a voice to sound stupid . his real voice would have fit all too perfectly
