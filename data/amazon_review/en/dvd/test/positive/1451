one of the best films ever made . i remember seeing this film as a young girl , and its impact has never left me . this is one of those films that is not well known so naturally it gets overlooked . this movie is truly scary in the sense that it plays with your emotions . sure friday the thirteenth , halloween , etc . are scary , but they rely on superficial violence and gore to lure their viewers . this film touches the human psyche ; it brings out a realization that not all people are good and that there is pure evil in all places . when a film can touch a person deep inside , that makes it an unforgettable classic . i would recommend anyone , expect very young children , to view this jewel of a film .
