oh , my , my ... it 's obvious from reading so many of the reviews of 'happy feet ' , what 's wrong with this country . really , people ... get a life ! it 's a perfect reflection of our political climate , that a certain sector of the population is so wound-up , pent-up , angry , frustrated ( and in so many ways ) , that they take it out on a bunch of harmless cartoon characters . i suppose this indicates that the angry rage over tele-tubbies has reached an end . my , this country has become a strange , dark place . all that aside , i loved this movie , and ca n't think of a legitimate reason not to let your children see it . smile ... it wo n't break you .
