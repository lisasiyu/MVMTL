a good movie all the lives of the saints are great , which is what makes it difficult to rate movies of their lives . you would think that the movie would naturally deserve five stars , but that is n't always the case . in rating a movie on the life of a saint , what is really being rated is the presentation of their life . this presentation of the life of st. francis of assisi is deserving of five stars because it shows the viewer how st. francis embodied true conversion , faith , hope , and love . despite this , however , i do have this criticism : the heart of st. francis ' spiritual life was the eucharistic sacrifice of the mass . shockingly , however , the movie does not portray this at all ! this criticism also applies to the recent movie on the life of st. anthony of padua , which i would likewise give five stars . these two saints wold sometimes live only off of the `` food which endures to eternal life '' ( jn 6:27 ) ! yet one wold not at all get this from the movies . this is a major disappointment . nevertheless , though , the movie still deserves five stars , for without the gifts of repentance , faith , hope , and love , the eucharist would be received in vain
