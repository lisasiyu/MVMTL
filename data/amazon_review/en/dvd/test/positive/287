not the best season but still gets the job done scrubs continues it 's trek onward from it 's humble beginnings in the third season . the first season revolved around everything from jd coping with being a doctor , to turk and carla beginning their relationship , to jd and elliot 's crazy relationship . season two continued from there and even expanding upon it . jd and elliot hooked up again . turk and carla became even more close . dr. cox even gets thrown in the mix a lot more with the storyline of him getting back with jordan . that brings us to season three . following up on two tremendous season is n't easy and they , in my opinion , succumb to the pressure somewhat . of the three seasons released on dvd so far , this season is my least favorite . never fear though . season three still has plenty of laughs , plenty of guest appearances ( michael j . fox will probably go down as my favorite ) , and you get to know the entire cast even more . all these things make for a memorable season , but in some cases they seem to have backed themselves into a corner . there 's more than a fair share of laughs along the way , be it the janitor becoming a security guard , cox dealing with his child , turk and carla basically becoming one person ( funnier than it sounds ) , elliot 's rekindling flame of season one 's sean , and jd 's continued troubles of being a doctor/lover . everything is funny , just a notch below seasons one and two . overall , yes , this could 've been better ( episode wise , extras are amazing as always ) , but i 'm still happy with what we 've been given . the cliffhanger is a good one and i look forward to seeing even more scenarios continued in season four 's dvd release
