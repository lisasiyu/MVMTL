brilliant ; brilliant ; brilliant . where this ranks in the woody allen opus , according to those who know , i would n't care to say ; but for me it 's the tops , up with the purple rose of cairo . this is an incredibly witty and delightful work , impeccably crafted in every direction . it is deeply subtle and philosophical : there is nothing shallow about its satire . it is also extremely funny . i laughed a lot , a very lot . maybe that supremely flat , deadpan humour , sustained to the nth degree , particularly appeals to an english sensibility . the ingenuity and accuracy of the antique filming and acting styles , and the staging of the musical numbers is astounding . incidentally , that was n't really hitler at the rally , with zelig behind him , was it ? i thought that was the hollywood version of the zelig life story : the versions merged -- - the documentary became fiction , and vice versa . eudora 's mother stole the show .
