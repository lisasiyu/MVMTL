murder , she wrote : season three it took me only two weeks to watch all 22 episodes of `` murder , she wrote '' - the complete third season . and my review is basically the same as it was with seasons one and two : just more mystery fun with angela lansbury as famed mystery author and crime solver jessica fletcher . familiar faces from the little screen to the big screen stopped by for guest appearences in season three , including recent `` syriana '' oscar winner george clooney , past oscar winners ernest borgnine ( `` the poseidon adventure '' ) and martin balsam ( `` psycho '' ) , `` friends '' alum courtney cox arquette , `` brady bunch '' veterans florence henderson and barry williams , veteran comic buddy hackett , and `` naked gun '' star leslie nielsen . other guest stars include : gloria stuart ( `` titanic '' ) , g.w . bailey ( `` police academy '' ) , tess harper ( `` tender mercies '' ) , jessica walter ( `` arrested development '' ) , hayley mills ( `` the parent trap '' ) , bill macy ( `` maude '' ) , genie francis ( `` general hospital '' ) , dinah manoff ( `` empty nest '' ) , and harry morgan ( `` m*a*s*h '' ) . three stars from the `` star trek '' tv shows turned up for guest appearences : george takei ( the original `` star trek '' series ) , levar burton ( `` star trek : the next generation '' ) , and kate mulgrew ( `` star trek : voyager '' ) . erin moran , best known for playing joannie on the popular '70s sitcom `` happy days '' , guest starred in the third episode of season three titled `` unfinished business '' , which reunited her with `` happy days '' co-star tom bosley , who had a reoccuring role during the first couple of seasons of `` murder , she wrote '' as amos tupper , the sheriff of jessica fletcher 's hometown of cabot cove , maine ( i 've very much enjoyed bosley 's appearences on `` murder , she wrote '' as well as william windom 's reoccuring appearences as cabot cove doctor seth hazlitt ) . and in an interesting scenario , tom selleck and john hillerman turn up in their `` magnum p.i . '' roles as part of a cross-over episode , with this particular storyline starting out on an episode of `` magnum p.i . '' ( which was in its seventh season ) and concluding with an episode of `` murder , she wrote '' ( episode # 8 to be exact ) . that episode of `` magnum p.i . '' is featured as a bonus on season three of `` murder , she wrote '' . the `` magnum p.i . `` / '' murder , she wrote '' cross-over episodes ( titled `` novel connection '' and `` magnum on ice '' ) were a favorite of mine . other great episodes from season three include : `` death stalks the big top '' parts 1 and 2 , `` unfinished business '' , `` obituary for a dead anchor '' , `` the corpse flew first class '' , `` crossed up '' , `` simon says , color me dead '' , `` no laughing murder '' , `` no accounting for murder '' , and `` murder , she spoke '' . `` murder , she wrote '' season three is great fun for fans of mystery and crime , and lansbury is wonderful as usual . i 'm sure the fun will continue with season four !
