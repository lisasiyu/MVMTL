4 not a 5 this film looked and sounded great . it was an angelina jolie movie but it just was n't what i expected . i come from the time were lara croft was controlled by your fingure tips so i do n't think they captured my lara croft tomb raider . it is still a film i have seen in standard and own in hd . the hd looks great . the film itself just did n't do it for me . they really did n't capture the essence of tomb raider
