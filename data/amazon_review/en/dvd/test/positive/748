season 2 blazes ahead and makes season 1 look like nothing ! season 2 of this fantastic 80s detective series brings a new feel to the show . most notably , murphy and bernice fox are gone , and replaced by doris roberts ( now known more for playing marie barone on everybody loves raymond ) . it is likely that the writers determined that murphy was leading the show into `` love triangle '' territory in season 1 , and that fans just wanted remington and laura to be together without the complications . at the same time , bernice fox seemed to serve no purpose beyond appearing at the desk whenever the lobby was shown . so , they combined the two into ms. krebs , a character who could fill the role of secretary , while also occasionally appearing outside the office without posing a threat to the steele/holt relationship . while murph and fox are missed , doris roberts shines in the role , especially in the later seasons . unfortunately , the season begins with an hour-and-a-half episode that is almost a chore to sit through . in a seeming attempt to bring to mind the james bond feel of exotic locations , the composer even went so far as to score a theme for the action scenes that is so obviously a combination of the original bond theme and the melody of from russia with love . this season opener is the beginning of the `` exotic locale '' episodes , and increasingly over the next three seasons we would see the team travel to mexico , malta , britain , ireland . . . i never really cared for these episodes . i preferred them staying in la with the pretty night ligths and almost noirish atmosphere . at any rate , things pick up in the second episode as laura comes under personal attack so unrelenting , that it costs her a house ! a scene midway with laura staring blankly at the burning rubble as she musters the strength to carry on is an early performance high for the fantastic stephanie zimbalist . brosnan himself would shine a few episodes later when framed for a murder he did n't commit . this episode inroduces a recurring character who proves to be quite a foil to the pair . also introduced this season is the vintage auburn automobile , which would get an entire episode devoted to its own mystery before becoming a regular fixture on the show . all told , season 2 manages to grow the potential of the show beyond the `` mystery of the week '' that was season 1 . we really get to explore with more depth what makes both characters work - and with murphy out of the way , steele is free to become a little more macho and self-assured . but do not worry - there is still enough of the slightly-bumbling cary grant style that makes him so lovable ! my only real complaint with this season is that the writers never really seemed to be clear on where the `` relationship '' between the two was headed . they might have a major romance scene in one episode , then have no romance for a stretch of four or five - and then suddenly be close again . after awhile , the relationship becomes frankly boring , and the stories take center stage . however , it is still great tv , and another well-produced dvd set for the money . as before , the handful of 10-minute documentary shorts are spread throughout the four discs , and are nostalgiac and quick paced so as to be enjoyed without being overlong . all told , this is a worthy set - and no , i 'm not going to say it 's a steele at any price ! that 's getting old now !
