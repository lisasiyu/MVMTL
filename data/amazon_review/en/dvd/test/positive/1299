the truth about tibet i visited tibet last summer and experienced the amazing tibetan people and culture which are rapidly disappearing because of the chinese . i stayed at a monastery that was slowly being rebuilt after being destroyed and the rinpoche murdered in the 1950s . this beautiful and well-made film documented all that happened to the tibetans during the cultural revolution and made me cry . why has the west turned its back on tibet
