a sultry femme fatale , entertaining plot , but no depth . `` dead reckoning '' is a story told half in flashback by captain rip murdock ( humphrey bogart ) , a paratrooper just returned from combat in world war ii . in the southern town of gulf city , murdock is beaten up and on the run . eluding his pursuers , he enters a church and tells his story to a priest so that , whatever may come , someone will know : a few days before , murdock and a paratrooper under his command , sergeant johnny drake ( william prince ) , were whisked home from paris and put on a train to washington , d.c. , where sgt . drake was to receive the congressional medal of honor . but drake took off while the train was stopped , and murdock set out to find him . he followed drake to gulf city , where he discovered that drake was a fugitive before he enlisted , having confessed to the murder of his girlfriend 's husband . murdock finds the girlfriend , coral chandler ( lizabeth scott ) , in a nightclub owned by a man named martinelli ( morris carnovsky ) , who has a mysterious hold over coral . `` dead reckoning '' is entertaining but not thematically sophisticated . the dialogue is fine , but not clever or sharp . the character writing is superficial . this is n't top-tier film noir , but it does have humphrey bogart 's charisma and lizabeth scott 's sultry voice and great looks . coral chandler is one of the most manipulative femme fatales in film noir . in fact , she is the center of the film 's only discernible theme : you ca n't trust women . i 've rarely seen a film with such an overt anti-female premise . normally i find femme fatales to be a refreshingly unsentimental image of women . but murdock is relentless in proclaiming women to be deceitful and castigating coral . -and he falls under her spell anyway . so it 's all very amusing . `` dead reckoning '' is n't a great film , but it 's solid entertainment with high-power stars . the dvd ( columbia/tristar 2002 ) : the print of the film is good , but not restored . there are some small white specks , but not enough to be distracting . bonus features include `` the bogart collection '' ( 4 minutes ) , which is scrolling text about bogart 's career followed by some posters of his films . `` vintage advertising '' is 3 posters for the film . subtitles for the film are available in english , japanese , french , spanish , portuguese , and korean
