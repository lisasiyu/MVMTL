calming this dvd is mostly just stretching but its very relaxing . her voice is calming and gentle but a little strange , takes some getting use to . it kinda freaks me out for the first few minutes every time i put it in ! this is the dvd i like to use before i go to my yoga class for some reason . i guess because of all the stretching it really loosens ya up . she uses different poses than most other dvds which is nice for a change . a great one to have in your library . beautiful scenery also
