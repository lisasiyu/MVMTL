operation thunderball after a one-film hiatus spectre returns . so has sean connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of james bond in goldfinger . terence young is also back as director . however , he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that guy hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of goldfinger . due to that film 's success young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen . young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be . the film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted . adolfo celi as emilio largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to bond . in fact he seems to lose every encounter with bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs. guns . bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target . what makes the film very memorable is john barry 's rich score and lamar boren 's beautiful and colorful underwater photography . the two went hand in hand . i also thought the villains ' plot to hijack a vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed . this film has a very british feel to as it should have . this film has always been a favourite with diving and snorkeling enthusiasts . i met a very young couple this summer at the beach club . i happened to mention james bond . these two half my age immediately said , `` thunderball ! '' do you like `` thunderball ? '' i replied , `` absolutely . and by the way i see you are drinking red stripe beer . did you know that when bond tosses quarrel into those corrugated cartons in dr. no those are cases of red stripe beer ? '' and so i met some new bond fans . as for the dvd , i liked the fact that they re-mastered the film in stereo , but it somehow is too overbearing in spots . i also liked the end titles on the british version much better with the original music that barry had scored for this sequence . all that being said , i still always liked this film .
