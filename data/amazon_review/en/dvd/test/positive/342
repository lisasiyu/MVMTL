moving and inspiring , not matter what the final verdict was ... i 've heard a lot good and a lot bad about this film . i do n't think anyone can deny the power in denzel 's brilliant performance , but as far as the accuracy of the film is concerned , it 's been judged harshly for it . i personally do n't know the truth behind this mans conviction , his innocence and his quilt , only he knows , but the portrait painted by this film portrays rubin `the hurricane ' carter as a victim of a corrupt system . to me it 's a very moving film , regardless if it 's true or not , and in the eyes of the actors involved it truly grips and draws you into this mans fight for freedom . denzel delivers his finest performance here ; a well deserved oscar nomination , and proves that he is a very talented actor . i am a fan of denzel , although i 've made my concern very clear ( the fact that denzel at times seems to only excel when playing these types of characters ) , and i feel he shines here . despite the constant criticism , i feel this is a must-see film , if not for the emotional , albeit somewhat fictionalized ( or assumed is a better word since no one really knows ) , story then for the brilliant acting on the part of everyone involved . dan hedeya does a great job as the crooked ( fictional ) detective who makes it his life goal to punish rubin for a crime he committed as a child ( a crime that should never have been considered a crime ) and vicellous reon shannon does wonderfully as lesra , the young man who not only fights for rubin 's freedom but helps rubin to regain the hope and life he once had . like i said , very heartwarming and touching , and regardless of whether or not rubin was guilty or innocent , the basic story of his fight for survival and the love and support he received from lesra and his companions is true and that act of human love and spirit is a joy to see
