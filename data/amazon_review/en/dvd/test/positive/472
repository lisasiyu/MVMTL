the governator shows his soft side this movie gets spoofed in jibjab 's short film `` ah-nold for governor '' in which the governator cites the movie as evidence of his gubernatorial political qualifications . hey , it 's a lot more convincing than john kerry 's . especially since this movie is so irresistible . you just have to see the scene in which john kimble reads the kids a poem about clouds . ( incidentally , it 's spring morning '' from a.a. milne 's book , `` when we were very young . '' ) schwarzenegger displays a richard belzer kind of tenderness . then he will turn around and beat the living daylights out of the abusive father in the film ( `` he fell down . you all say the same thing . '' ) kimble 's relationship with grace is moving and convincing and his camaraderie with his female partner phoebe is evocative of detectives benson and stabler in `` law & order : svu '' . i love the scene in which he makes up an entire background ( something cops are used to doing ) and phoebe pretends to have an austrian accent ( she 's almost more convincing than ah-nold . ) the childrens ' loyalty and response to kimble is a joy to see . schwarzenegger 's work with children and his natural charisma make this fish-out-of-water story work . anyone who 's ever taught children will empathize with kimble 's disastrous first day . there are great villains in this piece too , including a mother-in-law from hell . my favorite lines ... phoebe : you 're not so tough without your car , are you ? detective john kimble : there *is* no bathroom . joseph : boys have a penis , girls have a vagina ! detective john kimble : thanks for the tip . tina & rina : our mom says our dad is a real sex machine . joseph : my dad 's a gynecologist . he looks at vaginas all day long . detective john kimble : i have a headache . lowell : it might be a tumor . detective john kimble : it 's not a tumor ! miss schlowski : what did it feel like to hit that s.o.b. ? detective john kimble : it felt great . ( i love how the principal then starts practicing her right hook once kimble leaves her office . you do n't want to mess with this woman anyway , right hook or no . ) detective john kimble : just do n't throw up on me . phoebe : nah , it 's ok , i 'm not gon na throw up on you . but i am gon na kiss you ! detective john kimble : i really appreciate your honesty . you happen to know someone that is not better than me ? dominic : i do n't know that many people . detective john kimble : they 're 6-year-old kids . how much trouble can they be ? phoebe : on second thought , take the gun . crisp 's mother is buying a heap of pediatric medication cullen crisp : the boy 's not sick . eleanor crisp : does n't hurt to take precautions . cullen crisp : mother , you are going to make him sick . you stuffed all this crap down my throat for years , and there was nothing wrong with me ! eleanor crisp : that 's why there was nothing wrong with you . cullen crisp : now , how can you argue with that ? great comedy .
