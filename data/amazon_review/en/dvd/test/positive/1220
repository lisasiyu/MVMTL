i worked up a sweat with this one . this is a good cardio/interval weight training workout . the entire workout is 40 minutes in length . you will need 3 to 5 pound dumbbells for the toning segments ( there are 2 or 3 incorporated into the cardio workout ) . the instructor leads you through some classic aerobic moves then goes into one of the weight training segments in which you will still keep the entire body moving to keep the heart rate up . the kickboxing segment is good too . there is a standing abs with weights segment near the end but she does n't do any classic floor crunches . this workout had me sweating ! it took a couple of times for me to get the routines down , but it seems to be a good cardio workout to add to your fitness dvd rotations .
