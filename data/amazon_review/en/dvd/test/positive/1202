you will not find a better movie version of 1984 naturally any film media can not place the entire book on the screen with maybe the exception of `` hamlet '' ( 1996 ) . with anything less than a mini-series . second is it the story or the philosophy that needs to be transmitted ? if you are lucky you get both . in this case we are lucky because both the basic story and the basic philosophy were transmitted in this movie . an added plus , you could say double plus good , was the portraying the environment as a period piece as described in the book and not as some modern version . the story `` 1984 '' was envisioned in 1948 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - in a society that has eliminated many imbalances , surplus goods , and even class struggle , there are bound to be deviates ; winston smith ( john hurt ) is one of those . he starts out , due to his inability to doublethink , with thoughtcrime . this is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed . eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex ( suzanna hamilton ) and with the help of an encouraging inter party member ( richard burton ) even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan . if he gets caught , he will be sent to the `` ministry of love '' where they have a record of 100 % cures for this sort of insanity . they will even forgive his past indiscretions . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - this version is a little more graphic than the other two earlier commercial movies . however each movie version brings a different emphasis on this classic story . there is a 2007 version in the works read a review of the book `` 1984 '' by george orwell . the movie can stand on its own merit , but knowledge of the book will help fill in the gaps and explain the inferences . better actors could not have been picked . richard burton is in his element . many people think this is happening today .
