we still love rocky i figured i would watch this movie on a lark ... we all know the jokes about rocky and infinite sequels . the days leading up before i saw the movie , i would chant `` rocky , rocky '' to my girlfriend ( not a fan ) . i was all but prepared for the comic spoofs i was going to make afterward ... but then something happened . as i watched the movie all jokes feel aside when i realized that this was the best rocky ever ! there was a depth and maturity to this movie , probably because we fans have been following the lives of these characters for over 30 years . there was almost an intimate documentary like quality to the picture . one can almost see themselves in philly , going up to rocky and shaking his hand . this character is that real . when you watch this final installment , you will realize why you originally were drawn to the rocky movies and character 30 years ago . rocky is all about heart and the triumph of the human spirit . and he is all about being true to himself and this movie is all about being true to the fans . check out this movie .
