the darker side of comedy born romantic cuts a slice of life out of london life that includes a myriad of characters all of whom border on pathological types . and it is this very aspect which makes this tasty little film so addictive . the homing center for these disparate people is a salsa club and whether they are committed to the dance routine or not , they weave in and out of each others lives with the salsa music as the glue . one woman is a grave decorator with anatomical phobias in abundance , another is a bisexual who fears relationships , another is leaping toward the bed the moment she meets a new male . the men are equally edgy , from a scotsman who pines for a truly classy woman , to a atm robber , to a wonderfully warm taxi driver who serves as a paterfamilias and has the only clear view in the bunch . how they all eventually find each other is the point of hte journey . the acting is excellent , the timing first rate , and if you have any difficulty with the various accents of the londoners , just turn on the english subtitles and you wo n't miss a thing . a lovely film full of surprises
