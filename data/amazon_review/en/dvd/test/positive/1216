review of orson welles & quot ; it 's all true & quot ; . a treasure for all welles ' fans . a 32 minute documentary on the failure to complete & quot ; it 's all true & quot ; leads into a full presentation of the beautiful 46 minute b & amp ; w silent drama documentary titled & quot ; four men on a raft & quot ; . an excellent modern ( stereo ) score made up of renditions of the brazilian music welles was investigating is dubbed on together with appropriate sound effects ( wind & amp ; waves etc ) . despite being on nitrate film stock stashed in a studio basement for over 40 years its presented in almost perfect condition . a thrill to see what 's left and truly sad to think of what might have emerged . included amongst the snippets of incomplete material is just 3 minutes b & amp ; w and 3 minutes colour rio carnival footage and a complete 3 minute segment from & quot ; my friend burrito & quot ;
