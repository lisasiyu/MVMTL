it was a great time i thought the 2005 world series collector 's edition was really terrific . i enjoyed every second of it . it really caught all the emotion and suspense of four great ball games . this is one i will be watching over and over again . anyone who is a fan of baseball and particularly a fan of the chicago white sox will want to have this collector 's edition . the 2005 world series was a great one
