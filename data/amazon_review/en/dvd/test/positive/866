well above average southern horror drama is worthy of any tv series collection `american gothic ' , a tv series , is a supernatural drama consisting of 22 episodes , some of which where not aired during the original run . it ran on cbs for one year between 1995 and 1996 . its creator sam raimi had already worked on southern horror projects such as `evil dead i & ii ' and would later go on to direct the southern horror thriller `the gift ' before breaking box office records with his `spider-man ' series success . southern horror is nothing new as stephen king attests using some of his best works as an example , such as `the stand ' . we also have the `children of the corn ' series ( nobody said all southern horror was great ) , the works of david lynch and `frailty ' to name a few of what is a whole dvd section unto itself . apart from the modern `carnivale ' tv series it is hard to find southern horror outside of some `x files ' or `twilight zone ' episodes . the most obvious parallel though is to lynch and `twin peaks ' , and for those who enjoyed peaks , then gothic offers a slightly less satisfying but equally as interesting plot type . gothic is about the town of trinity , deep south southern carolina , that is home to what seems to be the devil himself in the guise of sheriff lucas buck , who in the view of his deputies has never done an honest days police work in his life . buck is creating illegitimate sons in order to sire his successor . caleb temple , an orphan , finds himself caught between his murdered sister 's ghost pleas for revenge while a plot is hatched by buck to turn caleb to the dark side . caleb 's cousin , gail emory and local doctor matt crower , are determined to ensure that caleb does n't fall into the clutches of buck 's psychopathic fatherly lessons . the scene is set for explosive tension between this world and the next . american gothic was aired out of the directors intended sequence by the instances of cbs who also refused to air some episodes . the episodes `` echo of your last goodbye '' and `` strangler '' where not aired . `` potato boy '' and `` ring of fire '' were aired out of sequence . this same inconsistent sequence is presented in the dvd box set . for this reason you need to know the intended viewing order before you watch the dvd . the intended viewing is - `` pilot '' , `` a tree grows in trinity '' , `` eye of the beholder '' , `` damned if you do n't '' , `` potato boy '' , `` dead to the world '' , `` meet the beetles '' , `` strong arm of the law '' , `` to hell and back '' , `` the beast within '' , `` rebirth '' , `` ring of fire '' , `` resurrector '' , `` inhumanitas '' , `` the plague sower '' , `` doctor death takes a holiday '' , `` learning to crawl '' , `` echo of your last goodbye '' , `` strangler '' , `` triangle '' , `` the buck stops here '' and `` requiem '' . compared to peaks , gothic is far more supernatural and slowly burned its way to a specific cult following that did n't generate any ground breaking ratings . a second season of gothic did not appear , however when other stations aired gothic in its intended order the ratings improved . the dvd series is also very popular . there are many reasons to believe that gothic could have been made for extra seasons ( what produ $ er would not ? ) as there are some loose ends , but that is not to say that american gothic does not stand alone as this mini-series , it does and it can . the only real onion is that one of the leads dr. crow ( jake weber ) left the show , or was written out , only a few episodes from the end . apart from these minor production drawbacks american gothic builds slowly but gains a lot of momentum towards the concluding episodes for a mind-blowing supernatural abrahamic type finale on a staircase . if you like a good supernatural tv series and if you like originality with some of the best wit ever scripted and some serious dead pan sarcasm every split second , then look no further . and for those who boil at `cbs butchery ' they can now own all of the gothic episodes and watch it in the order it was meant to be viewed
