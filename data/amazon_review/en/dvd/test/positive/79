left & right brain videos were big hits at our house ! i purchased these used from a bookstore that buys and resells used books and videos . i think my baby boy was about 5 months old at the time . these were the only videos that ever captured his attention at that young age . any other video -- disney , baby einstein , etc. -- just had him crying within a few minutes . these , though , he would watch to the end , fascinated . to this day , he loves them , and he is now 15 months old ; the tapes are worn out so i am reordering them both . not only does he still love them , but i just had a new baby , and i am hoping they will entertain her just as much . in fact , the other night , we accidentally woke him up and he cried and cried and would n't go back to sleep . finally , in desperation , my husband popped one of these into the vcr , and my son was instantly quieted the moment he heard the familiar music ; in no time at all he was ready to go back to bed . we have since purchased most of the other titles in the brainy baby series -- he loves them all , the music , the images of the babies , etc . the abc video is especially well-done . he also gradually learned to enjoy other types of videos by baby einstein , sesame street , etc . but these two left & right brain videos are still his very favorites .
