well i really liked it ! the movie is similar to crash . it is a comedy/drama about the subject of immigration , emigration and racial mixing among modern day czechs . the performances are expertly acted and very moving . i love the storyline of a skinhead footballer who tries to `` adopt '' a colored boy when his wife buys him and brings him home . it seems when it comes to having a son , color does n't really matter all that much , even to a committed ayran !
