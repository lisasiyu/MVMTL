beauty is skin deep if only we can all see the inner beauty in people , we will all live in a better place ! this is a cute comedy romantic movie that shows the viewer how shallow we are when it comes to physical beauty , are n't we all guilty of it . if only we can see folks for what they really are . i avoided this film for years , because of jack black , but i did catch it on tv and enjoyed the plot of the movie and eventually liked the way jack black did the role of hal . interesting pov 's and lots of funny moments in this film . 4 stars for jack blacks performance
