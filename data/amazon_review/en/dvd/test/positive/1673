a quirky classic of television comedy wow , i 'm a bit too young to remember the addams family in its original run on network television , but i love the charles addams cartoons , and have always liked john astin , so i bought this dvd set . it is just wonderful . nice clean prints of the episodes . great writing , and a wonderful ensemble cast . and there really is a subtle message in these shows about being true to yourself and being kind . the more savage-appeal of the movies is absent here-these characters are quirky , but well-meaning , and i heartily recommend this set . the commentary with steve cox , lisa loring , ken weatherwax and felix silla is also terrific and fun and gives a bit of behind-the-scenes flavor that is very welcome
