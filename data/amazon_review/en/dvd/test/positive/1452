we love it ! this is one of our favorite movies ( mine and my husband 's ) . the end is a little confusing the first time you see it , but the movie is excellent . in 2004 , i watched it three times in one weekend while writing a paper for a lit class , and still loved it on monday . the deadpan delivery of kevin spacey is perfection . when he catches his wife cheating and says `` ... you do n't get to tell me what to do -- ever again . '' he could not have said it better . kevin spacey portrays perfectly the average suburban man who is bored with his life and is at the point at which he does n't care who knows it . see this movie
