film , acting , cinematography : excellent . **i tried to make as little known about plot lines ; i will try to be as vague about this film as possible . ** night of the hunter is one of those rare films that has n't won any awards and simply got stored as a film that does n't seem to get much play on television . yet , noh passes the test of time in such formidable ways . the storyline and believability of the plot and characters remains strong , as does the top-notch cinematography . film buffs , photography students , and all those who are fans of camera work , please , do yourself a favor ; purchase this film , pop some popcorn and then pop the flick in your player , and prepare yourself to be mesmerized by 93 minutes of a film gem . the scenes get better and better as the movie rolls on , and by the time rachel cooper ( lillian gish ) makes her grand entrance towards the end of the film , you 'll probably have already grabbed your handkerchief or shirt sleeve to wipe away the tears , several times over . how can i impart to film buffs and those who enjoy `` eye candy , '' to please become an owner of this treasure ? noh is rarely spoken of when it comes to must-haves in feature movies . when you see the list of talent , it seems like a quiet film that made its debut in the 1950 's , not produced to try for blockbuster status . and people did n't recognize the film then , except perhaps that they did n't embrace its style . it 's been over half a century since , and noh is an opportunity for you to turn off your cellphone and let yourself journey with john ( billy chapin ) and pearl harper ( sally jane bruce ) as they depend on each other to survive what happens within their family . by the time miss rachel appears , you simply want to cry on her shoulders yourself . ms. gish commanded the performance , and seemed to be the only one ( along with john ) who had any real common sense to understand the unfolding situations . fortunately , most of the film seemed to take place in the night , and stanley cortez took control of his shots and of the lighting in such extraordinary ways . **slight spoiler info , very slight** one scene worth a note : look past the `` spider 's web '' and the other things during the boat ride ; put yourself in the mind of a child , and watch them from that kind of perspective , to understand and appreciate these scenes . at first , i was put off by the perspective of some things , but now , i thoroughly enjoy this passage . **end spoils** the interesting thing i observed about noh is that especially now , this kind of unfolding drama could happen in real life . nothing in it is beyond reasonable . and that 's the chilling thought that coursed through my mind after watching it again . imagine the point of first contact between john and the preacher . the style of filming is so deep-thought . i also found that cortez was a photographer , and each scene he composed shows that very foundation . after you watch noh , place it in an easy-to-get location , because you 'll want to watch it again and again . if not for the gorgeously-thought out settings , for perhaps the excellent songs contained within the film . **some more spoils , about scenes** my favorites : john 's first knowledge of harry powell when telling a story to pearl harry powell with willa harper in the bedroom willa harper 's river scene the complete dark passage on the river scene after scene is incredible . you could grab still frames from these and make a beautiful photo album . someone once wrote that it may have been easier to shoot such scenes with black and white film . well ... . look at the b/w films that have been shot through the decades . rare are films in which the cinematographer truly displays all of their inner talents . it is simply masterful .
