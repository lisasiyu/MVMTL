two sweet-azz movies these were my two favorite movies to watch on those all night parties back when i was in school , something good to have on in the background . dazed & confused -- the year is 1976 . it 's the last day of school , and it 's time for the new seniors to do some hazing on the new freshmen ! paddling the guys with those wooden boards , and making the girls look like fools . now that 's that done , we spend the rest of the movie drivin around , getting dazed and confused ; hanging out at the pool hall ; and trying to find a party to go to . fast times at ridgemont high -- the year is 1982 . sex , drugs , and rock n ' roll is the story of this movie . jeff spicoli is a surfer dude who always being harrassed by his scrict teacher : mr. hand . the teacher wo n't even let spicoli enjoy a pizza that he ordered in class ; no respect for stoners . we 've got other characters like brad hamilton who 's having a hard time finding himself in his senoir year , going from job to job - but he does find a cute girl swimming topless in a pool ( played by pheobe cates ) . his sister explores her sexual life . and of course , we have the nerd . like i said before , two awesome partying movies - like the name of the box set says
