best dvd/tv workout ! ! ! i was revisiting this page because my sister-in-law just told me there is a new dvd out ! so ... trying to find out more ! i love this workout and tell everyone about it honestly ! i do n't have extensive ballet skills at all ... unless you call 2nd grade having any ballet skills ! and this does not seem that strenuous to me at all - i almost thought it was a waste of time as me and my husband did this for the first time in 2000/2001 ( seemed too easy ) , but ... after the second time of doing this and you start to feel your muscles coming to life again and you start to hold things ( like my kids ! ) with your upper body the way you are suppose to ! it 's amazing ... the abs section for any mom trying to get back in shape is amazing ! and right along the line of what my doctor recommended , but you somehow feel more elegant doing it to classic music with the soft voice directing you ! i do n't normally love dvd/tv exercising would much rather go out for a walk , etc ... but this is so good to tone your muscles and help you feel strong ! or as the front of the dvd states `` stretches and exercises anyone can do for a strong , graceful and sculpted body '' i totally agree and seeing as my husband did this with me the first time ( and there is also a sports option to help strengthen him for skiing ! ) i do n't understand where people are saying they had a hard time following it ... maybe they could n't keep up , but ... any aerobics class , yoga class or pilates class i 've ever been to - the instructor usually say the same thing just do as much as you can and just as long as you keep moving you are getting the benefit and once you do it a couple of time you will get the hang of it ! that 's what practice is for - no one is perfect typically the first time
