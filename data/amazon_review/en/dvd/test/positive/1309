totally entertaining adventure film this is that typical kind of entertaining 1950s adventure film for all the family , of the kind `` they do n't make anymore '' . so if you liked `` elephant walk '' ( 1954 ) or `` king solomon 's mines '' ( 1950 ) , this one 's most definitely for you ! what stands out , imo , besides the special effects ( good for 1954 ) and scenes dealing the marabunta invasion , is the great chemistry between sultry , elegant , appealing eleanor parker ( joanna leiningen ) , at her prettiest and most ladylike , but at the same time , full of passion , ardour and desire to love a real man ... and there he is , charlton heston ( leiningen ) , at the peak of his macho-man magnetism with the ladies ( my mother told me that she absolutelly swooned over him around the time he made this film ) . he conveys very well the character 's contradictions between his insecurities as man and his desire for this wondrous woman ( parker ) , chosen to be his wife by his brother . the first part of the film has plenty of scenes that fully display , elegantly in 1950s style , the sexual tension between the characters played by both leads . they make one of the handsomest couples ever paired . william conrad ( of `` jake and the fatman '' fame ) is good as the friendly comissioner . abraham sofaer plays a similar role than in `` elephant walk '' , but this time more sympathetic towards the heroine . some footage must have been filmed on location , but almost all of the scenes involving the leading players were obviously filmed in paramount 's backlot . good entertainment ! the dvd has no extras though . the print 's quality is very good !
