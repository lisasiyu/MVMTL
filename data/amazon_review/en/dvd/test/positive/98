`` try this for a deep , dark secret ... '' yes , i was a kid growing up in the '80s and one of my favorite shows was the charming remington steele , which i actually preferred to moonlighting . pierce brosnan was so cool and debonair and so dang british that i wanted to be like him . the fact that he was a con-man and had a mysterious past added to the mystique . and lord , i had such a crush on laura holt , who was beautiful , clever , earnest , athletic and kinda prudish ( turns out , our little miss prim & proper had a few urges she firmly kept in check ) . anyways , i 'm a sucker for freckles . one of the best things about season one was the ultra-cool theme song by the great henry mancini . the music exuded sheer class and sexiness and seemed to promise champagne and skullduggery . another cool thing was the intro voice-over of stephanie zimbalist : `` try this for a deep , dark secret . the great detective remington steele ? he does n't exist . i invented him . follow ... '' and so , we do . skip this paragraph if you know the show 's premise . laura holt is a very capable sleuth whose private investigative agency is n't drawing in the clients , mostly because she 's a woman . so she invents a front man - a decidedly masculine superior - named remington steele ( according to laura , `` remington '' is derived from a brand of typewriter , while `` steele '' is from the pittsburg steelers ) . soon , sure enough , clients are coming in droves . and then , one day , he walked in . episode one , license to steele , tells of the chance encounter between laura holt and a charming , urbane thief who steals her heart and , while he 's at it , the name and identity of her agency . the show remington steele ushered in a short era of sophistication and sly humor that recalled the best of vintage hollywood . brosnan and zimbalist may not have gotten along well in real life , but as steele and holt , they were a match made in heaven . the show was ably supported by the yearning murphy ( james read ) , who never did get over his suspicions ( not totally unfounded ) about steele , and the gum-chewing bernice fox ( janet demay ) , whose name remington chose to not clearly remember , much to her annoyance . too bad the powers-that-be decided murphy and bernice were in the way of remington and laura 's blossoming romance ; they were written out by season two . the mysteries themselves were n't all that original , more than a few being patterned after the plots of famous movies , which ties in nicely with remington 's penchant for quoting from hollywood 's golden age . but viewers did n't tune in for the quality of the mystery elements ( do n't get me wrong , they did n't suck ) , but rather - much like the classic thin man films - for the nova-intense chemistry between the two leads and their up-and-down romantic relationship . it would take a few seasons before their always-on-the-verge-but-never-quite-consumated flirtation became frustrating for the audience . this season is the first and by far the best . highlight episodes of season one are : license to steele ( episode 1 ) - private eye laura holt is hired to protect some valuable , high profile jewelry , but an enigmatic ( but very suave ) british scam artist keeps popping up . serious eye contact and innuendos are exchanged between the two , which later results in the con-man ( who has his own problems ) taking up the identity of the fictitious remington steele . needless to say , a must see episode . thou shalt not steele ( episode 5 ) - a woman ( cassandra harris , brosnan 's real wife at the time ) from steele 's mysterious past convinces steele to steal a painting rumored to be cursed from a los angeles museum exhibit . problem is , laura had already contracted to protect the valuable painting . fun episode with remington and laura dabbling in professional thieving . this is the debut of felicia , remington 's ex-flame , who shows up again in season 4 . in the steele of the night ( episode 9 ) - laura and murphy attend a reunion party consisting of sleuths who used to work for the havenhurst agency . one of the detectives is killed and remington ( who crashes the get-together ) is elected to solve the murder . very amusing , as laura handfeeds clues to remington , who attempts to look knowledgeable in front of his `` peers . '' steele trap ( episode 10 ) - this one channels agatha christie 's classic and then there were none . remington and laura show up at a weekend bash on the private island of a smut magazine publisher . and then people start getting killed off one by one . vintage steele ( episode 19 ) - shenanigans in a winery and a recurring corpse . laura stripteases and the two finally kiss . this is a cool episode and one of the most romantic . we finally find out stuff about laura 's past , specifically the reason why laura does n't like to mix business with pleasure . steele 's gold ( episode 20 ) - remington , laura , and murphy follow a prospector 's journal , hoping to unearth gold . hijinks in a ghost town and a wild treasure hunt in the desert . fun episode . sting of steele ( episode 21 ) - the first sighting of daniel chalmers ( efrem zimbalist jr. - stephanie 's dad ) , remington 's mentor and surrogate dad , who shows up needing steele 's assistance in putting on an intricate sting to shake some villains off his back . another vintage episode . this box set contains four discs with all 22 episodes . special features contain three episode commentaries ( license to steele , tempered steele , and vintage steele ) , as well as several making-of featurettes and character bios . give this show a chance and see why it launched pierce brosnan to hollywood 's stratosphere .
