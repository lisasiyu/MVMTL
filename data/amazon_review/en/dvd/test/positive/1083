a hard lesson the thing that we in our time fail at is to disapprove of someone for the right reasons . the true historical significance of hitler and the nazis is not well known . an earlier reviewer ntioned that germany was in a wretched state economically and morally when the nazis started to vie for power . this can not be denied . nor can it be denied that hitler repaired germany 's economy and in an astonishingly short period of time brought germany to the forefront of world power . what is not understood is the true threat that hitler posed . the 25 points of the national aryan socialist party were a list of goals that they wished to achieve . number 11 clearly stated that they wished to eliminate interest banking ; and felt that it was crippling europe 's economy . of course they blamed the jews : but this broad-stroke was clearly one of hitler 's failures . what is significant is that once hitler declared this ; the international banking cartels realized that he was a threat to them . any nation who seeks economic autonomy can not be tolerated . in fact , almost all the wars that have been fought in the last two and a half centuries were merely busines deals gone sour . hitler never wanted war with england . it was in churchil 's interests to instigate war , owing to his being a puppet for the international financial elite . having said that , there is the quality of the nation-state , and its upliftment wherein hitler was a pioneer and trailblazer . he was the first to use the technological method to achieve his aims . he wa sthe first human being to appear on a public tv broadcast , he used radio and tv and in this case , cinema , to great effect . the holocaust was distinctive only in that it was the worlds first application of technological method towards genocide ( unfortunately , not the last ) . watching his speech in this movie was a lesson in the manipulation of public opinion : and in human psychology . there was , within hitler and his methods , a cynicism concerning the general state of the people . consider the following quotes : `` i reserve reason for the few , and emotion for the many '' `` if i approached my audiences with reasoned arguments , they would n't understand me . their intelligence is small . i must reduce my philosophies to four or five very simple points which i repeat over and over again , until my words become like commands under hypnosis '' this is the general opinion he had of the majority of people . and if you examine any modern politician 's speeches , they use the exact same methods of addressing their audiences . ms. reinfenstahl 's brilliant cinematography upheld this in an eloquent manner . hitler wrote the book on how to effectively set up and maintain a technological tyranny ; and his techniques have proven effective - especially when his obvious mistakes are avoided . he was just too obvious . too much ego . to little hypocracy . we ca n't say we were n't warned
