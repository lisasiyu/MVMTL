surrealistically bizzare though this was not the first modern horror film to use parody ( dawn of the dead , an american werewolf in london are examples ) , the lengths to which is goes are wildly imaginative . just like re-animator spoofed the sci-fi/horror genre , evil dead 2 takes on the slasher film genre and sends it up way before the scream/i know what you did last summer/scary movie cash cows . for those who liked the `` tree '' sequence in the first evil dead movie , imagine it being magnified over and over again . using the stop motion animation technique in a deliberately crude fashion , evil dead 2 is still wildly imaginative . a person tries to fight off their own severed hand . visions appear from nowhere . the first sequence in speeded up time is dizzily unnerving . if you do n't like slasher films ( believe me this is a hell of a lot better than any friday the 13th film , take your pick ) or if you 're one of those old blue haired types ranting about `` video nasties '' then stay away . however , if you want a good , gorey and even sometimes scary descent into madness then evil dead 2 is for you . for real film fanatics , one might note ( though on a far more intellectual level ) the sense of the world collapsing and turning against the protagonist ( s ) of the film can also be found ( albeit much more arty and far less gorey ) in the films of jan svankmeyer . as for the casual horror buff , evil dead ii is a classic of the subgenre of splatter films with a sense of humor which would be taken to new heights with rob zombie 's `` the devil 's rejects '' . leave the lights on
