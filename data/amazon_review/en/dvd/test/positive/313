enthusiastic if not gay the professional reviewer missed the main point of jeffrey 's dilemma . he 's not so afraid of getting aids ; he 's afraid of falling in love with a man who then dies of it . most people figure a 50 % chance of dying before their spouse ; but taking on a person with a known , fatal disease throws those odds way out of kilter and creates a desperate , poignant situation . steve weber is no gayer than george bush but he certainly is an enthusiastic kisser . this was the first film i saw michael weiss in and he totally had me convinced he was gay . i knew patrick stewart is n't , but his performance is dead on . overall , a very funny movie with a big , big heart
