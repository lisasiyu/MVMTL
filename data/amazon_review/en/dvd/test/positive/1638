great fun good heavens , where do they get these 'essential ' amazon reviews anyway ? sheesh . nothing like a good dose of pomposity to motivate a reply . this movie is n't supposed to be taken remotely seriously , please . it 's a goof -- and a very skillful one . sure , the plot 's a mismash of twice-reheated devices , the baddies are about as subtle as week-old meat , and to watch at all requires you suspend enough disbelief to reconsider the easter bunny as gospel . so what ? you do n't go to movies like lethal weapon for the depth of characterization . yes , a bit helps , but ... not too much . same holds true here . it 's easy to ridicule -- but it 's easier to enjoy . movies like long kiss goodnight are made or broken by virtue of their scriptwriting , and the script for lkg can more than hold its head up alongside other genre staples . a good script determines how willing an audience is not only to watch a movie -- but rewatch it . ( and buy it , for that matter . ) long kiss goodnight offeres a lot of pleasure in this department , it 's got more quoteable lines than die hard and -- yeah , let 's be frank : the lead 's hotter . ( a perhaps more up-to-date comparison for tone would be speed . ) the crux of the arguments over the film 's virtues , however , is & i suspect will remain whether you buy -- or want to buy into -- the idea of doing this kind of film as a girl-thing in the first place . ( like anyone questions the validity of the premises behind james bond movies ? come on . this is really very simple : if you enjoy films where women kick @ ** , you 'll very likely enjoy this . if the mere idea makes your lips purse with disapproval , skip it & move on . ) not to mention -- what better place to subvert expectations than at the movies ? though the script may be better than usual , what really sells the film is davis & jackson -- they have killer chemistry . their scenes are filled with some terrific lines , but more than that , it 's about delivery ; they parry quips and insults with a good-natured banter that goes beyond making even the implausible character of samantha almost believable : it 's just plain fun watching two actors at the top of their game play off each other . no reason to turn up one 's nose at a-grade actors in b-grade movies ; i seem to recall some truckers-in-space thing years ago ... alien , was it ? the movie loses a bit of momentum towards the end when it makes a feeble pass at message , but that 's easy to shrug off -- the editing 's otherwise tight and the pace is just what it should be , fast with breathing spots . the special effects work . because the film 's pretty retro in terms of plot & setting it generally has n't dated much , and the buddy-twist here is a much-needed change from the usual guyfests . last , the soundtrack is excellent , i 'm always amazed when a wise choice can bring something like she 's not there back from the dead . the only shame is that the album soundtrack lacks a lot of the best selections from the film , which demonstrates much taste in southern blues . finally : ok , yes . that thing with the shot glass ? too cool
