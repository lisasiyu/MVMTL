fun , fast and challenging ( if all done together ) : - > this is a great workout as a whole ( or more than one segment at least ) . michelle dozois ( shape dvd 's ) is energetic and enthusiastic without going overboard . she is motivating and cues very well . the five segments are slow and steady burn , carb killer , power blast , interval burn and metabolism booster . the thing i like about this is that you can customise your own workout or do them in order . there 's great music to also keep you motivated and give you a good workout routine . the only problem is that you really should do a minimum of two workouts in a row or you wo n't get as much benefit as possible . one segment is fine on it 's own if you are topping up from another routine you do . but overall , i think everyone will like this because it 's great if you are short on time and because you can mix it up , it does n't get boring . i love it
