loved the movie . the dvd , not so much the 13th century , europe . russia ( at this time known as `` rus '' ) is at her weakest , with mongolian hordes overrunning her lands to the east . what remains of russia seems ready to fall as the germanic order of the teutonic knights - under the blessings of the catholic church - march on to take the land for rome . thus this is the setting for `` alexander nevksy , '' probably one of the earliest `` great hero versus the evil horde '' type of movies ever made . it is very clear who you 're supposed to love and who you 're supposed to hate in this movie . the russian characters are a grand assortment of loveable characters that are well developed in their own right . on one hand you have vasily and gavrilo , two friends vying for the affection of a young girl who enter a pact that whoever proves bravest in battle will win her hand . you also have have ignat , the friendly armorer who seems to find a bird metaphor for every situation . ( and was personally my favorite character ) on the other hand , the teutonic knights are portrayed as absolute devils . they are a deeply militarized enemy , wearing masks that turn them into a lifeless , faceless enemy . the grand master plans to divide rus among his knights , orders the death of russian pow 's , and in one scene tosses babies into a bonfire . ( although in eisenstein 's defense , this was n't his creation - that was what the teutonic knights supposedly did ) likewise , the russian who betrays the city of pskov to the germans is hated by alexander even more than the grand master is . a lot has been discussed about the propaganda nature of the film . obviously at the time there was tension between the soviet union and nazi germany , and this surely inspired eisenstein in his work . the villifying of the germans as well as the subtle symbolism - the swastika-like shape on the bishop 's hat and the hands hand sticking out of teutonic helmets as if in a sieg heil - can only support this . the film 's soundtrack is peppered with patriotic russian songs calling for the people to rise up against the enemy , defend russian land , and the usual calls to arms . i do not feel , however , that this detracts at all from the film . eisenstein was always an artist first and a politician last . the character of alexander nevksy is portrayed as dashing , compassionate , brave , and a man-of-the-people because that was how russian legend portrayed him , and that was how he was emoted through the actor nikolai cherkassov . a lot of people have said he is a metaphor for stalin , but at no point in the film did i think , `` wow , this nevsky is a lot like stalin . '' nevsky is no more like stalin than were king david of the bible , aragorn in `` lord of the rings , '' or davy crockett of the alamo 's legend . some of the more negative reviewers have wondered how stalin signed the pact with germany after this film was released - the truth is , the film was n't released for too long . the soviet government approved it 's making , then removed it from theaters after the non-aggression pact was signed with germany . eisenstein was heartbroken because , as stated before , he was always an artist before a politician . it should be noted especially that for a time before this film as made he could not get support in russia because the communists disapproved of his putting film method over party ideals . and eisenstein 's touch for filmmaking certainly shines through here , as the man who brought us the famous odessa steps sequence in `` the battleship potemkin '' brings us the the battle on the ice sequence . the close shots of hand-to-hand combat are stunning for the time they were filmed . ( even if by today 's standards it looks like a bunch of guys clanking their shields together ) from nevsky 's cavalry charge to the teutonic shield wall to the crumbling of the ice , you 'll find yourself rooting for the russians at least once or twice . ( i especially laughed at the part where gavrilo grabs a german , spits in his face , and axes him out ) regrettably , the dvd is not too good . there 's not even a title menu - when you put the dvd in it goes straight to the movie , and when it 's done it goes to the chapter selection . there 's no commentary , no original trailer , no cast bios - nothing ! this combined with an unrestored audio track and sloppily placed subtitles almost hurts the movie-watching experience . considering this film is put alongside `` battleship potemkin '' and `` ivan the terrible '' as eisenstein 's greatest films , i think it deserves something better . maybe in the future criterion will do what they did for akira kurosawa 's `` ran '' and finally give the film a decent dvd release . wait ... technically they did , but it 's in an $ 80 dvd compilation with `` ivan the terrible . '' i suppose if you 're willing to bring out the extra bucks , you can be happy at last . all in all , i was not disappointed with this film . if you liked `` the battleship potemkin , '' like russian cinema , or you want to see a good foreign film , ( or you want to see what the russians had before `` lotr : the two towers '' was made ) this i definitely recommend this movie
