came because of sela ward . stayed because it was a phenomenal show there are very few shows in my lifetime that i have been fiercely loyal to , but the now defunct `once and again ' without question , topped that short list . i will admit that my lifelong crush on actress sela ward was my main interest in this series , originally . single , with no kids , and in my late 20s during o & a 's debut , i was far out of abc 's target demographic for this show . i did n't expect to like the show very much , but i got sucked in not because of sela , but because the show was nothing less than fantastic . superbly acted and superbly written , abc never gave this show a chance to find its audience , and it bounced around from time slot to time slot until it 's all too early demise . even the best shows need to be pitched correctly to viewing audiences to have a chance . the premise of the story is of rick samler and lily manning , two fortysomething single parents who re-enter the adult dating scene after their divorces . they fall head over heels for one another , and find that life and love in the ( then ) late 1990s is far different than what they remember . adding children , careers , parents , and ex-spouses to the mix just adds different layers of complications and challenges for rick and lily . most shows `jump the shark ' at some point during their lifetimes . while some could argue that the hostage episode in s2 was that point for o & a , i disagree . once and again always presented two kinds of television : good , and better . the stories and characters could fill you with hope , heartbreak , or both every week almost without fail . and best of all - everything about this show was real . very little , if any , suspension of disbelief was required . perhaps the best thing i can say about o & a is that it is the only show that i was so passionate about saving , that i sat down and wrote a letter to abc , asking them to reconsider their canceling of it ( as part of an organized campaign with other fans ) . while the campaign was n't successful , the release ( finally ) of the series on dvd will allow those who loved this show then to enjoy it forever , as well as allow those who did n't get to view o & a during its run to discover it , and they too , might find out why we who followed this show from the beginning understood that this was just a beautiful story
