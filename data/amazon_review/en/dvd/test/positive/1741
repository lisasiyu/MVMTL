shanghai in the 1930s : love , and fate collide this film is deeply intense . there is often silence that is thick with meaning . the camera often tells much of the story , honing in on the actors and actresses faces ... the spartan rooms ... the city scapes/ scenes ... the commotion of workers going to and from work ... the riots , protests and rebellions ... the crowds of people at the railroad station in shanghai . the film begins in shanghi in 1928 where cynthia ( zhang ziyi ) a chinese young lady has a love affair with itami ( toru nakamura ) a japanese young man whose father is part of a japanese delegation who lived in shanghai , seeking political opportunity to destabilize the region . times are tense , the atmosphere is ripe for political change and explosive events ... itami is called back to japan to serve in the military and their brief but very passionate love affair is cut short . the film is impressionistic and surreal in how it portrays events and relationships . there are clandestine organizations at work , and it is not often clear who is involved in what until some complicated twist and turn in the plot occurs to reveal the truth . early in the film , cynthia 's brother is ambushed by a japanese underground group . he is murdered before her eyes . this causes her to join the `` deep purple '' a clandestine chinese revolutionary group who try to bring about justice for china and eliminate the japanese threat . zhang ziyi does an outstanding performance in this serious role . after witnessing her brother 's murder , she takes on a false identity , hui deng , a nurse who works at marion hospital . hers is a stellar performance along with itami played by toru nakamura . hui deng participates in an assassination at the railroad station where szeto , a chinese agent of deep purple , loses his lady love , accidentally killed in the crossfire . he is also given a briefcase by mistake which puts him in the middle of some very serious problems . szeto becomes heavily embroiled in the activities of deep purple against the japanese but he falls into a trap which puts his life at risk . he is in a very precarious position . he makes a deal , it saves his life but ulitimately because of the direction he went ... he ends up losing it . itami returns to shanghai to take over as the leader of the japanese movement . he is replacing mr. yoshikawa who is being recalled to japan . itami is managing the upheaval and creating more dissension and rioting , through his spy network and underground operations . the japanese want to control shanghai . cynthia again enters itami 's life and becomes personally involved renewing their love affair but with ulterior motives . however , itami is not who he used to be and neither is cynthia the same person she was . unknown to itami , she is now an assassin and revolutionary . itami asks cynthia to return to tokyo with him , he even arranges for legal authorization with his boss . itami and cynthia attend a party at the japanese club , where they dance to a very haunting and beautiful chinese tune , called `` a garden bridge '' . the events which transpire at the party are jaw-dropping . the twists and turns of the plot are unpredictable and very satisfying . the ending will astonish the viewer ... at the very end of the film , there is actual black and white film footage of the japanese invasion of shanghai around 1932 which brings *full* closure on the film . this is a most astonishing complex story with exceptionally artistic cinematography and great acting . erika borsos [ pepper flower ]
