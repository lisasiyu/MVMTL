ridley + stone + penn = serious rock 'n roll . u turn ( oliver stone , 1997 ) i 'm a big fan of stray dogs , the john ridley novel upon which u-turn is based , and i avoided the film for while because , really , how many film adaptations of your best-loved novels actually work the way you want them to ? i should n't have worried , though ; u-turn is the stuff , most decidedly . the plot : bobby cooper , an on-the-run tennis pro ( sean penn ) has his car conk out on him just shy of a very , very weird little desert town . one of its residents , grace mckenna ( jennifer lopez ) , immediately catches his eye , but he soon finds out she 's married to a nasty old character named jake ( nick nolte ) , who 'd just as soon see her dead -- and offers bobby fifty grand to do the deed . immediately , a complex web of deceit unfurls among all the characters , complicated by a number of even stranger events happening at just the wrong time to make bobby 's life miserable . the main thing that sticks out about this movie is the caliber of its cast , and the caliber of the performances they give . when you have to stick jon voight and billy bob thornton seventh and eighth in credits order , you 've got a high-powered cast working for you . all of them are spot on . the plot moves forward at almost blinding speed ( just as it did in the book ; ridley adapted his own novel ) , and the viewer has very little time to do anything but clench his teeth and hang on for the ride until the final credits roll . it 's just plain fun . i 'm not sure why i stopped watching oliver stone flicks in the late eighties ( okay , yeah i am -- born on the fourth of july , the doors , and jfk back to back got a little heavy in to the world of way-out conspiracy theory for me ) , but i 'm glad i 've started again . *** Â½
