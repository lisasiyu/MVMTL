strikingly beautiful story and film i had n't heard anything about this movie when i bought it , but the cover caught my eye . i ended up with one of my favorite movies ever . this film is very much a coming of age film about a young boy going through rough times and dealing with the guilt of a tragic mistake . this film pulls at the heartstrings and appeals to the eyes . for lovers of art house films , this is a must have . often times hazy , often times gritty , and always beautiful , this film will not disappoint .
