jeanne crain is pinky ! while i would have preferred dorothy dandridge or lena horne to have payed the titled lead in this interracial romance , produced any released by fox in 1949 , jeanne crain does an excellent job of portraying `` pinky '' johnson , a mississippi `` colored '' girl , who up north ( boston ) `` passes '' for white and falls in love with white doctor william lundigan , who does a fine job , in a not realized role.3 ethel waters as pinkys ' granmother and ethel barrymore as a family friend do excellent work as do frederick o ' neal , nina mae mckinney , in smaller , but important roles.3 elia kazen , not one of my favorites , for a number of reasons , directed after john ford was taken ill ( actually fired ? ) and had to leave the production , kazen did not care for jeannes ' performance.dudley nichols ( fired because he would not change his downbeat ending ) and phillip dunne ( how green was my valley ) wrote the screenplay . i do n't like to use the term `` colored '' , but thats ' how pinky is repeattedly referred to in the film.maybe 4 and 1/2 stars is a better rating , also jeanne and both ethels received aa nominations
