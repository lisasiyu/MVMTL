superior concert video this is by far the best concert video i own . the stones were on top of their game at this st. louis concert , soulful , bluesy , and rocking . the cameras stay on the band the whole time , unlike many current concert videos that seem to think the viewer wants to watch the audience . the sound is cd quality , the picture and color is vivid , the editing is tight . the highlight for me is keith richards ' `` i wan na hold you '' and some incredible versions of many classics . the songs from the bridges to babylon album are excellent and it is funny how quickly some of them faded from the permanent repertoire . the fact of the matter is the stones have enough excellent songs to do ten different concerts . i highly recommend this dvd . it is superior to the four flicks , and a lot less expensive . five stars
