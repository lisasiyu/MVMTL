excellent learning tool wow , what an excellent dvd ! since the first time we put it on for our 20 months old daughter , she has been hooked to it . this is an excellent dvd for kids starting from 6 months . lots and lots of color and classical music keep the kid busy constantly . the combination of colors , objects and music greatly enhances their ability to think and relate to everyday things . i highly recommend this to all parents . my wife found out about this while searching for baby einstein dvd .
