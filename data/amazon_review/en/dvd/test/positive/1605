a very enjoyable performance of a lesser known opera although there are no show stopping arias that the viewer will remember , the music is very pleasant and full of melody , and the performance is excellent . if you are looking to broaden your collection to include more than the standard operas such as boheme , aida , etc , this light comedy is a very good choice . not only do the singers sing and act their parts well , but they also look their parts ( which is frequently not the case in opera )
