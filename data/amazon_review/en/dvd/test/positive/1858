i agree with all the comments i have seen this movie in french few years ago and i have always considered that it was a good movie about india of the years 1850-1900 . radjah , princesses , officers , soldiers , merchants , costumes , music , elephant , cobra , british pride , long sandy roads , battles , etc . it is a long saga . some time too slow but it is a good one
