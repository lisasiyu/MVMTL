a beautiful glimpse this dvd is a beautiful glimpse into the world , and work , of john santerineross , known as the leader in this genre , of art photography , he treats us to all the photographs in both of his books , `` fruit of the secret god '' , and `` dream '' , he includes a montage of film clips taken while he composes his pieces , and a short art film about a shocking subject ( cutting ) , done very tenderly , so as not to shock . this little film , in spite of breath taking visuals , is not so much eye candy , as it is mind candy , leaving a hauntingly , bittersweet , after taste on the tongue . the images are living assembelages of religio-sensual elements , presented through a dream like filter . the sepia tone photography , evokes the feeling of , a memory , a strange familiarity , regarding our desires and fears . his work is a wild roller coaster ride , which , thrills , and at times , terrifies , and leaves you wanting to `` go again '' . the images of women portrayed in this work , are a refreshing respite from the mainstream images of women that , we are bombarded with daily in the media . like real women , each image begs to be studied for content . the film itself is not long but is filled with so much information , so much to process , it is an epic in its own right . i highly recommend any of john santerineross 's work , to lovers of neo- symbolist , art , photography , and erotica . to other artists like myself he is truly an inspiration .
