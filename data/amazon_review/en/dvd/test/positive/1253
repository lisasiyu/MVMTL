a little cheesy , but an all time classic considering that this movie came out in 1951 , the special effects are n't too bad . the acting is alright , and anyone that understands astronomy would understand many things in this movie just are n't possible . putting that aside , its just a neat old movie , that i had to add to the dvd collection
