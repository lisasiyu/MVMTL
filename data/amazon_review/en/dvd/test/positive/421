a worthy addition to your fitness collection this dvd will get you sweating in a hurry . i really like the interval training in the fat eliminator segment . alternating strength and cardio segments does make the workout go by quickly , which is a plus for this reluctant exerciser ! minna is excellent at cueing and i like her demeanor . the only thing i really do n't like about it ( and why it is not a 5-star video for me ) is all of the jumping . it is definitely not low-impact . if you have knee problems , find another video !
