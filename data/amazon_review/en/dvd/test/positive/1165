'bowled over , big time ! another nfl season gone , another round of nfl playoffs comin ' up ( as of this writing ) . this is the time i usually look back on those great super bowl teams of yore by whippin ' out those half-hour super bowl highlight shows i taped offa espn2 several years back . that is , until nfl films finally saw the light and put the first thirty together in separate dvd box sets , now combined into this super-set . now i can watch my fave super bowl shows ( aka the 49er and redskins victories , and the ones the cowboys , rams , & raiders lost ) do n't have to worry about my gradually deteriorating vhs tapes getting eaten by my vcr ! while i thought the recap shows alone were worth the bucks i threw down , nfl films added even more value to the presentation by throwing two featurettes in with each super bowl game . included among the mini-shows in games i to x are brief profiles of the careers of bart starr , terry bradshaw , bob lilly , jack lambert , and roger staubach . also showcased : the silent enigma that was cowboys rb duane thomas , the dolphins ' undefeated 1972 season and their famed ( ? ) `` no-name '' defense of the early 70s , the legacy of tom landry , the fights that broke out between cbs and nbc before , during , and after their simultaneous broadcast of game i , the minnesota vikings setting the standard for super bowl futility , and other sideline stuff i never knew about before . then there 's the second decalogue of highlights from `` the great american time-out '' , featuring both good moments ( the 49ers ' first two wins in xvi & xix ; the `skins ' first super bowl championship in game xvii , and the bears ' 46 defense stealing the show in game xx ) and not-so-great ones ( the raiders claiming games xi , xv , and xviii , and the cowboys picking up their second lombardi trophy after xii ) . while i found most of the featurettes in the xi to xx run kinda interesting , i was also driven to nausea by the sappiness of a few of `em . runnin ' the saccharine-o-meter to the red zone was the piece on anthony munoz and his nfl prospect son , howie long discussing his life in football and how he 's been keepin ' himself busy after his retirement , and jim plunkett pulling himself off of the nfl scrap heap to lead the raiders to two super bowl championships . i swear , if i hear one more interview where someone was talking about how much heart ol ' what's-his-face had , or how so-and-so 's toughness & drive really inspired the rest of the team , i 'm gon na need insulin treatments ! finally , there 's the third decalogue of shows , featuring the good ( the 49ers ' last three championships & the `skins ' last two ) , the bad ( the giants escaping game xxv with the win , and the cowboys grabbin ' three lombardis in four seasons in games xxvii , xxviii , and xxx ) , and the downright ugly ( the broncos and bills match the vikings ' record for super bowl haplessness ) . sadly , most of the contests recapped here were more like `` stupor bowls '' ( see my listmania on this coma-inducing phenomenon at www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-/poloadg90jft/ref=cm_aya_av.lm_more/102-8646183-3962510 ) , featuring the bulk of the nfc 's 13 year dominance of the big dance , including the only two super bowls where the winning team scored 50 points or more ( xxiv and xxvii ) . a couple games were close at halftime ( xxi & xxviii ) , but the nfc champions eventually managed to pull well away from their less-than-capable afc opponents in the second half . fortunately , there was a halfway decent super bowl ( xxx ) along with two of the greatest ever played ( xxiii featuring joe montana 's legendary drive , and buffalo kicker scott norwood 's `` miss heard `round the world '' in xxv ) to help keep the boredom from setting in too deeply . adding a touch of excitement to both the `` blah '' games and the smattering of close ones is the wonderful background music , which is some of the most exciting soundtrack tunage i 've ever laid my ears on . btw i 'm glad to see nfl films has seen the light and finally put a whole buncha these tracks out on cd ( check it out at www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0002verqa/ref=cm_aya_wlasin.title/102-8646183-3962510 ? v=glance & coliid=i49vmcs3cobjx & colid=35srbz4zq8hu3 ) ... unfortunately , there were a couple things that i noticed were amiss : the supe xxi and xxiii shows have been edited down a bit . i recall the xxi show being titled `` land of the giants '' during the `` opening credits '' sequence when i caught it on espn2 , but when i saw it on dvd here , the `` land of the giants '' title had been deleted . more heavily edited was the opening title ( `` drive to greatness '' ) & credits sequence to the game xxiii show , which was completely excised . the featurettes in this set usually cover the players who coached or participated in each game ( doug williams as the super bowl 's first black quarterback in xxii , steve young in xxix , etc . ) or breaks down the most memorable moment in that game ( like the niners ' game-winning drive in xxiii , norwood 's miss in xxv , leon lett-ing a td get away in xxvii , etc. ) . like the previous sideshows , the xxi-to-xxx mini-films were a bit sappy ... now i 'm wondering if nfl films will wait until after game xl is played before they put out the final box set -- well , `` final '' `til games xli to l have been played , anyway -- or will they do it shortly after xxxix , and leave the set one super bowl short of a full ten ? personally , i 'm hoping they go for the former option ; i 'm patient enough that i could stand to wait an extra year to get a complete ten-game set . but even if they do n't wait , set four will likely be the most exciting of the bunch , featuring the best bits of xxxii ( john elway & the broncos finally winning it all ) , xxxiv ( the titans end up a yard short of tying the game as time runs out ) , and xxvi & xxviii ( the pats ' adam vinatieri becomes the first kicker to win two super bowls with field goals in the closing moments ) . in any case , i can hardly freakin ' wait ... `lat
