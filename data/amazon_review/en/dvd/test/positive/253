the book of acts made interesting and understandable ! first , i agree with other reviewers here that the portrayal of paul the apostle by anthony hopkins is a standout performance worthy of an emmy nomination . robert foxworth 's peter is also interestingly done but our information is lacking about his ministry when he disappears after chapter 7 in the book of acts . therefore the movie focuses on paul 's attempt to unite jew , greek and roman in a trinity of new christian faith and this film delivers on that concept , even though it is somewhat romanticized . some very effective scenes remind you of `` jesus of nazareth '' . one suprise is when paul is being confronted by his `` thorn in the flesh '' while consulting with barnabas and mark , you hear a mysterious sound that is tough to catch but mark inquires what it is to which paul replies `` just an animal '' . ( actually it is a devil ) . also there is a great confrontation with the woman who throws her voice into statues and animals to ridicule paul 's ministry . when paul tells her that she wo n't have the power to do that again it is effective enough to put a fear of the lord into you ! we get to see the journeys of paul and barnabas ( you will notice a gradual decline in the richness of barnabas shown in his clothing ) , we meet luke , timothy , silas , mark and get a basic grip on what the spread of christianity was all about in the ancient world . nero 's fay behavior will get on your nerves especially when he is engaged in conversations about paul with his jailer . paul 's triumphant entry as a prisoner into rome will remind you of jesus and his entry into jerusalem so much so that it can bring a tear to your eye . the original scene of paul forgiving the axeman when he is beheaded has been removed for some reason on this dvd . well recommended to anyone who wants some insight into the early development of the church and to understand persecution of the apostles !
