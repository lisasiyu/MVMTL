wonderful nostalgia trip i originally saw this movie when i was 10 years old and over the years remembered the wonderful dancing and songs . i was disappointed that it never seemed to turn up on tv and was delighted to be able to buy my own copy . when i saw it again recently it was even better than i had remembered it . donald o'connor 's partnership with vera-ellen is enchanting - i 've watched their dances over and over . and ethel merman lights up the screen every time she is on - her interpretation of the memorable berlin songs , whether belted out or sweetly romantic - is , i believe , unbeatable . i now want to get all the other merman movies . and what a shame that george sanders ' deep , rich baritone was n't more widely heard .
