a diamond from the diamond i was a big fan of major league , but was somewhat disappointed in major league ii , and as a result did n't buy major league iii for more than a year . i 'm sorry about that , because it turned out to be as good as or better than any in terms of its story and execution , and casting . in the first major league , we got a first class baseball story of unlikely heroes , which held up well even though i thought the personal lives of some of the players was stressed a little too much . in major league ii , which is still entertaining , i think the chemistry suffered because of this and other continuity issues . for instance , wesley snipes , the base stealing pheenom , was replaced by another actor , yet we are supposed to believe he 's the same person . does n't quite work . also , the love interest focus switched from tom berenger to charlie sheen , and we are supposed to know all about ( and root for ) a former girlfriend we have never seen before , and whose existence was n't even hinted at in the first film . and finally , the chemistry suffered a little more because the feud between the owner and the players was reintroduced in an unlikely way ( why would she buy the team back if she wanted to get out of cleveland so bad in the first film ? ) . still the second film was enjoyable and worth having , even with these issues . so , i expected a lower budget , poorer result with major league iii , and boy , i was wrong . new characters and a new situations develop , and it all seems appropriate and fresh and the acting is top notch ; the cast plays like a team and the script moves forward like a well-oiled machine . the music and photography are excellent and the action is in general spontaneous and very fun ( like when the villan manager of the twins hits himself in the head with a richocheting baseball ) . all the new characters carry off their roles extremely well , and all in all i think you should not skip this one if you like the series at all .
