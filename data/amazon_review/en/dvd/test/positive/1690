`` that 's what i 'm talking about -- surviving . '' i had heard phrases like `` stepford wife , '' `` stepford wife-ish , '' and so forth over the years . after seeing this movie , i can see what people were talking about . this 1975 chiller features katherine ross as joanna eberhart , a new york city wife , mother , and budding photographer who moves with her husband and kids to stepford , a beautiful , seemingly perfect suburb . i say `` seemingly perfect '' because while stepford is beautiful , there 's something peculiar going on , particularly with the women . they are beautiful , polite , soft-spoken , and seem to live only for being betty crockers . it does n't take long for joanna and her new friend , spirited , strong-minded bobbi markowe ( paula prentiss ) , to notice that something is a little off about these women . as it turns out , something is a little off -- they 're not human , they 're robots . that is , robots who live only to cook , clean , and please their husbands 24/7 . were they always like this ? no . once upon a time , they were actually human beings , with minds , personalities , opinions , feelings , and talents all their own . so what happened ? it seems they they 've been turned into robots by husbands who decided that they needed quiet , smiling , and submissive wives who would do whatever -- and i do mean whatever , including have sex -- they were told to do . joanna and bobby -- and a third woman named charmaine ( tina louise ) -- are the only women who still have a sense of themselves . but not for long , for soon thereafter , charmaine becomes one of them , and eventually , even bobbi , and sadly , joanna , become stepford wives , too . some of the reviewers have said that the ending -- where the wives are seen strolling through supermarket aisles in their dresses and hats -- was shocking . i did n't see it that way . to me , the ending was more sad than shocking -- sad in that joanna and the other wives were no longer themselves , no longer possessed the qualities that made them who they were . during the movie , joanna talks to her husband about surviving -- that is , surviving to stay true to herself even when the other women around her have literally become clones . when joanna is turned into one of them , she has been killed -- in more ways than one . that 's what happened to the stepford wives -- in the end , none of them survived
