good film - for some people straight to the point . . . .there are a lot of mixed reviews here , but i would say that this movie is a really good film . now , i 'm in to the quirky , eye-catching , think you ca n't stomach what is going on with this film kinda movies that have young up and coming actors/actresses in it . bijou philips can always be spotted in most of the films , that 's how you know it might fit the mold . anyway , if you are n't into the crazy larry clark films such as `` kids '' and `` bully '' , or any movies such as that , then this probably wo n't interest you a bit . oh , and to that reviewer at the top . . . megzi i believe their name was . . . .mischa barton who is great in the film , she does n't throw on a fake english accent in the movie . . . she really is from london . . . do your research first
