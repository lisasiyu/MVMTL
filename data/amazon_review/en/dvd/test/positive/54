brilliant ! these guys are terrific ! i 'm a student of shakespeare , so every time i read a play i have n't read before i pull out this dvd to see what they 've done to it ! after reading coriolanus i was rolling on the floor with their comments on how this play was n't appropriate for children . if you love shakespeare , or are just curious about shakespeare , buy this dvd
