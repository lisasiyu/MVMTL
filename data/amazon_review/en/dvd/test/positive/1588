my fave equestrain movie i saw this move about 5 years ago for the first time . i bought it as soon as i saw it on dvd . it is such a great story and it 's content as far as the eventing world goes is almost entirely accurate . it really should be rated more of a pg13 b/c of the language and some sexual content . it still is so worth buying .
