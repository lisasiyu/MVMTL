one of the classics i see some people saying this movie was not all it was said to have been . but you definately had to have seen this during the early 80 's to relate to it and it was only meant for the people that actually lived in this time era . for most of you seeing it for the first time in 2006 , it wont make sense to you and seem outdated . if your recollection of hip hop is n.w.a . or the likes , you will know nothing about this movie or relate to it in anyway - this is raw hip hop
