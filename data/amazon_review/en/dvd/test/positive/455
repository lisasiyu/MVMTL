amazing combat sequences given that no special effects were used and that the film took two years to complete ... . the aerial combat sequences are fantastic . the plot-lines are trivial , but universal . i think that the horrors of a seemingly endless war in europe are well presented . this quite an enjoyable film , particularly if you are conversant with howard hughs dedication to get it made
