gov't of the lobbyists , by the lobbyists , and for the lobbyists `` the big buy '' may not have the slick gloss of other documentaries , but the content is invaluable in understanding how american democracy has been hijacked . birnbaum and schermbeck show how tom delay deliberately reengineered the electoral system to create an incestuous alliance of lobbyists and government officials on a scale not seen before in american politics . this culture of corruption demands business representatives pay thousands of dollars for access to politicians -- akin to practices normally associated with self-serving third world governments . in the meantime , the interests of average americans are shunted aside . the documentary cautions that , even though delay has had to step down , others of his ilk have replaced him and are carrying on his legacy . another outstanding source revealing the magnitude of corruption that has taken hold is pbs 's bill moyers on america . the first episode , `` capitol crimes , '' connects the dots regarding jack abramoff , tom delay , grover norquist and others who brought an agenda to d.c. to buy out congress with a view to creating a permanent republican congress whose power derives from monies given to it by big business . one definition of fascism is a government aligned in partnership with corporate businesses . `` the big buy '' shows how tom delay has created that model for american in the 21st century . it begs the question -- as we now try to export democracy to other countries -- can we claim to be democracy anymore
