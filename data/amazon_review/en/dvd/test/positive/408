nice for an out of shape ex-dancer i had quite a bit of dance training as a child and teen , but have n't really danced for 20 years . also , i 'm a complete beginner at hip-hop , but wanted to learn a little just for fun . and it 's not like i ca n't walk around the block , but i 'd say i 'm a low level of cardio fitness . so this video is absolutely perfect for me right now . i did have to rewind a couple times on my first viewing , and i did n't quite get all the arm and head moves down the first time . but i 'm sure in a few sessions i 'll be doing the moves with some attitude . it 's probably going to get a little boring after a while , but i 'll try and extend the fun period by mixing it up with other videos and activities . at some point it is probably going to get too easy to be a good workout , but that will be a while . she does n't really break down the individual motions for you technique-wise , but they are pretty easy to pick up on . the instructor is a lot of fun , too . the only way this could be better is if there were several different workouts on the disc , or maybe options to extend the combination longer . you 're not getting a ton of content for your money . but i 'm happy with the purchase -- because i just wanted something not too intense and fun , for rainy days and to mix up my workout . one more thing - i consider some of the stretches questionable and dicey at best . i would never , for instance , use my hand to pull my neck into a stretch like she shows . be careful with these and modify them if you need to . i substitute different stretches as needed
