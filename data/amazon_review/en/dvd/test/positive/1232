american psycho - the book ( 1991 ) and the movie ( 2000 ) while i believe that the book is masterfully written , i kept asking myself when i was reading it whether ellis had a deal with the devil - who dictated to him the confessions of the worst serial killer ever . it is a brilliant description of the 80s - you can hear them , see them , almost touch them , they practically scream at you from the pages ; and dark portrait of the 80-th golden boy who went on the rampage . i did not think that there were one woman in the world who would enjoy that book ; to admire it , to respect it - yes but to enjoy it ... well , there was one woman , mary harron , who liked and respected ap so much that she decided to transform it to the screen - and it worked . she cut down on the gore and sex and concentrated on the satire . i liked the film when i saw it first time ; i love it now after the second viewing . surprisingly restrained and funny - it has one of the best scenes i 've seen in the films lately - the war of credit cards . the show belongs to christian bale - and he delivers as patrick bateman , the rich and beautiful 26 year old wall street banker with the secrets so dark that he makes dr. lector look like a sesame street character . bale 's cold , charismatic , misogynist turn is riveting . his james bondian-esque face changes to the devilish mask with the reptilian eyes so rapidly , that your blood would freeze .
