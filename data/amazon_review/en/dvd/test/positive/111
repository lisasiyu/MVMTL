who 's having a baby ? big fan of 80 's ... music and culture , and most of all the movies . she 's having a baby is not just a teen movie like `` sweet sixteen '' or `` breakfast club '' . its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day . soundtrac is great with kate bush `` the woman 's work '' . my girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played . i told her i 'll feel the same if she were the wife . boy i got lovin that nite ... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80 's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby , i thought it was clever .
