this movies looks awesome on blu-ray ! ! ! superman returns is a must have if you just recently bought a blu-ray player . i heard many negative comments about blu-ray as compared to hddvd before i bought my ps3 . i still have not seen an hddvd so i am not going to say anything negative about it , but as far as blu-ray every movie i have seen has blown me away . not only is the picture amazing , but the sound on my surround system is also much better . like i said this movie looks particularly awesome . i also recommend invincible on blu-ray
