awesome . a must have for anime comedy fans being a big fan of anime comedy ( the intelligent , yet lame humor ) i was eager to see el hazard `` the magnificent world '' . because of the high price of the set , i had some hesitation ( because of some poor reviews on amazon ) . well , i have to say that the bad reviews are wrong . this dvd series was totally awesome ( although i admit it started a bit slow ) . i promise the more you keep watching , the better it gets . the plot is highly intelligent ( involving dimensional and time travel ) and the characters are very interesting ( with distinctive special powers ) . some say the humor in el hazard is juvenile ( but i would argue no more juvenile then southpark ) , and seriously what good comedy is n't juvenile ? some also say that the story is sometimes too redundant ( because many episodes involve a doomsday device ) , to which i respond `` do we call the original starwars trilogy redundant because they involve the death star '' ? no , ofcourse not . yes this dvd set lacks some extras , but i think pioneer did a great job . the dvd menu presentation is beautiful , and the box is very elegant too . hopefully you can get this set for around 40 dollars on ebay ( beware of bootlegs ) . it 's very hard to find a good authentic set . the sequel `` alternative world '' which i just ordered , individually should cost around 30 dollars if you shop smart . for my fellow anime comedy fans , i also reccomend `` niea under 7 '' and `` his and her circumstances '' . animation=5 plot=4 music=4 characters=5 comedy=4 total= 4.4 star
