definitely worth buying i use this video as an adjunct to taking classes in both tribal and cabaret styles . the warm-up is thorough and the explanations throughout the dvd are helpful . the break-up of the choreography allows you to personalize your session goals . i have been studying bellydance for a little over a year and this dvd helps solidify the foundations and also provides enough of a challenge to keep me coming back
