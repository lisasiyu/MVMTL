i 'm 3/4ths the dvd i used to be ... . sing it , baby ! i 've been wondering how a 26-episode series could be completed with 4-episode installments . now , in retrospect , it all seems sadly obvious . just put only 3 episodes on each of the last 2 discs ... and charge the same price ! [ sound of metallic breathing ] do not underestimate the power of the dark side ! ! ! on the positive side , i guess the reason is that all three episodes on this chapter are of the `` complex '' variety and thus considerably advance the laughing man storyline . do n't get me wrong . this is a great chapter of stand alone complex , highlighted by a scene in which the laughing man pulls someone 's proverbial butt out of the proverbial fire . if there 's a weak part of this installment , it 's the sequence with the `` armored suit '' , which for some unknown reason goes back and yet again rips off elements of the big fight at the end of the first gits film , just as the `` testation '' episode had done several installments back . the armored exoskeleton could have been used to greater effect . by the end of this installment , almost the entire shape and design of the laughing man plot seems clear . it is interesting to learn from the special features that the murai vaccine plot was originally meant to be stand-alone material
