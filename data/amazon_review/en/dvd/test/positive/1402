hot and greasy , but well worth it . i saw this documentary last weekend at the river run film festival in winston salem and it was a smash hit . george motz did a superb job of uncovering one of our most treasured cultural icons in an entertaining and hillarious way , and that is saying a lot coming from a vegetarian . this guy has definitely got a great career ahead of him
