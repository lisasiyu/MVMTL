superb documentary what i find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that mr. moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts , and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void . the man is not only making a video to entertain you ( and this is wildly entertaining , in a factual and hilarious way ) but it also rests in an unarguable fact , the closure of the gm plants in flint michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it . whether or not you like they style of moore 's presentation , it is witty , backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of flint at this loss of future revenue ( or , more bluntly , its threatened economic survival ) and in the joining the impact that corporate america can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated , dollars and cents approach to the bottom line , moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other , as you often can not have one without having both .
