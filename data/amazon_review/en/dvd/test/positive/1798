surpassed my expectations i thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than i anticipated . david horton is such an interesting person and it was really great to be able to follow him thru this adventure of his . also , the movie did show aspects of horton 's life , including his classes at the local college he is a professor , his family , his running routine and his rd'ing .
