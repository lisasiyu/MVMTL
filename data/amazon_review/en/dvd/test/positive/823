bogart 's final film the harder they fall is a hard hitting expose of the boxing racket , and a racket it is . excellent performances by humphrey bogart , as a sportwriter turned boxing press agent , rod steiger , edward andrews , nehemiah persoff , and the always great ( and underrated ) jan sterling . an excellent screenplay by philip yordan , from a budd schulberg novel . mark robson 's direction is swift . ***** stars
