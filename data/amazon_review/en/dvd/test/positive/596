one amazing night i was very fortunate to have been a volunteer at the musicares person of the year tribute to james taylor on february 6 , 2006 . it was a spectacular evening filled with great music and a wonderful feeling . i have n't seen the dvd yet , but i am very much looking forward to it . if you 're a fan , this is a must have . stars performed james ' music and talked about what his music and life 's work has meant to each of them . i loved sting 's sweet and funny story about evaluating his own musical career prospects after seeing james play for the first time . performers and set list included : sweet baby james - paul simon shower the people - dixie chicks secret of life - india.arie you can close your eyes - sting everybody gets the blues - taj mahal and dr. john country road - keith urban millworker - bruce springsteen you 've got a friend - carole king ( and james ) copperline , shed a little light , fire and rain - james sheryl crow and bonnie raitt also performed , but i ca n't quite recall what . i 'm sure you 'll also get to see james interacting with his wife caroline and two small sons who were there . they seem like a nice family . i had the chance to talk to them briefly and james is as kind and caring as you would imagine him to be . i loved this special evening and am grateful to have played a small part in it .
