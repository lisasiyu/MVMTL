a parable -- facing death ** spoiler alert ! ** by the time most people got to the theater to see this film , or rented it , they already knew the ship and its crew would be dead in less than two hours . surprisingly , this does not diminish from the film 's power . even on second or third viewing , the film never delivers a moment that is false , maudlin , or sentimental . the plot is not what keeps people engaged during this film . it is the issue . how do people face death ? in this film , the people are the captain and crew of the boat . they know commercial fishing is a difficult and dangerous job , even when the weather is good . the weather is not good . the men need the money . they go out even though they know they will meet a storm . they are used to risking their lives every day . the storm turns into a hurricane that traps the men , and kills them . they struggle to save their own lives . they fail . when they are neck deep in water in a compartment of the overturned boat , they face death squarely . they talk , briefly , and unsentimentally , about things they will not be able to do , people they will miss . the stark , plainness of the acting achieves a powerful effect . at the beginning of the film , the viewer meets the crew . on repeated viewings , the film shows nothing milked -- nothing artificial . the men are solid , working people . there is no sappy foreshadowing . the director deserves kudos for maintaining iron-fisted control of a vehicle that could have been campy . the viewer will learn a lot about meteorology . the special effects are indistinguishable from live action . all the actors , including george clooney , maintain a stoic engagement with life , and they struggle to live , with no appeal to our pity , until they are dead . the perfect storm is more than a film . it is a parable . one could invest in such a classic work of art
