ingratiating comedy focuses on a circle of vacationing married friends twenty-five years since its initial release , this 1981 comedy from alan alda , its director , writer and nominal star , still holds up pretty well . in fact , i just saw norman jewison 's 2001 film , `` dinner with friends '' , which feels like a partial remake in following the friendships that evolve among married couples hovering around middle age . using vivaldi 's familiar string concertos as a transitional device , alda 's film concerns itself with three upscale couples who take vacations together every season , consequently we get four vignettes over the course of a year . it 's a contrived plot machination with no sense of climax , but it all seems to fit the contours of the story . jack is a lawyer who would like nothing more than have group therapy sessions with his friends , while his wife kate , a magazine editor , is a no-nonsense woman who sometimes gets frustrated with jack 's constant emotional insulation . danny is a neurotic , penny-pinching dentist married to claudia , an artist with the hot temper of her italian roots . nick is a philandering insurance agent who wants to divorce his wife anne , a housewife frozen by her self-doubts . it is the dissolution of this last marriage that provides the impetus for the group to examine the state of their relationships with their spouses and friends . the group starts out with a spring fishing trip when nick confides to jack about his need for a divorce , followed by a caribbean summer boat trip when nick brings his new nubile girlfriend ginny , a wide-eyed stewardess . the fall has them visiting their kids in college , and a soccer match proves to be a test of wills among the men to prove their virility to ginny much to the chagrin of the wives . the last piece takes them to a wintry cabin where true feelings are divulged , especially as ginny exposes the women for their vindictive exclusionary tactics . the acting is solid . alda seems to be doing a send-up of his own sensitive male persona as jack , and a wisely cast carol burnett is actually pretty subtle as kate . these two were such huge tv icons in the 1970 's that the impact of their goodwill is almost instant . as the most comic pair , rita moreno and jack weston provide most of the laughs as they banter and bicker like fred and ethel mertz redux . broadway actor len cariou manages the insolence and liberation of a husband set free , while sandy dennis brings a palpable dimension of sadness to the socially ejected anne . bess armstrong plays ginny with an apt sunniness masking a burning need for acceptance . the story leads to little beyond a funny sight gag and an implication that ginny will become more integral to the group , but the dialogue is often shrewdly observant and sometimes cannily witty . alda does n't quite have woody allen 's sharp acumen in producing genuine laughs out of the human condition , but the film generates a good time while it lasts . the 2005 dvd has no extras
