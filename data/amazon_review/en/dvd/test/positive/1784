this movie is a romantic comedy gem ! and ms. lopez is one classy lady ! ! ! this is a very enjoyable and lighthearted look at love through the eyes of two people who fall in love but try to deny their feelings for each other . ms. lopez plays a wedding planner who falls in love with the fiance of one of her clients . the scene where she has a little too much to drink is sweet , charming , funny and at the same time touching which is quite an accomplishment for any actress . ms. lopez is a lady of many talents . she can sing , dance and act and sometimes do all three at the same time ! she also proves she is much beter at this genre of film than the tiresome sandra bullock and meg ryan . encore ms . lopez ! !
