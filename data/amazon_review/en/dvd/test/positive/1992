dreams and magical realities sharkboy and lavagirl is like a painting without 3d glasses . put on the glasses and you experience a magical reality where dreams change your world and where the challenge is to overcome the nightmares . this movie is as much about facing fears and positive thinking as it is about special effects . it is especially impressive in this regard , with witty dialogue and spontaneous and unexpected turns of event . i found lavagirl to be a beautiful character with a loving heart and playful outlook on life . she sometimes forgets her powers and they use this for comic effect . she seems a little lost at first , as if seeking her greater purpose all while enjoying a playful combative interchange with sharkboy . the scenes take place in a school and in a magical dream reality . the characters move from real life to dreams in an instant and you can fall asleep and dream up a new reality in your dreams . it is all very fun and i found myself laughing throughout at the innocent humor and creative surprises . i think adults will get the `` brainstorm '' joke even more than children would and there is plenty of humor for adults and kids to enjoy . i also thought there were some amazingly profound moments during the conversations and if you realize what it would take to say those lines to someone who is a bully , that in itself should impress . on the fun visual side , lands of cookies and milk present culinary adventures as lavagirl , sharkboy and daydreamer max float through a world on a huge chocolate chip cookie . then you have a volcano and worlds of imagination reminiscent of a theme park ride . there is a mildy dark nemesis who is the bully and he aggravates the situation by appearing in max 's dreams . he steals max 's diary . i loved that max had a dream journal and how reading through the journal/diary made his dreams come true . changing the dreams , changed the settings and this presents the challenge . the amazing thing about this movie is how it was inspired by a child 's imagination and when you watch the extras , i think you will be even more impressed . i would love to see more movies like this because it reminds me of the hope we have as children and how we can still dream our worlds into life as adults . i think this movie gives children an empowering message and to be honest , some of the issues discussed in this movie could change a child 's world for the better . max is a great role model and his actions speak of a wisdom far beyond his years . as max learns to navigate his own imagination , he is really teaching children amazing lessons about how to navigate life . highly recommended along with the 3d glasses ! ~the rebecca review
