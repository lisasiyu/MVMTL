yes , i remember when ... ... i am not familiar with alan jackson as i am not a country music afficianado but that does not mean i dislike country music . i think country music is wholesome , down to earth and i can relate to it very much . not many songs on this dvd but the price is low so not much more can be expected . in my opinion `` remember when '' is worth twice the price of the dvd itself . after you watch it you might cry ( as i did ) or kiss your wife or hug your kids . beautiful , meaningful . you will not regret purchasing this dvd
