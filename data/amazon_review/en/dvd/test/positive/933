`` but carrots do n't grow on trees ! '' it does n't matter how you like your humor , straight up , or on the rocks , the black adder is your man . from the `` foretelling '' , where between liberal interpretation of w.s . combined with the ruthless , crazy , humor likened to the firesign theater , and a deep well of humor about their own `` bloody '' history , to the end of the disc- '' the black seal '' , if you do n't laugh for at least 90 minutes of its 180 minute length , and this goes for the first 3 black adder disc 's , and come away with a tired mind , keeping up with all the historical references , fractured or not , spun off by the excellent writing team of curtis & elton , along with a small cast of veteran engligh actors , peter cook , brian blessed , anon , anon , then i say you better have your funny bone looked after , because you are in danger of loosing your sense of humor . also i would suggest buying a copy of the black adder by penguin books . it will help , when the humor comes too fast and is in the kings english , because you do not want to miss one joke , reference , or twisted tale of this disc .
