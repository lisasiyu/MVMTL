worthy of the wealth it garnered , and the awards ... i liked this version of the titanic story when i saw it on the big screen , and i 've seen all of them except a silent reel made shortly after the sinking in 1912 . i 've been a titanic buff for 50 years now , and read most of the books . however , last weekend i went to a museum to see `` artifacts of the titanic '' , a collection of more than 100 items snatched up from the debris field two-and-a-half miles down , things once connected to the white star line or to individual passengers which survived 80-plus years underwater . it was incredibly moving and sad . connected with the exhibit was an imax showing of james cameron 's `` ghosts of the abyss . '' the `` titanic '' director took some of his enormous profits from this 1998 release , and in 2001 he rented a russian ship , two submersible submarines , and two robotic cameras , and went down to the wreck himself , taking along actor bill paxton from the movie . the resulting hour-long giant screen film is excellent . if you get a chance to see it , or the salvaged items , do n't pass it up . meanwhile , the movie works . so have most of the earlier versions , and so have most of the books , because the tragedy speaks to people of all ages and classes . the fictional parts of cameron 's film work better than the fictional parts of earlier movies about the disaster , in my view . seeing the artifacts and the wreck on a 58-foot curved screen made me want to see this movie again , on a big screen .
