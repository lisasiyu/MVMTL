we love it we caught classical baby : the art show on hbo and my son who was 7 months old at the time was mesmorised by it . the music is beautiful and the visuals are simple and eye catching . i studied art history and am impressed by the unique way of introducing fine art to an infant . my son still loves it now at 15 months and has learned to clap with the characters and he dances when the jazz song comes on . even my husband enjoys watching it ... over and over and over . we have the music show and the dance show too , but the art show is our favorite .
