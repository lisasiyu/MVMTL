hugely entertaining and rewarding mystery ok , i 'm not a film critic . i do like older movies , especially hitchcock mysteries and john wayne westerns and that makes me decidedly middle-brow . all i can say is that 'dial m for murder ' is a hugely entertaining mystery that rewards the viewer who pays attention ( umm , it is a mystery after all ) . several delicious plot twists
