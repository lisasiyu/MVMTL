better than vanilla sky this movie was much better than `` vanilla sky . '' `` vanilla sky '' mostly copied `` open your eyes '' but was too obvious and less convincing . ( and tom cruise , though good in some roles , did n't fit this role well . ) `` open your eyes '' takes a little longer to draw you in , but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where `` vanilla sky '' does . also , the jungian dream aspect in `` vanilla sky '' is poorly done , whereas `` open your eyes '' represents the dream experience very well . i recommend watching both movies before you buy one . but if you 're going to buy , get `` open your eyes .
