david attenborough is unbelievable this is a disc that contains six movies on it , each with a theme that revolves around one season in the antarctic and what happens during that time to the continent and the animals and birds that live in or on it . these movies are so realistically and clearly presented that you need a blanket to curl up in while watching attenborough walk around in freezing antarctica filming all kinds of creatures - on land , under water and in the air . the guy ( and his camera team ) are simply unbelievable . they spent three years filming these scenes . as anyone who has experienced anything colder than freezing can attest to , spending even a few minutes outside on a cold day can be daunting . but to spend all your time in temperatures of 74 below , with winds of upto 120 miles per hour - that is either sheer determination or insanity , or maybe a mix of both . whatever , the result is startling movies that are breathtaking , superbly shot , and extremely well-presented . i have watched most of attenborough 's films and they are all top-notch . he is definitely the world 's most amazing wildlife and nature filmmaker ever . he presents everything as is , without sentimentality , but with a clear sense of wonder at all the marvels he is depicting . when he speaks and shows you scenes , you feel you are there . hands down one of the top three wildlife films i have ever seen . highly recommended
