magnificent transfer by criterion i am not going to write about the merits of ran , i.e. , it is a given that it is perhaps kurosawa 's finest work . if you bought the previous masterworks edition and are sitting on the fence whether to purchase the criterion , do n't hesitate . the `` masterworks '' transfer is a travesty compared to the criterion . the colors just bleed in the masterworks , whereas here the colors are perfect and vibrant . on the masterworks dvd there is a restoration demo , which i thought was a joke since they did a lousy job compared to the criterion . get this dvd if you are a kurosawa fan ; you wo n't regret it . this is perhaps the finest criterion dvd that i have purcased , and i own over 40 criterions
