the perfect movie that makes guns useless . this movie has the realistic arts of violence with knives ( not guns ) . lt bonham ( tommy lee jones ) who is a military instructor who trained aaron hallam ( benicio del toro ) very well to become a killing machine . after the war experience aaron goes through in kosovo aaron can not seem to turn off his deadly technique skills of killing . now aaron gets out of control the cops ca n't stop him & opening fire at him wo n't help at all it just ends up with more casualties of cops and the only one who can stop him is lt which becomes a deadly cat mouse game and a gruesom battle between a teacher and a student which was a really good fight . this movie deserves 5/5 stars for good actors and a good storyline too .
