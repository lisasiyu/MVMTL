wonderful . das experiment ( oliver hirshbiegel , 2001 ) hirschbiegel , who stunned the world a few years back with der untergang , always had the chops to make tense , scary movies , and das experiment proves it . also based on a true story , this is a film about a psychological experiment gone horribly wrong , as twenty volunteers are put into a prison situation , with eight `` guards '' and twelve `` prisoners , '' for two weeks . by the second day , the guards are acting like guards , and the prisoners are acting like prisoners , with the exception of tarek fahd ( munich 's moritz bleibtreu ) , ostensibly a cab driver , but actually an undercover reporter ( while the revelation of this in the film is wonderfully done , the dvd box spoils this little surprise , so i have no qualms about mentioning it here ) who 's covering the experiment for his paper . things go horribly wrong in an astonishingly short amount of time , and while one of the doctors , jutta grimm ( andrea sawatzki ) begins to question the ethics of continuing the experiment , project leader thon ( edgar selge ) is enthusiastic about the speed with which everything 's going to pot . needless to say , things get out of control , and everyone involved , including the viewer , quickly becomes aware that no matter what happens , there is no way this is going to end well . hirschbiegel is a fantastic director , and here as in der untergang he 's got a solid stable of actors and a terrific script to back up his native talent . if you 've seen der untergang ( and even if you have n't ) , check this out . it 's well worth your time . ***
