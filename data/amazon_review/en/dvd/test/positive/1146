more show ! ! ! ! i really enjoyed this dvd because it had more of the show filmed than in the vhs riverdance - the show . it is a little bit of an annoyance that i have to flip it over in the middle . i definately like colin dunne 's dancing better than michael flateley 's , colin does n't seem to steal the spotlight away from jean butler as much as michael did . it gets my thumbs up
