intriguing and creepy , but rickman fans will love it anyway the acting is fine , but the story -- help ! the problem is not rickman 's or grant 's unsavory characters , but the propensity in too many small , independent british films to present lower-middle class characters as if they were slow . the message i get from all these films comes across as snobbish : that people are poor in britain because they are stupid . but stupidity by itself is n't funny anyway , although that point is lost on producers from both sides of the ocean . here , cate plays a girl who is more than young and naive as the adverts suggest ; she is a mentally handicapped and/or emotionally disturbed girl . ( the girl 's aunt and uncle are also unpleasantly slow . ) cate plays this very well , but her character becomes creepy and rather repulsive . on the other hand , rickman 's and grant 's reaction to her character is what gives this film its interest . rickman seducing cate 's underage character ( she does n't really look it ) is n't creepy at all and is the high point of the film , but maybe that 's because it 's rickman that does it . grant is excellent , playing a different role than usual , and he looks different and slightly goofy here too , a bit like terry thomas . but rickman fans will not want to miss this movie
