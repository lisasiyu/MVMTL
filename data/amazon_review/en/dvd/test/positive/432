to the person who said this is not a classic ... ... .. now , this movie may not have been known well when it came out in 1985 , but , it 's popularity grew as much as it has been shown on tv ( countless times ) . now , let 's say that john hughes produced this film ; i bet you that it would have been much better known if it had his name on it ; thus , at the time that this movie came out , john hughes had some big hits under his belt ( i.e . sixteen candles , & the breakfast club to name a couple ) . if it had molly ringwald as the lead actress , then it would have been a bigger hit . joyce hyser , however , wasn't/ is n't a very well known ( if known ) actress . so , alot of people really did n't pay much attention to this movie . i mean , what really big hit movies or starring roles did ms. hyser have really ? this and a few others were her only starring roles . from what i 've seen of her movies besides this one and another , she mostly had small parts . like , does anyone remember seeing ms. hyser in the 80 's classic `` valley girl '' ( starring nicholas cage ) ? the only scene she was in was at the prom at the end asking `` where are the cups ? `` , and , that was it . true , this movie may not be `` fantastic '' , but , it was alot better then some of those cheesy 80 's movies that came out around the same time . i personally think this movie was well-acted , and , cute for it 's time . it 's honestly underrated , but , by it showing on hbo , and , comedy central alot it 's popularity grew . hence , why they finally released it on dvd . it may not be a known `` classic '' , like , `` pretty in pink '' , `` sixteen candles '' , `` the breakfast club '' , and `` st. elmoes fire '' , but , it 's a classic in it 's own right . i think if better known at the time , people would n't of slepted on this classic . joyce hyser was wonderful in this role . and , i think it 's honestly her best , and , i am glad it 's finally being appreciated after 21 years ! i am soo glad they talked about it on vh1 's `` i love the 80 's 3-d '' last year .
