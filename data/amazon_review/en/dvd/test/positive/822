top tv film ! the truth shall set you free ... might be a more apt title for this little 'made for tv ' gem in which jim carrey stars in one of his first roles . 'doing time on maple drive ' is a powerful drama about one family 's cathartic acceptance of the truths which threaten to destroy it . on the surface , the carters are the epitome of the 'perfect ' suburban family . three handsome children , neatly trimmed front lawn , the flag waving outside . the all-american family . the first scenes tell everything . while the stars and stripes hang outside the front door , lisa carter ( bibi besch ) polishes the family pictures as if they were sacred relics , masks of a happiness that is conspicuously absent from this family . lisa sets the table for the arrival of their youngest son , matt ( william mc namara ) and his bride-to-be , allison ( lori laughlin ) . next scene and father ( james sikking ) pulls up the driveway with his eldest son , tim . the black sheep of the family , tim is just there as a sad reminder of what he 'could have been . ' he could have gone to west point if he had n't flunked out , if had he just done what his father had wanted him to do . and now , he is the household ghost , symbol of failure , burden to his parents . ignored , he takes to the bottle which further alienates him from his family . his father wo n't even let him pass through the front door lest mom smell the stench of alcohol . and this is just the tip of the iceberg . the carters are masters at seeing what they want to see . denied the successful son with tim , they place all hopes on matt . young and handsome , he soon plans to marry his yale sweetheart , allison and walk into the role of perfect child , fulfilling the wishes of his parents . and somewhat pushed to the back is the daughter , karen ( jayne brook ) . married and theoretically 'free ' from her family , she is still prisoner to her father 's expectations , rather than partner to her journalist husband . he wants a child , but she 's afraid her father might not approve . the film reaches its climax with skill and tension . and the clues that something is amiss are everywhere . why is n't tim going to be best man at matt 's wedding ? and why is n't matt 's best friend from yale being invited to the wedding ? smiles are forced , subjects are avoided and nobody listens to one another , until the outsider , allison , refuses to join the game . by chance , she finds a love-letter from matt addressed to his university friend , kyle , the one strangely missing from their wedding 's guest list . not only is matt forced to acknowledge who he is , he has to explain to his family why his bride-to-be has suddenly called off the wedding . matt tries to escape this confrontation by nearly killing himself . surviving the car crash , he still has to survive the even more painful crash with his family . will the carters survive the shattering of their wall of forced smiles , family photos , and lies ? 'doing time on maple drive ' does a wonderful job of dissecting the so-called 'dysfunctional family . ' the perfomances are tight and convincing all across the board , especially those of william mcnamara and james b. sikking . their father-son relationship is portrayed with power and tenderness . carrey 's performance is also tops , proving just how versatile an actor he is . my favorite though was lori loughlin . she managed to play the part of star-struck lover thrown a hard one brilliantly . she 's fascinating to watch as she starts to doubt matt 's honesty and is forced into a truly painful decision . ken olin 's film is a must for those of us who know the carter 's dilemma first hand . cathartic and instructive , 'doing time on maple drive ' leaves you with a guarded optimism , an affirmation that the truth can not only set us free but keep us together as well .
