amazing collection ... .all bonus features intact ! ! ! this is a wonderful collection ... ..normally in box sets you get a lot of fluff with a classic or two if your lucky ... .well this set offers up pretty much nothing but classics . harvey is of course a legendary film and performance by stewart and the bonus features on this dvd being the introduction by stewart himself is wonderful . the two westerns are interesting because destry rides again is a very very early film for mr stewart and something of a minor classic while winchester '73 is a major movie which many feel brought back the western in the early 50 's and also ignited a decade plus reign of mr stewart as a major star of westerns as well as working with this same director anthony mann on many occaisions . this version of winchester '73 ..while showing some age on the negative is pretty high quality but the bonus audio track which runs the feature length with mr stewart is priceless . so ... what 's left ? ony two of alfred hitchcocks greatet films ... vertigo and rear window ... ..the remastered versions which look great and feature wonderful bonus materials on the makings of the films and restorations of them ... . i do n't want to waste your time with plot lines etc ... for all 5 films ... .but want to congratulate universal for giving us `` all killer , no filler '' on this james stewart `` collection '' ... .a great value and a wonderful look at some of the most important work by this hollywood legend
