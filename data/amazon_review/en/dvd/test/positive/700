good retelling of a great anime series 'escaflowne ' , the movie , is basically a retelling of the popular ( and wonderful ) series . however the movie is a lot darker , a lot of characters in the series have been left out , and some events have been altered , so do not expect to see a movie that stays true to and anime series . for example , movies like ( cowboy bebop , 4 of inuyasha movies , 3 of dragonball movies , 10 of dragonball z movies , blue gender the movie , yu yu hakusho the movie )
