better than any tarantino film , period . that is coming from someone who love anything this director makes , presents , or endorses . i think this is a very complex and satisfying film . using the relatively unfilmed cities of la , such as hawthorne , compton , the real hollywood , it utilizes a more down to earth approach to real world crime . this is n't about a multimillion dollar heist , and the criminals are likeable and genuinely interesting even if one or two are full of themselves ( namely ordell and melanie . ) the film opens with the classic across 110th street as sung by bobby womack and featuring a strong pam grier , walking that moving sidewalk at lax . as the opening progresses she ends up possessing a look of worry on her face that shows a very strong woman 's strength become vulnerablity . from then on we meet a handful of excentric baddies and law enforcers , that are all likeable , interesting and have at least one or two funny lines ( with the exception of the cop who is n't michael keaton , who is just a plain jackass cowboy cop ) my favorite part is the friendship/romance between pam and the subtle and sensational robert forster . starting with a very special ride home , which bleeds to a bar , and then to griers apartment . all involve rich dialogue and interest shown . they bond thru body language , their age , and eventually music ( `` the del -- -- fonics '' . ) the fact that forster rushes to the nearest record store for his first delfonics tape is just plain cute , and shows he is falling for her music and all . the scenes between grier and sam jackson also need recognition . they are at times funny , terrifying , and very well acted . there is also robert diniro as an old friend/partner to jackson , and a few girlfriends of ordell 's such as surfer girl/pothead melanie , old sex siren simone , and super slow country girl sheronda . there is just a bunch of rich characters here , and they all give great parts no matter how big or how small ... especially chris tucker , who 's performance as a snitch is equal parts brilliant and hilarious . this movie just hits a right note for anyone interested in a talky , rich picture . tarantino says this is a movie for older people , well at 19 , i 'm definitely not younger , but this is my favorite of all tarantino films , be it because of the great soundtrack , storyline , performances , direction it makes no difference . it 's my favorite period . give it a chance and you 'll see what i see ... great movie
