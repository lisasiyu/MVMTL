comments from a ballet student i think this dvd is great ! there are many ballet dictionaries available but to see how the steps are done is more useful and clear than mere words could describe . unlike some other reviewers , i found the dvd quality to be fine . this dvd is an invaluable reference for any ballet student . although i have been learning ballet for only 2 1/2 years as an adult ballet student with no ballet background at all , i now take 8-14 classes a week ( with teenage students ! ) and have managed to reach level 5 and even do pointe work so i can say with the conviction of a serious ballet student that - this dvd is an excellent reference for anyone interested in learning ballet . i would recommend the dvd version instead of the vhs because it makes for easier and quicker selection of topics ( imagine having to rewind and forward on vhs ! ) . if you 're thinking of getting this dvd , go for it
