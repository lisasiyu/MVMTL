`` tom baxter 's come down off the screen and he 's running around new jersey ! ... nobody knows how it happened , but he 's done it . '' `` the purple rose of cairo '' was the first allen 's movie i saw back in moscow in the end of the 80s and it started my eternal love for his films . `` the purple rose ... '' is wonderful , is one if allen 's greats - a perfect combination of poignancy and humor , romance and drama , reality and fiction . it is the movie-within-the-movie that blends sophisticated romance from the lives of rich and beautiful where the dashing main hero with bravery and chivalry written into his character always gets a girl and depression era new york city where a poor waitress tries to escape the realities of her joyless life in the movie theater . the story focuses on cecilia ( mia farrow ) , a waitress and a battered wife of an unemployed abusive man ( danny aiello ) . cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities . one day , as she watches `` purple rose of cairo '' for the 10th or maybe 15th time , the leading man tom baxter ( jeff daniels ) decides to leave the movie and be with cecilia in real life . his screen partners are left confused and `` trapped '' in a scene they ca n't get out of . the live actor who plays baxter is blamed by the film 's producer for his character 's rebellion and tries to get him back on the screen . cecilia 's husband finds out that his wife was seen with a good looking man instead of working as a babysitter in the evening . on the top of all , tom baxters in other theaters try to leave `` purple rose of cairo '' , too ... it is not the first or last time allen has played with the concept of the thin line ( in this film , the silver screen ) that divides film 's world and reality but rarely has he created the film as sweet , gentle , sad , technically realized and simply terrific as `` purple rose of cairo '' . 9.5/10
