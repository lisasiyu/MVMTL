the best of the bunch i had watched the bananas special with jeff allen on it , but i wanted to see more , so i bought this dvd . it had a little more funny stuff on it , but the serious talk he gave for a portion of the show was great too . this is a seriously funny man that you should check out . one of the best comedians i have ever seen
