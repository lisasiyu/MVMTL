wonderful production of wilde 's best loved comedy this 1952 version of the oscar wilde classic romantic is as good to watch today as it ever was . michael redgrave stars as ernest worthing , ( whose name , in fact , is really john ) , a man who , as a baby , had been found in a bag in the cloakroom at victoria station . the story is a comedy of errors and confusions around names , in particular the name ernest . mr worthing wants to marry gwendoline , daughter of the formidable lady bracknell . he dare not tell his beloved that his name is not really ernest as she has expressed a desire only to wed a man of that name . gwendoline 's cousin , algernon , is pursuing mr worthing 's ward , cecily , but she does not know his real name , she believes he is called ernest . the comedy starts when cecily and gwendoline meet for the first time and realise they are both betrothed to `ernest worthington ' . the film stars margaret rutherford as miss prism and dame edith evans as the snobbish lady bracknell . both actresses play their roles extremely well , as you would expect from such grand dames of the stage . there are a few extras on this dvd ( region 2 version ) which include a profile of `the importance of being earnest ' , a `behind the scenes ' gallery , a theatrical trailer and biographies of the main actors and the director . the picture is crystal clear and the colours bright . sound quality is good and there are subtitles for the hard of hearing . all in all , a very good version of one of wilde 's best known and loved works .
