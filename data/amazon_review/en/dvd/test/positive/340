sadly overlooked action adventure comedy christian slater 's character reminds me of a young jack nicholson , who replaces his brother on the police force after he is murdered . i was surprised that he did n't become as popular as tom cruise after this film was released in 1992 , but he had a few personal issues during the 90s that stalled his career . i think he 's a better actor than most people realize , with much more talent than making below average movies like `` broken arrow '' .
