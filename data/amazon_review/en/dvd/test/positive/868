fans rejoice ! good buy for new and `` true blue '' fans alike ! freedom fighters forever ! the short review : way past cool ! if you 're a fan of the series you have to have this dvd collection ! the long review : episodes for anyone who 's had to stand watching cut or badly recorded episodes from tv , i ca n't express how good it feels to watch these in clear stereo with no tracking lines and perfect picture . i can even see the paintbrush strokes in the background art it 's so clear ! so far as i can tell , everything has been restitched back together wonderfully and i can see no weird edits . it 's just like i remember in ben hurst 's words `` fresh - like watching it for the first time ! '' bonus features a few people have complained about the lack of bonus features , but i ca n't say good enough about them . the series was produced 10 years ago , since then most if not all of the artwork in the vaults has been lost , sold online ( i 've seen a number of cels pass by there ) or locked away . the fact they managed to find even a small amount of high-quality artwork makes it well worth the trouble . i too wish there was more , but the stuff they did find is very good . i believe there are really only two bits of the extended/deleted scenes that are truly new material but it 's all well archived and the one silent animatic has the script super-scripted in so it 's easy to follow . the concept art is beautiful , there are a few new model/expression sheets in the interview with hurst and tons of background art that will blow you away . this is the same quality one would expect in feature post production work . both of the interviews are engaging , enlightening and even a little tearful at times , especially ben 's moving speech about season 3 and his support for the fans . considering how hard the crew at fus has worked to get this dvd , they deserve it . the dvd menus themselves are a blast -- i have seen a number of poorly produced menus with `` craptastic '' art in them and these blow me away . they are thoughtful and even funny ! in one part snively hits the `` bonus features '' button . it 's the little things like that which show the effort and care they put into making the dvd . box art okay so some of the artists who contributed art are very young and are n't what you would call `` good artists '' . but to me , it 's refreshing to see a company that actually wanted and accepted input from the fan base . it shows that we are all united together as fans of sonic , no matter what our background is . you can tell each of the artists was excited and trying their best to make something to show how much they love the show . i go as far to say a few of these artists are exceptional , some of them even drawing `` on-model '' as we in the animation business say . ken penders ( while not really a fan per se since he 's worked professionally on sonic artwork ) did a pretty good job with the cover , as it did include most of the cast and it does n't show anything that is n't there ( thank goodness his arms are n't blue either : d ) . compared to the first test cover , this final one is much better . dr. robotnik is the best part of the cover , he 's very well drawn . anything else ? just so you know where i 'm coming from , i was prime age when satam came out , being 10 at the time , and it is a big reason i am who i am today and certainly a reason why i 'm going into the animation industry . that being said i ca n't express enough why it 's important to support this release . they did a fantastic job . and i think it 's worth buying this for any sonic fan , especially if you know someone who likes sonic x -- in sonic 's words , `` get ready to rock , cause this will knock your socks off ! '' : ) if you 're new to sonic and like this series , i highly recommend checking out adventures of sonic the hedgehog , and sonic underground as well ( the other two shows produced by dic , the predecessor to satam and it 's later cousin , respectively . ) a lot of fans would say otherwise but i just ca n't get enough of the blue blur ! - joanie /^
