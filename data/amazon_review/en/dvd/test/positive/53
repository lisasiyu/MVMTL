this is just great stuff ... .. yes , my mock amazon name is dirk diggler ( long story ) , but this is `` boogie nights '' . i ca n't say this movie was `` over-looked '' , because it was n't . in fact it is really amazing that a film with this content was recognised for what it was and is , `` fan-f**k-ing-tastic '' . burt reynolds is back at the top of his game in years , marky mark can act ( dirk himself ) , heather graham , and all the rest are in top form . what can you say ? ? kinda a mock story of john holmes/70's/80 's porn scene , but you really start to care about these people . soundtrack represents the time and it all just works . i ca n't hear `` sister christian '' by nightranger without thinking of that scene . ( some of you know , others will ) get the new line 2 disc version . it 's impressive . if you have an open mind and can take it for what it is , this will become a favorite , i guarentee it
