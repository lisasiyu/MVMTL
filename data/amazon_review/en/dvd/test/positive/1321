a witty , humane , thoughtful movie directed by ernst lubitsch and written by samson raphaelson `` as henry van cleve 's soul passed over the great divide , he realized that it was extremely unlikely that his next stop could be heaven . and so , philosophically , he presented himself where innumerable people had so often told him to go . '' henry ( don ameche ) is greeted courteously by his excellency ( laird cregar ) . `` i presume your funeral was satisfactory ? '' the devil asks . `` well ... there was a lot of crying , '' henry says , `` so i believe everybody had a good time . '' his excellency explains that while he will consider henry 's request , there must be good reasons to avoid going up there . `` if you meet our requirements , we 'll be only too glad to accommodate you . would you be kind enough to mention , for instance , some outstanding crime you 've committed `` `` crime ... crime ... i 'm afraid i ca n't think of any , '' henry says . `` but i can safely say my whole life was one continuous misdemeanor . '' heaven can wait is the witty , nostalgic , gentle and surprisingly thoughtful tale of henry van cleve , philanderer , wealthy lay-about and a man far from noble . under ernst lubitsch 's direction and with samson raphaelson 's screenplay , heaven can wait is , as critic andrew sarris says , `` a hidden masterpiece . '' his excellency is intrigued and asks henry to tell him his story . henry believes that he can do this only through the women in his life , and , in one linear flashback , he does , starting as a babe in a bassinet . henry loves women , he loves the pursuit , he loves the pleasures of the chase , the theater , the champagne , the supper clubs . he 's spoiled , he 's optimistic , he 's endlessly inventive in finding ways out of being discovered . he may be innocently selfish , but it 's in an almost childlike way . `` oh , henry , '' his wife , martha ( gene tierney ) , says to him after being exasperated once too often , `` i know your every move . i know your outraged indignation . i know the poor weeping little boy . i know the misunderstood , strong , silent man , the worn-out lion who is too proud to explain what happened in the jungle last night . '' henry had eloped with martha the day he met her , under the nose of her fiance , his cousin albert ( allyn joslyn ) , a straight-laced lawyer who believes `` marriage is n't a series of thrills . marriage is a peaceful , well-balanced adjustment of two right-thinking people . '' henry loves martha deeply , but ca n't resist a beautiful face or a well-turned leg . even as a widower , with a grown son , his old habits remain a part of his character . yet he is so likeable and charming , henry van cleve rarely hurts anyone . after listening to henry 's story and despite all of henry 's tales of waywardness , his excellency sends him on his way ... but in an elevator going up , not down . he tells henry , you 'll find many people up there who love you and have been waiting for you . they will intercede for you ... because despite everything you made people very happy . this is a delightful movie that must have seemed either a relief or irrelevant to it 's time . it was made in 1943 and was popular , yet it ostensibly is about nothing much at all . the setting is the 1870 's through the start of the 1940 's . there is no reference to any outside forces in henry 's life , no world war i , no great depression , no rise of fascism , no moral messages . yet as the movie goes on we meet characters we come to either find amusing or to like , or both , and they disappear from the screen . their time has passed and , out of sight , they 've died while henry 's story continues . i was left , almost without realizing it , feeling optimistic and a little sad . life does pass us by , and it 's best savored by enjoying life without damaging others . among these characters are henry 's grandfather ( charles coburn ) , irascible and secretly ( and not so secretly ) envious of henry 's outlook on life ; henry 's father and mother , played by louis calhern and spring byington , obliviously stern and clueless and loving and clueless , respectively ; and mabel 's parents from kansas , played by eugene pallette and marjorie main , who have a great sunday breakfast scene battling over the comic pages while their butler is the intermediary . laird cregar , only 29 when he made this movie and dead little more than a year later , brings great , amused authority to the role of his excellency . gene tierney with her overbite was never more luscious . she did a skilled job as mabel , loving henry , understanding of his ways but only willing up to a point to be tolerant . the movie , however , is don ameche 's . he might have been a bland actor , but he is just about perfect as henry van cleve , well-intentioned , charming , constantly tempted and often frustrated . the movie seems to me to be just about a perfect collaboration between director lubitsch and writer raphaelson . they had collaborated earlier on two other great movies , the incomparable trouble in paradise and the shop around the corner . trouble in paradise has one of the most amusing screenplays you can find , and lubitsch brought to it all the urbanity and style he was known for . if you could choose only one lubitsch movie to own , i 'd unhesitatingly say to make it trouble in paradise . but i think heaven can wait would be second choice . the criterion dvd features a sumptuous picture transfer with rich color . the extras include a discussion of the film by movie critics andrew sarris and molly haskell and an interview with raphaelson by bill moyers . the case has an informative brochure with an essay about lubitsch and the film .
