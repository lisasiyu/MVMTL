a convincing vision of hitler in hell the great 18th century mystic swedenborg , who claimed prolonged visions of heaven and hell , reported that souls in hell do n't know they 're in hell because they 're behaving as they did in life ; the angels , however , look upon them and see them as terrible beasts . as i watched this profoundly engrossing film , i had no doubt by its end that it 's not just an artistic & quot ; turn & quot ; dealing with hitler 's psyche , image , and horrific legacy but instead is a powerful portrayal of him in hell . hell for hitler may well be eternal self-absorption and facile self-analysis punctuated by the rare inkling of consequences of his acts and awareness of the reality of others -- sporadic insights that reduce him to befuddled torment and ( his worst nightmare ) weakness . the actors ' portral of hitler and goebbels are brilliant , and the film itself left me shaken . it seemed not so much an artifice as a true vision of hell
