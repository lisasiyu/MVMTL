deeply moving i recommend this anime to everyone ( as long as you can handle scenes of violence directed at children ) . i 'm not one of those emotional types of people , but now and then is so profound that it even moved me . the animation is beautiful , and the voice acting is the best i 've ever heard ( note , my anime collection is small , so you may wish to take the last statement with a grain of salt ) . i was unsure when i purchased this , but after watching it , i am glad that i did . i do have some minor issues with the ending . at the end of each episode , which is how it is divided , is a preview of sorts for the next episode . to me , the preview before the final episode was a bit misleading . however , this issue is rather minute , and does not warrant a 4 star rating . edit : it appears my dvd player skipped at least half of the final episode . ignore the comments regarding the final episode
