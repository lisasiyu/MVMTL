grande damage imagine you are walking through a great art museum , overwhelmed by one massive canvas after another . in your rapture you almost walk right past a tiny painting in the corner , an unassuming , faultless vermeer . that is this movie . watch it on its own terms , in its own time , and you will certainly love it . ladies in lavender is a star vehicle for two british grande dames , judi dench and maggie smith - that 's hard to beat for star power . ( indeed , the only thing missing in this movie is helen mirren . ) almost everything except the plot fuels the story , the plot is so small it would be easily lost in the garden these sisters keep . place is massively important , and brilliantly recreated . pace is massively important ; these people lead simple , slow lives . most of all , emotional nuance drives the bus here , maggie smith can say more with a furrowed brow than any ten hollywood actors with a well-polished script . the film invites adult viewers to take an adult look at the many different forms love takes , and their consequences . from the bitter and cynical aging doctor , to the painfully vulnerable and naive ursula , dench , to the cool yet kind janet , smith , this film weaves leitmotifs with such a deft hand you barely notice . the young man , andrea , is played adequately by daniel bruhl , while olga , young , manipulative , and ambitious , is the girl everyone loves to hate because she seems to have it all . olga is played by natascha mcelhone . ms. mcelhone is fortunate to have been blessed with model-esque good looks ; if you look carefully you can see her being out-acted by a footstool , a washstand , and a pair of knitting needles . those who enjoy metaphor and symbolism will not have to meditate overly long before realizing that the love these aging sisters bestow on their innocent foundling is a give and take proposition . ultimately they commit the greatest act of selflessness any person can , they must free their `` child '' and let him live . ( irony here since they are what used to be charmingly referred to as `` barren . '' ) in so doing , they allow a great talent to bloom - sharing it with the world . this brings us to the film 's other star , joshua bell . bell provides the actual violin virtuosity behind the scenes , and his technique and range are chilling - from barn dance sawing rowdy enough to set the strad on fire , to subtle trills that could make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up . yes
