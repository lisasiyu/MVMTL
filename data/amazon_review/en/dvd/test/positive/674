about man 's goodness in the face of adversity kurosawa 's magnificent homage to the poor and suffering in the world . set in a rural health clinic in the 1800s , toshiro mifune plays the kindly but dictatorial head doctor , and yuzo kayama is a young , selfish , and self-centered intern who comes reluctantly to the clinic and learns humility . through magnificent acting and superior direction , the movie captures the heart-rending trials and tribulations of these peasant people . three `` stories '' predominate : a totally selfless man 's death-bed cenfession about his wife and his loyalty to her ; a 12-year-old girl 's learning that there are good people in the world ; and a 7-year-old boy 's family who takes poison rather than starve any longer . there is a haunting scene where women are `` calling back '' the life of a boy from a well , according to a folk belief . at three hours the movie is perhaps a tad too long , but it 's fair to say we do n't lose interest for a minute . kurosawa called this `` a monument to the goodness in man . '' indeed . definitely worth a watch
