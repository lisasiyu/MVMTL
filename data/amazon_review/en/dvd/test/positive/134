changed my perceptions of michael moore i saw the last half hour of this movie on the bravo network last week when i was actually looking for a rerun of `` project runway , '' so my first exposure to it was the segment with k-mart and the interview with charlton heston . wow . i ended up being grateful `` project runway '' was n't on . i made sure to catch `` bowling for columbine '' when bravo ran it again , so i could see the whole thing . they showed it again last night . i have to say here that , prior to this , i 'd never seen anything of michael moore 's ( except for one episode of `` tv nation '' ) and had never had an interest in seeing any of his films because of all of the negative things i 'd heard , including things moore fans had raved about that i thought were negative , such as the way moore confronts people in his films . what surprised me about `` bowling for columbine '' was what came across to me as michael moore 's compassion . i really got the sense that he cared very deeply about people who lost their lives through gun violence as well as about people who lived in unfortunate circumstances . i have much greater respect for him than i had before i saw the film . his motivating factor does n't seem to me to be so much political as moral . he truly is a moralist . he reminds me of the abolitionists of the nineteenth century that way . ( who an awful lot of people found annoying , if i need remind anyone . ) for him , i do n't think it 's so much `` corporations and other powerful entities are evil '' as `` people not caring about other people -- especially people not caring for those who are less fortunate -- results in separation and hostility between people , which leads to evil . '' well , shoot , they preach that in my church every sunday . and , last time i checked , we were n't socialists . also : i had heard , even from moore fans , that his interview with charlton heston was unfortunate and embarrasing . but i do n't agree . why should n't he have asked heston why he did what he did ? why on earth would heston have gone to denver and flint after what happened ? i just do n't understand it . some people said heston was obviously suffering from alzheimer 's and incapable of carrying on the interview . he seemed entirely lucid to me . he was lucid enough to get up and walk away because he did n't want to answer the questions . thank you , michael moore , for leaving kayla rolland 's photo behind . maybe charlton heston took it inside . maybe it made some kind of difference . peac
