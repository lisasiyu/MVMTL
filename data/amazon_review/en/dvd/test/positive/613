fade to black ... karen black ( burnt offerings ) burned herself into my memory w/ this 1975 tv anthology ! for 30 years i remembered the zuni fetish doll in the amelia segment , unable to recall much about the first two stories . well , i just watched tot again tonight , and i liked all three tales . while amelia is still my favorite , i found both julie and millicent and therese to be creepy and fun . karen black is a chameleon , changing from stuffy college professor- to evil murderess- to prim and proper prude to seductress , then terrified victim , and finally into savage huntress , all in under 80 minutes ! dan curtis ( night stalker , night strangler ) allows ms. black to show off her talent for making the strangest material seem believable , while letting her carry the whole thing almost single-handed ! this is one of those rare tv horror masterpieces that the 70s churned out . like duel , night stalker , the dead do n't die , etc. , trilogy of terror made it 's mark . i 'm glad to see it back on dvd ...
