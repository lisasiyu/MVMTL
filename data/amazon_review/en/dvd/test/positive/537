extremely watchable i had my doubts , but it turns out this film experience ca n't be denied . it 's formulaic , but also wiggy and raw and simply engrossing . damn funny as well . the acting and dramatic elements are consistently strong , and there 's no denying that terrence howard is an immensely talented and nuanced actor .
