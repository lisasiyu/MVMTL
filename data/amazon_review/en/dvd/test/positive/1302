liked the movie - hated the packaging ! i 'm writing this out of frustration . i saw the ending twice on hbo - free week-end - liked what i saw so decided to order from amazon . the only problem is that it arrived in a double dvd pkg that i have yet to figure out how to open . there is a red plastic piece on the right side . it can neither be pushed up / down - or flipped open . i tried to force it open prying with a knife - nothing has worked . those discs are inside for good . i 'm going to best buy tomorrow to see if their version has this same mysterious red tab . obviously i 'm the only one who has had this issue with getting the case opened . but , as i said before , what i did get to see of the movie , ( the last half hour ) on hbo . . . i liked . a slice of history that even if the details are made for the movie , was enlightening about the struggles that still continue in that part of the world today
