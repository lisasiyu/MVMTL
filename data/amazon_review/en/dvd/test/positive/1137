finally on dvd - and worth the wait ! i 've always had a soft spot for this cheese-fest from the 60 's , and since i am a major inger stevens fan , this is a must-have . the good news here is that the print is excellent , and has both the wide-screen version , which is the best version - lots of picture image is cropped out of the pan'n'scan version , as well as the `` full-frame '' pan'n'scan chopped up version for those that insist on these inferior video image displays . tons of cool cameos , fantastic title song by the turtles make this a winner . no extras other than the trailer , but i say if you liked this movie in the past or just like those wacky 60 's sex-comedies this is an essential purchase .
