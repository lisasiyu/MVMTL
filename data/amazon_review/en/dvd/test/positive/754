a very good romatic comedy let me first say i think this was one of julia roberts best roles in a film . and hugh grant plays a very low key laid back guy not without dry wit and humor . even though this could never happen in real life , it is a charming film . my wife and i saw it in the theatre and own it on dvd . this film works on several levels . the humor and the romance with some clever writing . grant 's unasumming casual character , william thaker , is changed when he meets megastar anna scott ( roberts ) in his travel book store and she is browsing through books on turkey . grant , `` that book is not very good if browsing turns into buying , whereas this author ( holding up a different book ) has actually been to turkey . '' she leaves the store and he later bumps into her on the street and spills orange juice on her , creating the need for her to change her clothing . grant lives just across the street . so the romance begins . grant 's roommate , spike , is quite a character . a slovenly smoker , who does n't wash his clothes or clean up after himself . a quirky kind of guy that ads some comedic moments to the film . grant 's sister in the film is totally the opposite of his character . overally talkative , wild hair , wide eyes and they do n't resemble each other . you have to suspend belief that she could actually be his sister . grant 's friends are believeable and quite funny at times . when his good friend is driving through london and everyone in the car is trying to give him directions he slams on the brakes and tells them to be quiet , `` james bond never has to put up with this kind of sh** . '' the musical score works quite well i believe . i enjoy many of the songs from the cd , with the exception of `` she '' by costello . his voice is wrong for the song . the beginning and ending scenes of the film have the song . it would have been better to close the film with `` when you say nothing at all '' sung by ronan keating . the song is used quite well in a previous scene in the same setting . shania twain sings `` you 've got a way in the closing credits and boyzone also contribute with an abbreviated `` no matter what '' written by andrew lloyd webber in the closing credits . one of the best uses of a song is bill withers `` ai n't no sunshine '' sung as grant walks through scenes showing the passing of time by the change of seasons . very well done . knowing how the press hound celebrities it is difficult to believe anna scott , a mega film star with pictures everywhere , is not followed by papparazzi every time she leaves her london hotel and that people do n't recognize her when she is with grant in public . i would recommend this film
