good , cheesy fun first of all , this review is based on the original ( subtitled ) version , not this disney-edited dvd . do n't watch this movie expecting something of the caliber of crouching tiger hidden dragon ; you 'll be disappointed . an obvious take-off of stories like the three musketeers and with a mood similar to the batman movies , this film is often confusing and melodramatic , at times simply absurd . that said , the acting is decent and the fight scenes engaging , making for an enjoyable film . it 's entertaining , if not earth-moving
