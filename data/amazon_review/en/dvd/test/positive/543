5 stars are not enough omg - this dvd is fantastic ! disc 1 is not quite as good as disc 2 but that does not detract from how oustanding this set is . lots of extras - some better than others . the time spent re-mastering everything was time well spent . the effort that went into this tour is mind boggling . a lot of times i just put it on and play it as background music - it even works as a 'pink floyd greatest hits ' soundtrack . sometimes my tastes do not coincide with those of my friends ( e.g . les claypool dvd ) but everyone i have played this dvd for wants their own copy . if you are a pink floyd fan - get it ! you will not be disappointed .
