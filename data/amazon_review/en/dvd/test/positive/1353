rainbow featurung ronnie james dio who was rainbow and are they any good ? rainbow was birthed out of famed guitarist ritchie blackmore 's departure from supergroup deep purple.his impression of lead vocalist , ronnie james dio 's group ( elf who was opening up for deep purple ) , led to his proposition into forming rainbow.this group , rainbow , established dio as the premier heavy metal vocalist that would later define metal as we know it.it would prove to be part of dio 's path of successful stepping stones before joining black sabbath prior to his own highly successful solo career in the 1980 's . the 1970 's : there was n't the sound equipment available that we have today nor did the avereage individual have the means to play any form of music videos.so when it was filmed , it was never intended for a professional release.thankfully , it was filmed and it is great ! this is an era that was n't about all the show , , , it 's about the music ! it sounds as good as the records did from that era and with an opened mind you will see that this is a true gem to be relished . hope you enjoy it as much as i did ! !
