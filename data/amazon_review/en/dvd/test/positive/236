`` rockin ' from the delta to the dmz ! '' good morning vietnam is one of robin williams ' earliest forays into drama . while the world according to garp is arguably his first attempt to be taken seriously and blend his comedic sensibilities with drama , good morning maintains a much better balance . the first half of the movie is an anarchic anti-authoritarian comedy while the second half has the comedy take a back seat in favour of an unrequited romance and the growing insurgency in saigon . mitch markowitz 's screenplay makes a smooth transition between these two halves by doing it gradually with elements of comedy and drama blending together naturally so that neither one is entirely abandoned in favour of the other . director barry levinson successfully harnessed the comedian 's wild , manic energy in this movie . of course , the williams ' radio monologues ( famously adlibbed by the comedian ) are the highlights as he cuts loose with his trademark rapid-fire humour ( `` what 's the difference between the army and the cub scouts ? cub scouts do n't have heavy artillery. '' ) . williams is an actor who needs a strong director to rein him in . his best movies are the ones where he collaborated with a director who had their own distinctive vision ( peter weir , terry gilliam and gus van sant ) and this one is no different . even though good morning is essentially a vehicle for williams , levinson wisely surrounds him with a strong supporting cast of character actors , like robert wuhl , bruno kirby and j.t . walsh . along with oliver stone 's heaven and earth , good morning vietnam gives a human dimension to the vietnamese people . unlike many other vietnam war movies of the `80s , the vietnamese are not portrayed as some anonymous enemy but real people with their own distinctive personalities . this incarnation is an improvement over the previous dvd . there is a six part `` production diary '' that runs 34 minutes . this is a retrospective look back at how the film came together and just how much of it is based on the real adrian cronauer who is interviewed . he sets the record straight and even talks about the origins of his famous sign-on ( and the film 's title ) . director barry levinson talks about robin williams ' extensive improvisations and how the director knew when to let him go and when he had to stick to the script . one part also focuses on the film 's fantastic soundtrack of `60s rock `n ' roll music and the role it played in the movie . another segment focuses on the actual shoot that took place in thailand and the logistical nightmare of filming there . add to that the extremely hot weather which , incidentally , gave the film a certain amount of authenticity . there are lots of good anecdotes told but sadly , only cast members bruno kirby and robert wuhl are back with williams no where to be found . `` raw monologues '' features 13 minutes of footage from williams ' radio monologues that was not used or alternate takes of some of the jokes . there is some pretty funny material here but it is fascinating to see this material in rough form , watching how williams would refine it by dropping some bits and keeping others with slight variations . finally , there is the original teaser and theatrical trailers
