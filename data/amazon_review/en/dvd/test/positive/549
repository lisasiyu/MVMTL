best show on television ! ! ! ! ! ghost whisperer was the only show last season that i set aside time to watch each week . i thoroughly enjoyed each episode and ca n't wait to own the first season . andrea 's death was so very sad . i hope she 'll be back for the occasional guest appearance , or should we say `` ghost '' appearance . looking forward to each and every episode of the new season
