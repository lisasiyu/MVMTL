`` our daddy 's gon na kill you , preacher ! '' i think that line ( spoken by a crowd of evil children before they beat up an unarmed , chained russell crowe ) sums up the movie well . this movie does an excellent job of communicating the sheer glee of sadism . everyone in this movie ( with the partial exceptions of stone and crowe ) do n't just like to inflict pain on others - they enjoy it . they cackle and quip and snicker and guffaw as they blast enormous , ragged , bleeding holes into people . this is an excellent ( if somewhat garish and comic-bookish ) look at an evil that has infected a whole town . imagine eastwood 's more sinister and sometimes turgid attempts ( high plains drifter and unforgiven come to mind ) , but with a wink and a sense of humor . more slow-mo than the olympics . pioneered the bullet cam that has since been done to death . ms stone shows a lot of leg . so , it 's got a lot going for it is what i 'm saying .
