maugham 's famous story & swanson 's finest silent performance during his lifetime somerset maugham ( 1874-1965 ) was best known for such novels as of human bondage and such plays as the circle ; today , however , he is chiefly recalled for his short stories , of which the 1921 `` miss thompson '' is easily the most famous . the original story was soon adapted for the stage under the title rain -- and it was a tremendous success . the play has been performed countless times and continues to be revived on a consistent basis ; there have also been three major screen adaptations . the best of these is the 1928 silent film sadie thompson starring gloria swanson ( 1897-1983 . ) swanson was perhaps the first hollywood `` diva , '' an actress as controversial as she was popular . by the late 1920s her liaison with the infamous joe kennedy ( father of john , robert , and ted ) gave her the clout to become her own producer , and with kennedy money behind her she selected the maugham story and cast herself in the title role . it was an inspired choice . swanson had somewhat hard features and tremendous attitude , and many consider that this is her best overall performance . the story concerns the collision of a brash prostitute ( swanson ) and a holier-than-thou minister ( lionel barrymore ) who find themselves trapped by quarantine and monsoon rains in a rundown hotel on pago-pago . needless to say , the sparks fly -- especially when davidson pressures the island govenor to deport sadie as soon as possible . but it gradually transpires that davidson may have more than one reason for wanting sadie gone : it may be that he finds her a temptation himself . sadie thompson would be swanson 's last great success in the silent era -- the later queen kelly was never finished or widely released . but like most other silent films , it was buried by the advent of sound , and over the years the final ten or fifteen minutes of the film was completely lost . without a conclusion , it was rarely shown even after interest in silent films revived . fortunately , kino has been able to restore the conclusion with a mixture of film fragments , stills , and title card recreations , and the brazen sadie , the dour dr. davidson , and the statement made about intolerance , tempation , and hypocrisy live and breathe once more . the picture quality shows age , but on the whole it is quite good and probably the best available short of digital restoration . the bonuses are slight but interesting , including comparisons of key scenes from the original story , the playscript , the 1928 swanson version , and the 1932 joan crawford version , which was titled rain . ( comparison with the 1953 rita hayworth version , titled miss sadie thompson , is not made ; this version , however , is negligable . ) kino video has done a tremendous job of restoring , preserving , and once more making this memorable film available . if you 're a fan of maugham , swanson , or silent film in general , sadie thompson is a must-have . gft , amazon reviewe
