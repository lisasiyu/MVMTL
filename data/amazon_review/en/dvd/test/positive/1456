it only gets better from here st . elsewhere remains my absolute favorite tv show , and it even ranks high among all of the other forms of entertainment that i enjoy , like movies , music and books . it 's the first show i remember watching that achieved a certain level of realism with its characters , and that had continuing storylines without being a soap opera . you could watch each episode without having seen previous ones , but you were definitely rewarded if you watched each week . it was also the first show i remember that was n't afraid to take risks with its many characters- they were n't perfect people , and sometimes very bad things happened to them . st . elsewhere was intelligent but highly entertaining tv , and it ( and hill street blues ) paved the way for some excellent shows today that maintain similar standards . and so i 've waited for a long time for st . elsewhere to be on dvd . i 'm not disappointed , but the first season is definitely different from later years . i do n't remember much of the first two seasons , but it seems to me that the show hit its stride in year two and peaked in it third and fourth seasons . the first season is very good , but the characters have n't been developed quite as well as they would later , and its hard to be invested in some of them knowing that they would disappear after the first season with no explanation . also , some of the storylines ( especially those involving the psychiatric wing of the hospital ) seem silly and unrealistic- almost more like something out of a sitcom than from a serious drama . still , though , this is where it all started and it 's clear that the groundwork was being laid for a great show . minor details mentioned here will become major storylines later on , and events that impact characters now will play even bigger roles later . there are many genuinely emotional and dramatic moments , as well as interesting and well-written stories about medical cases and , more importantly , about the personal lives of the employees at st. eligius . it would have been nice to have more extras , as other reviewers have mentioned , but i 'm glad that the first season is fully intact ( although it seems like they did substitute some of the songs- that is definitely not bruce springsteen singing `` born to run '' in the first episode ) . it 's frustrating that there is no word yet on future seasons , but hopefully sales will be enough that we 'll get the complete show in a relatively short period of time .
