one of my all time favorites ca n't believe it 's been twenty years , but this movie is still just as funny today as when it came out . great script-a perfect cast and more laugh out loud moments than should be allowed . how steve martin 's character made it through this trip through hell ( some times literally ) without murdering his thrust upon companion is just beyond me . the whole `` you 're driving the wrong way '' scene is truely a classic as well as the question : 'where is your other hand ? ' . absolutely a joy . highly , highly recommended
