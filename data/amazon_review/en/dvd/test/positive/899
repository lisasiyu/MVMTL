smartly funny i do n't write reviews , and i do n't purhase movies but i 'm doing both for this one . what a great movie . in a time when most humor has really stupid sophomoric humor , this movie is smart , fast , clever and unexpectedly expected . enough said . rent or buy this movie . watch it and prepare yourself to watch it again . get a kleenex because you 'll laugh so hard you 'll cry .
