this is great . i am so glad that i ordered this dvd . i recently bought a knifty knitter set from herschners online store and a couple of books here on amazon on how to use them . while the books are n't that confusing , this video cleared up a lot of questions . it was great to see the priojects done in first person view . they are very easy to follow . : ) the dvd gave me a better understanding of what was being done on the loom . i can now follow the books prett easily . thanks
