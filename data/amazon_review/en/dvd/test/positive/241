shoulda been a star good action movie . i actually saw this in the theater ( yes , it did have a theatrical release ! ) back in the day . this was about the time when cheap action and horror films were starting to disappear from theaters . excessive force would be straight to video if released today . pity , coz it 's pretty fun . thomas ian griffth never became the next seagal or vandamme-something the producers were obviously trying to do with him-but he really does the action tough guy thing wonderfully . he even had a hand in the script . he 's got the look and the moves , he 's even a decent actor . he went on to do some direct to video action pics , and played the lead vampire in john carpenter 's vampires . you may also remember him as one of the villians from karate kid iii ( the guy who teaches daniel how to break noses ) . other than that , the guy is virtually unknown . the plot does n't offer anything groundbreaking in terms of cops/robbers action , but it 's a cliched film done well . it 's got a better than average supporting cast of james earl jones , lance henriksen , tony todd ( the candyman himself ! ) , and burt young ( paulie from the rocky movies ) . these guys must have also seen potential of the script to want to appear in it . good supporting actors , a good script , and a good performance from the lead raise this otherwise by-the-numbers action movie up a few notches to something quite entertaining
