love this movie `` when harry met sally '' is one of my favorite films . it 's one of those movies you can watch again and again , and never get sick of it . billy crystal and meg ryan are hilarious , and bruno kirby and carrie fisher are excellent in their supporting roles . i ca n't recommend this movie enough .
