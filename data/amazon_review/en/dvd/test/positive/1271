critics missed this one ... ... and they caused me to pass it up for about 20 years , too . i do n't recall many kind words about this movie when originally released . most reviewers never got past the notorious scene -- you know the one i mean . how sad . anyway , i took their word for it , movie sucks , do n't waste your time . they were so wrong . i finally saw it this weekend . wow . what an outstanding little thriller . and , i got ta say , a fairly important film . along with jacob 's ladder , this seems to anticipate almost every major thriller of the past 15 years . but this one came first , and it may be the stronger film . rourke is terrific . seeing this , it 's hard not to wonder how different his career might have gone if the critics had n't chosen to make him their personal whipping boy . i 'm not quite ready now to rush out and snag copies of 91/2 weeks and wild orchid , but i 'm thinking about it . they were so wrong about this one ... maybe these others were n't celluloid vomit , either . anyway , excellent film . if you 're a horror / thriller / mystery fan , and have steered away from this one because you did n't want to see the cosby kid defiled , i 'd encourage you to give it a chance . and if as it unfolds you 're thinking , man , this is pretentious trash ... well , hang in there . when the story is over you might feel differently . only complaint . deniro 's character 's name . come on . as effective as the movie was , it might have been that much more so if they had n't telegraphed deniro 's character every step of the way
