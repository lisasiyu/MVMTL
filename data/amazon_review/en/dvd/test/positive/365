hilarious example of how deadly-funny dark satire can be the bite to this movie comes from its near-perfect insight into what high school , overachievers , bored teachers , society , competitive people , politics , and marriages mired in ennui are all about . it 's smart , it 's incredibly funny , and it gets the most out of a very good cast . election , set in the 1990 's at a school outside omaha , tells the story of a frightening human dynamo , a senior who wishes to cap off her near-perfect career in high school by being elected to the student counsel presidency . as played by reese witherspoon , tracy flick ( whose last name spelled several times in the movie all in capital letters -- - '' flick '' -- -looks suggestively like another word ) sees the office as the next logical step in her sociopathic upward climb toward a full scholarship to georgetown . tracy has a single-mindedness that borders on mental illness , and a ruthlessness powered by a vicious drive that at times seems genuinely scary to behold . this uber-overachiever has been top of the honor roll for years , and has headed a number of extracurricular clubs , from being editor of the school yearbook to ... you name it . she has also destroyed the life and reputation of a teacher who grew carelessly fond of her , and before election is done she does-in another , here played by matthew broderick . broderick 's social sciences teacher , mr. mcallister , senses the destructive force tracy let loose on post-high school society might become , and he makes it his mission to sabotage her bid to become class president . first mcallister convinces the school 's dopey star athlete , played chris klein , to oppose tracy in the election , and later mcallister crosses the line and uses his position as head of the election committee to make certain tracy loses . the meltdowns that occur to several key characters in election are at times played off as funny but more than once the makers of this movie were courageous enough to let them be disturbing , particularly the scene where tracy , believing the outcome of the election has not been in her favor , breaks down emotionally , revealing the insecure , needy figure beneath her extroverted exterior . election is comedy at its smartest . the writing is polished , the delivery of these stunningly perfect lines is flawless , and the humor mixes cerebral parody with at times a fun version of crudity . it 's one of the best dark comedies of all time
