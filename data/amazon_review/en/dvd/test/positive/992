great collection and price ... this is a wonderful selection of the martin and lewis colgate comedy hours . the show used revolving hosts , and eddie cantor and martin and lewis were by far the most popular . for those that are only familiar with the team through their films , this collection will be a revelation . the duo 's television appearances are only a slightly toned down version of their live act-and that was legendary . the show dates are not indicated on the packaging , so here they are : 1-2/4/51 , 2-1/25/53 , 3-11/4/51 , 4-4/29/51 , 5-12/19/54 ( next to last appearance ) , 6-11/13/55 ( last appearance and the next-to-last episode of the show ) , 7-no date can be found , but it is the 8th anniversary of the team on the comedy hour , broadcast from atlantic city . the set also includes trailers for some of their films-great stuff , especially for the films filmed in vistavision , where the process is promoted as much as the team . ( & quot ; bigger , brighter , funnier ! & quot ; ) grab this one
