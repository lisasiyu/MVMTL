hugh laurie is the best actor on television - he has no equal house is the best show on television . there 's never been a medical show like this - ever , and i 've seen just about all of them . and to have someone of hugh laurie 's caliber and immense talent is such a great treat for viewers . there is nothing this man ca n't do . brilliant and genius are overused words , but in his case , they more than apply . his background in so many british comedies prepared him well for the role of house , but what 's so amazing is how he can go from making you laugh one minute , to playing pain and drama like nobody 's business . the dvd 's are so clear and sharp , and those mesmerizing blue eyes of his are just mind boggling ! when the light hits them a certain way , you can not look at anything or anyone else in the scene . hugh , if you 're reading this i know you hate hearing it , but you are brilliant and sexy as hell ! ! ! ! the best show on television , bar none
