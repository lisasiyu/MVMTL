dreamgirls i went to the movies with the thought that i probably would not like this mover and was pleasantly surprised . i love the freshness that all of the actors brought to their roles . i am not what you call a beyonce fan , but i found myself enjoying her in this role . i have always loved musicals and ca n't wait to add this one to my collection . my grandchildren loved this movie as well and constantly sing all the songs .
