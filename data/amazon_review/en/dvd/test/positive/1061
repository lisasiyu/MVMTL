four stars for originality ... ... it is about a comet that destroys all people who were exposed to it while it was passing through earth . only a few survivors are left , and some who were n't directly exposed begin to turn into `` zombie '' like creatures . this is a fun 80 's flick , with an original story . a good addition to your movie library
