nothing new , but is n't that the point every now and then we sould honor the memory of morse and john thaw . inspector lewis does that plus it brings some closure to the other key character . so the author of this screen play is no colin dexter and reverted to remaking hamlet - at least it is admitted in the dialog itself . very predictable plot twists and well crafted ending . all in all , 5 stars if you 're into morse . skip it if you are n't
