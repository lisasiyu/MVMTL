do n't hesitate to buy rent i borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it , i was n't quite sure how i would feel about it . after watching it , i have to say that i love this movie and bought it the next day . regardless of what critics have written , i loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made rent a success . yes , they are supposed to be in their 20 's in the play but really , i barely noticed or frankly , could 've cared less . i love jesse l. martin and he was fantastic . idina menzel 's voice is super and was ever surprised that rosario dawson could sing . anthony rapp , adam pascal , wilson jermaine heredia and tracie thoms were great as well . yes they changed and omitted things that are in the broadway play , but if you are truelly a fan of rent , you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present : the wonderful songs !
