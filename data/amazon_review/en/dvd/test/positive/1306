not as great as `` charlie parker '' bird , is a film about the life of jazz great charlie `` the bird '' parker . forest whitaker is doing a great job as charlie parker and the story is generally loyal to the real life , except one is lead to believe that `` chan '' was his wife ( in real life , she was n't ) . one negative thing i felt was that the scenes were overly dark throughout the film . i think the director wanted to create an atmosphere of reality but in my opinion he overdid it to the point of annoyance . another critisism is for a film about charlie parker , his talent on improvisation , his creativity could have been , and should have been emphasized more . there is a scene where he asks a friend to write a piece that he composed just that night and the friend wants to do it in the morning but by the next morning , charlie does n't even remember the piece , or even the conversation that took place . this is a good example but his creativity could have been emphasized with more examples like improvisation . in real life , charlie parker played the same piece of music differently almost every time , with some additions here and there , givin it a new mood , new angle , new taste . this could have been shown . however , despite these minor shortcomings , i think the film is a very good one . for charlie parker fans , i also strongly suggest the book `` bird lives '' by ross russell
