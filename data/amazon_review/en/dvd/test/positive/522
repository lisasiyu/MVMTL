deep and moving remains of the day requires the viewer to be observant . anthony hopkins takes on the challenge of playing a man who is emotionally repressed and self-effacing , a butler who has complete , blind faith in his master and thinks only to serve him . hopkins is such a gifted actor that he can slip into the role seamlessly while still suggesting - so long as you watch closely - private emotions in this restrained and stilted figure . these emotions are often not fully understood by his character or dealt with properly , but hopkins puts them there - they might be revealed in a gesture of the hand , a jaw unhinging slightly , eyes lingering more than is strictly necessary . hopkins is simply fascinating to watch . he plays the butler stevens , who in the years leading up to wwii serves lord darlington in a grand english country house . stevens is loyal to his master ; he never questions him , never eavesdrops on his conversations , and assumes that his master has a great and complete understanding of the word . lord darlington , however , turns out to be a nazi appeaser ; he wishes to play it safe and make a deal with germany rather than go to war . he holds a gathering of like-minded noblemen and high officials in his house , where only one american politician , lewis ( christopher reeve ) , contradicts him and his policies of appeasement . when darlington asks stevens to remove two housemaids who are jewish refugees , stevens does so with some confusion but without argument . after all , his master understands more than he . he has to attend to the guests at the gathering , deal with his elderly father , an underbutler , who is growing too old for his duties , and handle the housekeeper , miss kenton , who has no problem contradicting stevens and disturbing what little private time he sets aside each day for himself . emma thompson plays miss kenton with honesty , intelligence , and vitality . the conversations between kenton and stevens often seem to be in some kind of code - on the surface they speak of housekeeping matters , or perhaps that sentimental book that stevens reads in private and attempts to conceal ... but matters of greater urgency are touched upon . stevens is affected by kenton , but seems immoveable as stone ; he has sacrificed too much of himself to his service , and he is couched in duty and routine . he can easily see if a single spoon is missing from the dinner table , but can not put words to his emotions , such as they are . would it ever be possible for him to change ? just as darlington 's loyalties were grossly misplaced and repented too late , perhaps stevens will also find himself only with regrets . remains of the day is a fine , moving , nuanced picture , with rich performances .
