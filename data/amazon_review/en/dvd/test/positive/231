in-credible , make yourself by this ... . ... the fact that out of 19 reviews 17 are 5star says alot about this dvd . im not going to go off on one about this as i dont have time to ( i know i 'd get carried away as theres so much to comment on this ) but basically i thought the morning view sessions were a good demonstration of incubus live , volume 2 is great , especially the live cali-accoustic tracks ( awesome ) but this concert is unbelievable , so so good ! highlights for me are for a start seeing alot of the crow left of the murder tracks live as the album is brilliant & has grown on me so much over time , but also just seeing how well incubus can improvise & adapt their songs to sound even better live . theres a great version of `` drive '' here , but the lengthened versions of `` sick , sad lille world '' & `` a certain shade of green '' are amazing . the guitar work on `` s , s l w '' , `` priceless '' & `` pistola '' is brilliant . other greatly performed trackes include `` wish you were here '' ( such an anthem nowadays ) , `` here in my room '' , `` made for tv movie '' ( a new favourite of mine ) & `` talk shows on mute '' . also very cool to see `` pantomine '' live , its also on the bonus cd , along with a couple live tracks & a couple of non-album tracks . im hoping to get to the leeds festival this summer ( if i can blag a ticket somehow ) so very much looking forward to seeing them even if it is only for an hour ! theyre the best band in the world in my opinion . basically buy this if you love incubus , its the best dvd you can get of them ...
