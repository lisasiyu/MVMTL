wow , i think it 's worth buying ! ! ! i bought this season coupple of days ago , and wow , is all i haver to say . it seems like the shows are longer , better acting ( well some scence ) , and i like the scenes where they had edited them in the tv broadcast . if you are a knight rider fan like mylself , then this should be in your collection ! !
