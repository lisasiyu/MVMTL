where 's boris ? the only reason i knocked off a star is , i was disappointed that in a couple of the movies , boris is hardly in them . it is really stretching to include them as a collection of his movies . other than that , the quality is first rate . and i was glad they gave us three discs , instead of one double-sided one , like they have done in the past . i do n't know if universal did n't have more in their library to choose from , but it is painfully obvious in the black castle , that boris and lon are just making cameos to try market it as a horror movie .
