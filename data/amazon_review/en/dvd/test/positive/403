old-fashioned sci-fi movie at its best i sound like an old man when i say that there are movies back in the day that are better than the slickest modern production , even when the movies outdate me . maybe because today 's filmmakers are so much in love with cgi effects that they feel they can replace little , unimportant things like plot , storyline and character development . that 's why i 've steadfastly refused to see spielberg 's version of this classic ; i do n't want anything to tarnish my memory of what i consider , as a kid growing up and today , one of the best sci-fi films ever made . folks hold up `` forbidden planet '' as the quintiscencial science fiction film of all time , and while i 'd never quibble with other people 's opinion , i believe this movie gives that one a serious run for its money . first of all , for its relatively short running time , we are given everything that i mentioned earlier , and it does n't feel rushed . purists complain that there were too many changes to the source material , but period films are period films , at least according to the thought of that time , and sci-fi is sci-fi . to stage a '50s film adaptation of h.g . wells actually in victorian england would 've been a bit much for the audience seeing it in a cinema . the changes , once you get settled into the story , are really minor , and actually help add to the enjoyment of the movie . and they do add breadth to `` war of the worlds , '' for we see glimpses of how the rest of the world is faring with the martian invasion . other countries get their collective butts kicked , and we see it happen live . we see the failure of a purely military solution to a lifeform that has superior technology and not the least bit of concern for the other beings already on their new home . is it a metaphor for the `` red menace '' mentality of the time ? a little bit , but there 's also a hint that , for all the power the u.s. armed forces has , simple military solutions are n't going to cut it . in its way , this movie is more progressive in `` political '' tone than others of its time or type . finally , we have the special effects , which actually hold up well to the effects of today . yep , digital transfers , done well , allow us to see the wires and supports holding up spaceships , and somehow that alien arm just seems ... .cheezy , when compared to what 's possible with today 's techniques and budgets , but they knew how to use what they had . more importantly , they knew what to show and what not to show . the aliens themselves were troublesome and balky , not to mention they had the habit of falling apart when moved too much , so we were left with mostly our imagination as the filmmakers used shadow , music , and brief glimpses of the martians ' technology , bodies , and hands to create the horror they wanted us to feel . their techniques worked then , and they still work today . so , what can be said of a movie that 's really `` timeless ? '' compare some of hollywood 's most lavish productions in recent years to a movie made when special effects really had to be slaved over , and `` war of the worlds '' tops out every single time
