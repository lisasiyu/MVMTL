a true artist one of my all time favorite movies . what a great documantary and story of a very complicated man and his effect on such a vast multitude of people of all levels and across the world . and then his families , and the son who tells the story and his journey and questions , you can feel how he 's attempting to grapple with all that he discovers , that inspired me . awesome footage , and quirky interviews with some of the legendary architects of our day . amazing job for the documentor and how he has put such a complex story together in such a simple style without over-simplifying the stories
