stick with it losey 's `` the servant '' is a film you really have to stick with in order to get to the meat and potatoes . it 's almost like two movies in one . it opens up innocently enough , with dirk bogarde ( hugo ) coming to playboy tony 's ( james fox in a performance that oscillates between being mind numbingly annoying to heart rendingly pitiable ) house , offering to be his servant . from there it will take the viewer awhile to understand just how sinister and depraved bogarde 's hugo is -- for a good part of the film he just seems to be a confused , buffoonish servant trying to do his job . from there things get really , really sick . co-dependency , class struggle , loneliness , alcoholism and finally madness dominate the house as bogarde accomplishes a slick mastery of tony 's psyche and then his life . he gets the weak minded and wealthy playboy to cheat on his fiancee , and then takes advantage of the ruins his life is left in afterward . by the end of the film you know everything is screwed in a royal ( no pun intended ) way . sickness and betrayal crawl from every frame of the last half an hour , and the transformation the film undergoes is unbelievably well done . you really do n't know who to sympathize with , since the only character with a single intent and purpose is tony 's fiancee who quickly flees when the situation essentially becomes an orgy of broken minds and hearts . this as good and creepily understated a film as alfred hitchcock ever made . a must see .
