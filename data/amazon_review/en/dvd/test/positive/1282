a movie that echoes the great thing about this movie is just how believable it is . some people i have shown it to actually thought that eddie and cruisers were a real band and that the movie was a docudrama . the characters have faults and failings and are believable , the plot is classic rock'n'roll mythology , the music is original ( mostly ) and great . john cafferty and the beaver brown band provide the real voice of eddie wilson and these guys can really rock . this soundtrack rates in my top 50 favorite albums to this day . `` what i want is songs that echo '' says eddie , and oh and they do . both score and movie are still fresh and relevent today . the only rock'n'roll movie i like better is eddie lives ! ( out now ) together they tell one of the best r'n'r myths ever . get both now !
