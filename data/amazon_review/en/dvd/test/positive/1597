the batman i am going to give the batman , season 3 , a rating of 4 stars , based primarily on the continuing improvement seen in seasons one and two with respect to certain aspects of the original batman-the animated series , but downgraded from the five star seasons one and two , due to increasing reliance on robin and batgirl . because of the obvious confusion in the series titles , i will refer to the batman animated series from the 1990 's as batman-the animated series and i will refer to the current one as the batman . i own and have viewed all four editions of the original 1990 's animated classic , batman -- the animated series and like many , at first i was somewhat put off by the batman 's new animation style . batman-the animated series was groundbreaking in many ways and had an original look and feel . nevertheless , this new version grows on you and there is much of value here , indeed , some things here are even superior to batman-the animated series . the animation style here has overtones of the japanese anime style but nowhere near as much as has been incorporated into the cartoon network 's teen titans , whose look i detest . in fact , given the tragedies of the look of the teen titans and the recent computer animations done of the fantastic four on the cartoon network , and spider-man on mtv , the batman looks traditional and sensational by comparison . furthermore , for me , the batman in batman-the animated series was drawn too much with a brawny space ghost/gothic look , inspired by frank miller and the first batman movie from 1989 . the costume in batman-the animated series returned to the original batman costume with all dark tones , from the 1940 's . if you are in your 30 's or 40 's as i am , this is not what the batman that we grew up with looked like . the 1970 's batman generally was leaner and more athletic looking , and had the costume that i prefer , with the round yellow bat insignia . the batman retains this classic 1970 's look . the premise of the batman is that this is the batman in his early years of crimefighting , and accounting for his youth , i believe that the overall look here is more consistent with the way batman was drawn in the 70 's by adams , giordano , rogers and others , perhaps in order to fit more with the new batman of the movie , batman begins . at least in the first two seasons of the batman , this batman is both a loner who works by himself , and a vigilante sought by the police . i find this more realistic than having , as in batman-the animated series , the police essentially deputize batman and having batman fight crime with child sidekicks -- although robin and batgirl are to come in this series as well . the other thing that i am beginning to really like about this series is the fresh look at many of the villains that it is taking . the joker is still recognizably the joker -- i asked my three-year-old sons to verify this -- but he has a different and bizarre look . the same is truth for many of the other stalwarts : the riddler , the penguin , poison ivy , catwoman , etc . like its predecessor , the batman continues with the annoying trait of far too many joker episodes -- really , ca n't they improve security at arkham asylum at all ? -- as well as too many of the other before-mentioned villains who are beginning to become a bit tired . i would prefer to see more of the lesser-used villains like ras and the scarecrow . it does , however , have some excellent episodes involving killer croc , man-bat , and solomon grundy and another involving the bane defeat of batman . hopefully , we will continue to see more of these lesser known but more interesting opponents . one thing that i have never really understood about dc is their general refusal to use famous comic book story arcs in their movies and cartoons . when it is done , as with the ras story from batman-the animated series , the results can be excellent . marvel does this much more often , to great success but dc seems to almost always try new and inferior stories . overall , i find the batman less stilted and more in line with the classic dc comics batman of the 70 's , in terms of tone , darkness and style , compared with the more self-important , taciturn and somewhat bland batman in batman-the animated series . the reason that i only give it 4 stars instead of 5 , is that the creators are currently going down the same road as their predecessors at the animated series and that means that the episodes are incorporating more and more robin , which is arguable on the merits , and more and more of batgirl , which is not arguable on the merits and is apt to ruin the series . batgirl was never an essential part of the batman comic , unlike robin and her inclusion here is lamentable . i have heard the dc creative talent say that anytime you do a batman show , that you get two years to do it right and then the suits at warner brothers come over and start asking , `` where 's robin ? -- where 's batgirl ? -- we need the youth market . '' the first two years i would give 5 stars to each . time will tell where this series goes from here . in my opinion , the first two seasons of the batman were the best comic book adaptation currently going , with the possible exception of the justice league , which is now out of production . i am hoping that the future of the batman has some more famous comic book story arcs involving ras , scarecrow , or man-bat , but i fear that lots of the joker , penguin and batgirl are in the offing . time will tell . if you are a traditional batman fan , i wholeheartedly recommend seasons one and two and the third season , somewhat less
