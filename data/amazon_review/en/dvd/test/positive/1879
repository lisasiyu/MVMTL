pleasant performances , & quot ; charming & quot ; film in the early 19th century , a woman in foreign garb is found walking the english countryside . her language is a mystery . is she the lost princess of south pacific island , a lunatic , or someone else entirely ? this is the central question of princess caraboo , whose title character is wonderfully played by the alternatively child-like and proud phoebe cates . kevin kline and john lithgow deliver very funny performances as , respectively , the suspicious greek butler of the family that & quot ; adopts & quot ; caraboo and a professor called in to determine whether she 's a fraud . through it all , stephen rea provides a quiet , consistent presence as a journalist fascinated by caraboo 's story , whatever it may really be ( though rea 's hair is disturbingly similar to richard simmons ' here ) . this is a good rental film , filled both with these performances and gorgeous scenes of the english countryside . and it is not without a relevant message : do we not hope that those around us may turn out to be more than they seem , so that we may either profit by our association with them or , if they turn out to be infamous , come out looking superior ? a pleasant 4-star diversion
