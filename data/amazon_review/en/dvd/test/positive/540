i wish i could give this movie a 6 rating , it 's the best theatrical biography i have ever seen ! i loved everything about this movie . it captured the spirit of gandhi 's life , had a well developed plot , great characters , beautiful scenery , wonderful music and was a fine example of great drama . it did n't sensationalize gandhi , his life , his impact on the world or rely on a lot of hollywood gimmicks for its strong visceral impact . this is the best theatrical biography i have ever seen and it is possibly my favorite movie of all time . it is truly inspirational and raises the bar for this type of movie considerably . in short , it is a masterpiece
