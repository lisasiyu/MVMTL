'70s noir this is a relatively unknown film noir from the mid '70s , starring gene hackman as a former football player turned private eye who is obsessed by a chess game from the '20s , where one of the players missed a forced mate , and lost instead . he 's hired by a wealthy former hollywood starlet to track down her daughter , which takes him to some of the seedier parts of the florida keys you 'll ever see on film . as is common in other noirs , just about everyone in this film is corrupt , even including hackman 's character himself , to a certain point . as noted by another reviewer , this movie will remind many of 'chinatown ' . in the end , just about everyone loses . i have a copy of this on vhs , and i bought the dvd for the widescreen . i was impressed by the image quality of the dvd -- it 's a little grainy , but overall , quite high quality . i do n't think anyone 's going to be very disappointed by the transfer , considering it 's a mid '70s film . the only extras are some trailers , and a sort of short documentary on the director . hackman is terrific in this , as he is in most of his other films . he can play genial one moment , and a moment later play cynical and tough . it 's too bad he did n't get another opportunity at another role like this . unfortunately , they do n't really make films like this anymore
