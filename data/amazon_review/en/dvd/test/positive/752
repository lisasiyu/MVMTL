i love gene kelly ! i grew up with gene kelly performances and so this box set is wonderful . `` singin ' on the rain '' is one of his classics , as well as one of his best performances . `` on the town '' and `` an american in paris '' are suberb too , highlighting kelly 's different strengths . i especially liked `` anatomy of a dancer '' though because it shed light on kelly 's life that i did not know . as such i grew to respect him and his work even more . i highly recommend it for gene kelly followers and musical lovers alike
