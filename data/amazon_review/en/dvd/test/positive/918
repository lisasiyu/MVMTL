the man who would be king this is one of the best adventure films i have ever seen . wonderous , full of humor and action . great performances of sean connery and michael caine . and all that before the golden age of special ( computer generated ) effects . a masterpiece which i never tire of seeing . and every time the ending makes me feel a bit sad and feeling sorry for daniel and peachy . they deserve better .
