propaganda , but very well done . dziga vertov 's film is an amazing and quite daring foray into the realm of experimental cinema ( i say this with some reservations -- see below ) . the viewer is quite literally transported to the soviet union of the past . we witness love and loss , happiness and sadness , life and death . we witness the beginning of a day and the end of a day , a wedding and a divorce , a birth and a funeral . all the scenes are real -- the birth is a real birth , the funeral a real funeral , the divorce a real divorce . nationalistic and cultural boundaries begin to fade since the events depicted say more about human nature than they do about a particular people . the music is quite inventive and amazing , especially when one considers that only three young men are performing it . the editing is some of the most astonishing ever to come out of soviet silent cinema . that said , there is a somewhat irritating political message that comes forth -- that industrialization will solve the problems of humanity , that those who follow the party line are the ones depicted as being sober and responsible . so many people are shocked by nazi propaganda films such as `` triumph of the will , '' -- i find it sad that more people are not troubled by soviet era films which tout the beauty of marxist-leninism while ignoring the carnage and sometimes outright genocide ( i.e . the ukranians ) carried out by the soviets for over seventy years . the fact of the matter is that soviet marxist-leninism slaughtered millions of people and enslaved millions of others . this is a troubling hunk of history that is difficult to ignore when watching this otherwise masterful work of filmmaking
