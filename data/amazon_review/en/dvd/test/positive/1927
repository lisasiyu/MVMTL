enjoyable backstager if you overlook the dreary hedy lamarr plot , there 's a lot to savor in this picture : garland 's singing , of course , which includes an early and very funny bit of self-parody when she belts the `` showstopper '' version of `` i 'm only chasing rainbows . '' note the look on garland 's face when papa/vaudeville veteran charles winninger orders her to `` give it all you 've got ! '' judy seems about to say , `` well , you asked for it ... '' my only disappointment is that she is assigned the negligible tune `` minnie from trinidad '' as her 11 o'clock number . lana turner 's performance as a gone-to-hell-in-a-handbasket showgirl/boozer . campiest moment in the film is when judy is assigned to keep lana sober ! lana 's final promenade down the stairs ( to yet one more reprise of `` you walked out of a dream '' ) is worth the price of the dvd -- this is what star quality is all about . there are also some very funny bits from edward everett horton and eve arden -- which made me wonder why la arden did n't turn up among all the other ladies in the women , lensing at metro about the same time as this pic . oh , and one other thing : do you notice that this film has almost the identical plot to valley of the dolls -- with lana in the neely o'hara part
