such an interesting documentary ! john cleese brings his signature brand of humor together with interesting and thought-provoking interviews to create such an interesting mini-series about the face - why is it beautiful ( or not ) ? what do expressions mean ? do they mean the same thing to everyone ? who is the best at knowing if people tell the truth - or if they lie ? what would life be like if you could n't recognize the faces of friends ? why are facial deformities so `` problematic '' for societies - is it because of their elevated importance of beauty , or is there a different reason ? this fascinating video will answer all these and more , leave you laughing ... and actually make you smarter by the time its over . support given by the undeniably beautiful and witty elizabeth hurley , funny man michael palin , and others round out the experience . i could n't recommend this movie more
