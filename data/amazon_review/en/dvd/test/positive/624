heartbreaking i 've seen this movie on tv a few years ago , but it just would n't leave my mind , so i ordered the dvd . it 's one of those movies you wo n't forget , because everyone of us has some kind of 'coach ' , as mitchell calls it . morrie is a great coach , and if you watch this movie , you will see why it is so heartbreaking . an old , wise man , a long lost friend , who teaches the last course in his life . at home . one student . a must have seen
