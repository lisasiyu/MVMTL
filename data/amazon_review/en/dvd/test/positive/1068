my favorite comedy movie of all time this homage to alfred hitchcock is a work of genius . the shower scene in this movie remains one of the best parodies ever . madeline kahn 's role is one of her best and cloris leachman looks as if she enjoyed playing her character . the casting in this movie is inspired .
