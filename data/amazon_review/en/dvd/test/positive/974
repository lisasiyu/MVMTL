suprisingly wicked and funny ... lots of twists and turns another good movie with rupert everett ... he simply has a good sense of humor that flows naturally in all the characters he portray especially in this movie . cate blanchett is spectacular . i would say , this movie has a very unpredictable and funny , some evil plot but not a boring story at all . my husband and i simply love this movie . he has to thank me over and over again for getting this for his valentine gift
