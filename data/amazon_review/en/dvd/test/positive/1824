spongebo never gets old i thought this one was hilarious my favorite episode was squrille jokes . spongebob does stand up at the krusty krab.his first few lokes were lousy so spongebob starts looking around for anything to make a joke about and he sees sandy the squrille and he makes fun of her so every one thinks she is dumb . i thought it was so funny . i think everyone should get this movie if there a spongebob fan . and adults if you think im not going to waste money on a talking sponge and listen to his kiddy jokes . well you should get it cause there is a lot of jokes that kids dont understand but adults do
