effective gothic style horror ( just my opinion ) i thought this is a really creepy movie and very hard to watch.it is filled with an air of dread and depression , but i managed to get through it.the last time i tried to watch it , i had to stop watching after 15 minutes.louise fletcher is terrifying as the wicked and evil grandmother.i thought the movie was very effective in the horror dept.it does n't go into as much depth as the book , but i think that would require at least a 2 part mini series.i would n't recommend it if you are feeling down.also , if you are a fan of the book , keep in mind that they left alot out of the movie.other than that , i would recommend it , especially if you like gothic style horror , which is what i think this movie is.for me , '' flowers in the attic gets a 3.5/
