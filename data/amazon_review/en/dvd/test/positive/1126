blown away good ! ok , so let 's talk about the music and the performance on this eagles concert hd-dvd . nothing but awesome ! just what i 'd expect from these boys . twenty-five , or so , songs , performed live with studio-quality sound perfection and singular performances by each and every member of this beloved american band ! the hd-dvd cinematography , lighting , and color is beautiful - almost better than being there . pretty much all of the songs you remember and love the eagles for ; ya know - hotel california , tequilla sunrise , take it easy , ... . etc . some new stuff as well . joe walsh sings a good new upbeat tune about zoning through his earlier life due to alcohol . lots of fun , big excited audience , great horn section , superb backup drummer , guitarist , keyboards . my only complaint is about the direction with respect to guitar playing - i really wanted to see more about how walsh and their other awesome guy ( do n't know his name ) made those awesome sounds . oh well . now , about hd-dvd players : i got the xbox 360 hd-dvd add-on . it was sub-standard , imo . i returned it and got the real deal toshiba stand-alone hd-dvd player with the independent analog audio inputs ( you 've got to get the analog surround inputs if you want to really experience hd-dvd sound on the recent toshiba players ) . so get real and get a dedicated hd-dvd player and check out those eagles ! i have a 100 '' screen front projection hd projector , 1200 watt pioneer sound box , and about $ 3000 worth of full size 7.1 surround speakers . it rally gets me in the `` zone . '' but you do n't need this much equipment to enjoy this great eagles hd-dvd - just a dedicated hd-dvd player . btw , if you love music , only the hd-dvd standard requires technically superior sound on each and every hd-dvd released - not so on blu-ray . so go hd-dvd
