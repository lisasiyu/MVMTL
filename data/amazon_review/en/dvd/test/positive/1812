a prophetic movie ? this low budget work of fiction from 1961 produced during the cold war era and blaming a shift in the earth 's axis on simultaneous atomic testing by russia and america leads to increasing enviornmental disasters of changes in weather patterns , increasingly violent storms of high wind damage , tornadoes , thick fog banks and stifling heat that keeps increasing to well over 100 degrees ! is this beginning to sound familiar ? this movie may be unintentionally the most prophetic movie ever made . disregard the sub plot of edward judd having marriage problems and you have a well written documentation of today 's weather changes with the unified suspicion that we are a doomed race . ours has not been by atomic fault , but may be due to increasing sun activity or perhaps , as this movie suggests , we are a little closer now . this science fiction scenario happens in about a month , for us it has taken years . yet , the power of the press , with real reporters unlike the news bunnies and manni-kens that report our news today dig to get the real facts from a government hiding the truth . why ca n't we get them also ? all inconvenient truths aside , will someone please stop this industrial baloney and tell the truth ? ! like the reporters in this picture , i really would like to know how much time is left before we burn up . get extra copies of this film to give to your friends . perhaps some smart fellow in hollywood will look into it and consider producing a more modern movie with the added elements of today 's conditions . all `` rocks from space '' movies aside , this probability has a greater implication for the future of the human race . a film of value , although today 's audience will be impatient by the slow pace and low volume conversations . despite this , it is still a film that can fill you with questions
