good but not as good as 1st 2 movies i like this movie the least of the mad max trilogy . anyways , several years after the events of `` the road warrior '' , `` mad '' max is still wandering the wastlands of the post-apocalyptic australia . he shows up at a `` semi-civilization '' called , bartertown . where through events that would take to long to describe , he ends up being forced to fight in a arena called , thunderdome . where he soon escapes ( creating alot of havoc for bartertown ) and escapes in to the desert . where he is found by a bunch of goonie-like kids , and they sorta annoy me.i wonder why they put them into it when mad max was based on car crashes rather than playschool.i know i will get people trying to tell me that scene was good , cause the kids acted well , but i thought it was crap.also it lacked his brilliant car , i know it got smashed up , but they coulda made it so he found another cool car . the script lacked punch i think.some of the acting was average . i remember being excited when they said this movie was being released , only to be disappointed because it simply does not match it with mad max 2 . but after seeing it quite a few times , i do enjoy it , but i just cant feel satisfied with it comparing it to the first 2 installments to this trio . but its still quite a good movie
