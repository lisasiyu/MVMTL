a suprising delight we rented this movie and watched it a dozen times with my kids ( ages 4-6 ) . we kept it well past the return date and now we will end up buying it on amazon . the kids are talented little actors and this was a nice movie for the family . i ca n't count the number of times that little chimp made my 4 year old twins giggle and cheer . great job
