stop the hatin reviewers/give it where its due i personally thought that stomp the yard was a great movie everything about it was great . it so sad to see that people can never give credit where it due . stomp the yard was a good movie i mean what more could you expect from the title . it did remind you of other movies like drumline , you got searved and maybe even step up but you cant look at those and expect to get the same thing out of it or even talk bad on because it wasnt what you wanted to be . to me the movie touched in to a little bit of everything romance , talent history , college and being new to something and showing what you got and also made a point about learning lessons . as far as the comment from betty burks i disagree with everything that was said because all of it was negative my advice would be to grow up and get up to dated we are no longer living in the old days so there was no need to compare the movie to people you felt like have already done things that ewere done in the movie . and the statment about violence come on where was that at i really missed that part and if i didnt and wasnt violence in the movie to state that comment itjust showed how some kids with talent react to certain situations a nick name is something that sticks with you and matches your personality or appearance if you didnt have one ... ..that just explains you the dances were more of a updated version of the latest dances the telescope comment wasnt called for amd and the noise you heard that was so loud was called surround sound its located in practically all movie theater please find something positive out of it atleast i give the movie 10starts its a must see film give credit where credit is due ! ! *********
