why all of anwr needs full nat'l wildlife refuge protection or more ; filmed with a touch of humor unfortunately , the 1002 lands at the northwest corner of the arctic national wildlife refuge do n't have this protection from possible oil drilling , in an area estimated to have oil reserves equal to less than six months of current needs . more unfortunately , the porcupine caribou herd does n't recognize that it is in potential huge danger by coming here to calve every year , as the cows have for time immemorial from this large herd . husband-and-wife heuer and allison gave themselves a belated honeymoon -- follow the herd from its winter grounds to calving area and back , all while documenting it . heuer has worked in national parks programs in canada and south africa and already done yeoman environmental work by hiking the entire yellowstone-to-yukon or y2y corridor to popularize the need for extended wildlife area protections for large mammals . the humor ? the movie starts with clips of george h.w . bush , followed by george w. bush , both saying that they ca n't see the need for caribou protection . so , heuer packs a `` w '' doll with him for the entire journey , so he can see just why the herd needs its calving grounds protected . an incredible journey through rugged land , fighting off cold and variety of incredibly ferocious flying insects , this is a fantastic wildlife effort . pair it with heuer 's book of the same name , and you 'll fall in love with the herd too
