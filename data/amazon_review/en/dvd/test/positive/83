it was worth the money ! i had previously bought the 1st version . liked it very much . so i was eagerly looking forward to this latest version . happy to know that this version has more new science related information - which was what i was interested in . and for those who want to just listen to the interviews with the scientist , there is a seperate section entirely on interviews . the best part is that they have re-interviewed the scientist and they explain more on what they have previuosly said and give more new informations . for those who have not seen the 1st version , i think it is alright to watch this . viewers are highly adviced to keep their mind open to all the information said in this movie . the interpretation and acceptance of the facts are up to the viewer . everyday more and more things are being discovered about our world , universe and what they are made of . if you had deep question about the reality , you might find an answer in this movie . -- ravi , singapor
