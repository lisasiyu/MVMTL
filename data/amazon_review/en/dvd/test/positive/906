enjoyable , but frankly my dear , id rather be in secaucus i managed to miss this : one of those generational impact movies , and never caught up to it until now . it is difficult to remember that all the cliches were not cliches when this movie was released , but i was able to watch it and just enjoy the crisp acting by all 8 stars . and of course there is that soundtrack . still , the movie ripped off `` the return of the secaucus 7 '' , and tho i havent seen that in a long time , my guess is id prefer it on a more core level
