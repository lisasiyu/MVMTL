`` smeggin ' awesome '' if seasons 1 and 2 of this fantasticly written , orginal series were good , season three is ... well , think of a good word for even better and plug it in . in the orginal first two seasons the gags were based mostly on dialouge . while they were still hysterical , season three can bost more action-based and even funnier gags , such as the killer-kebab . plus the dialouge is still up to its old standards , anything but shoddy . the only dissapointing thing about this season is that the actor who plays holly leaves ( i belive he quit because they were n't paying him as much as the others ) and is replaced by the actress who played `` hilly '' in the plaralell universe . i 'm sorry , but she just does n't have the same comedic air as the `` original holly '' . other than that , the show only gets better . and the trend continues with season four
