unexpected great find all of us over 40 types looking for a trip down memory lane with the likes of supercar ( mike mercury ) and fireball xl5 ( steve zodiac ) can take a more engaging trip with captain scarlet , which did n't air in the u.s . it 's like discovering a lost and forgotten series . ufo fans will recognize the voice of captain blue as ed bishop . it 's also somewhat uncanny that a show written 40 years ago about the mysterons `` war of nerves '' against mankind is not unlike the present-day threat of terrorism . unlike supercar and xl5 , people do die in this series , so small children might be disturbed . personally , i think this is the best series that anderson ever did ( sorry thunderbirds fans )
