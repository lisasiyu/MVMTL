teachers can use this realize that no one said this is `` real '' . it 's a movie about the future people . that being said , i teach high school biology and environmental science and i find this to be an excellent and entertaining dvd series . i use it to reinforce principles like : plate tectonics , climate patterns , adaptation , desert formation , biomes , eusocial insect societies , and especially , evolution . i could go on and on with the concepts that are applicable to this series . i have been using this series for 3 years now and i have yet to have a student complain about the series being boring or too `` fake '' . i have had many students ask if this is real , to which i have to remind students that it is set in the future and therefore the animals ca n't be real but the concepts are real . why is this applicable to teachers ? the dvds introduce fictional creaures , many of which are absolutely fantastic , and then procede to explain how the amazing things they have come up with are already around on earth right now , just in different forms . so the series really is about present animals as much as future animals . i use it in high school , but it is just as useful for middle school . please , if you are a science teacher , you owe it to yourself to see these dvds . when you see how good a teaching tool they can be , you 'll want to purchase these ( or get your school media center to purchase them ! ) .
