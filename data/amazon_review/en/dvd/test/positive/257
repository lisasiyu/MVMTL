worth watching braced myself when i rented this because i thought it was not going to be very funny - and i was pleasantly surprised . some parts of it were hilarious - michael richards ( kramer from seinfeld ) has a medium sized role and is as funny as ever . i was not dissapointed . it 's not sophisticated humor , but well worth it for the laughs . very enjoyable
