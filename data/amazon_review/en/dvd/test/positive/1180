the theme song was not changed this is in response to the concerns a couple people have raised about the theme song . in the original broadcast run the theme song was sung by studio singers for the first 10 or so episodes only . after that new vocals were recorded by johnny mathis and denise williams over the same backing tracks and their vocals were heard on all subsequent episodes . that is exactly what happens on these dvds . after episode 10 we get the mathis/williams recording on all the remaining episodes . i have all these early episodes on vhs recorded many years ago and the theme song - with both pairs of singers - is exactly the same
