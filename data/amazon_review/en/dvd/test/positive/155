ah , romance ! my family enjoyed goblet of fire -- my 12 year old said it was the scariest hp yet . i thought that the director did well to abridge the quidditch cup . we 've seen a lot of quidditch over the course of the earlier movies . they did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the bulgarian team . played nicely against teenage love was hagrid 's infatuation with the giant headmistress of beauxbatons -- a head taller than hagrid , if that 's possible . i think that emma watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast -- she 's growing up to be a beautiful young woman -- both my daughter and i thought her ball dress was stunning . ron and harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven hp movies , if they go that far . one thought i had about ms. rowling 's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of `` healthy '' competition . then again , she might just be telling a story .
