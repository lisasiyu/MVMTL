why why ? so i finished watching season 5 and let me tell you there are no words to describe how good the dialogue , the action , and the story arc was . please give this show a chance you will not regret it . yes , season 1 was slow but that 's how it is usually . afterwards , the show continues to grow . season 5 is probably my favorite because of spike and the storyline . i was pretty sad about fred . wesley is such an amazing character who becomes his own person on angel . i love what they did to him . this was worth all my money . please someone tell me a show out there rite now that beats angel and buffy . i mean the writing was sooo good this season how could wb even think to cancel this show ? now we will never see angel again ... booo wb !
