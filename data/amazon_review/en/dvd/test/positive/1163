the scene from john , raising lazarus ... this is a traditional telling of the life of jesus , from before his birth to the resurrection . the cinematography is breathtaking , the color , the costuming , the writing aided by carl sandberg is flawless and inspired and the scene of jesus weeping and then raising lazarus from the dead is awe inspiring . it was this scene which motivated me to write this review . rather than showing us a thunderous awakening from the dead within the tomb , stevens has jesus lift the hem of his toga and make the difficult climb up a rocky bluff , puffing all the way to the tomb on top of a hill . once there , jesus strikes a pose made popular by the style of ivan mestrovic and the french bronze sculptors of the mid twentieth century . when jesus reaches the high tomb , stevens and sandberg compose a masterpiece of prayer to the god of life before jesus calls out , `` lazarus ! come forth ! '' but in striking juxtaposition , stevens pulls back the camera , hundreds of feet from the tomb showing jesus , the son of the almighty , as a mere speck against the infinity of the countryside , let alone the universe , much as the fist fight between charlton heston and gregory peck in big country , shows the scale of man to god 's work . however , as jesus calls-out lazarus instead of seeing him rise , we see the wonderment , the bewilderment , the fear and love of men at the prospect of one man raising another from the abyss . we see in the crowd , as the camera dollies , rolls and scans , the faces of the believers , the unbelievers , the doubters and the ever faithful , their reactions to a man dead three days , reawakened by an act of god , brought forth by a human being , favored by god . how much more effective was this direction ? rather than a straw man of seeing the dead rise , we see instead how people like us would react to such a thing , the awe , the tears of joy , the fear , the love , the attempts to reconcile with reality , the unbelievable . there was no better way to show the spectacle and that scene alone is a must-see for an aspiring artist or film director . my only complaint about the film is a nitpicky one , jesus ' ( max von sydow ) hair is too short . if you believe , clap your hands , and even if you do n't , its worth the 199 minutes of your time . i saw the film with friends when it came out in 1965 and own the vhs and dvd , and watched it with a group , one of which was a self-proclaimed atheist-he had tears in his eyes at the lazarus scene . 4.75 star
