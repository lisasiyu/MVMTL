this is not the entire series ! i just figured i 'd get that out of the way . this is not the entire series as it seems most people are assuming . this is the complete collection part 1 . i 'm really not sure why it was done this way , but it is so i just want to make sure to avoid any confusion since there seems to be quite a bit . wolf 's rain is my single favorite anime to this day and i still watch it as much as anything else in my collection . it is the story of keba , hige , toboe , and tsume . they are wolves , a creature thought to have been hunted to extinction by humans 200 years ago . there is a legend that when mankind comes to an end , a paradise will decend upon the earth that only wolves will be able to attain . this is the background for the show as keba and the others meet and begin a long journey to find paradise . there are a lot of side stories thrown in to keep the viewer on edge including the wolf hunter tracking our heroes , two human scientists who eventually become caught up in the legend of wolves , and an evil empire that wants to open up paradise for their own evil intentions . eventually everything intertwines and creates the setting for one of the most powerful endings to any show i have ever seen . but in order to see the entire thing , you will either have to wait until the second half of this collection is released or buy the actual box set that does contain the entire series . either way you choose to do it , you ca n't go wrong with wolf 's rain
