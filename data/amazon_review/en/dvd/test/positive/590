the best in the breed when is comes to teacher/student dramas there is n't one better than 'mr . holland 's opus ' for the main reason that it 's believable . most of the films in this vein get trashed by critics for creating perfect teachers , teachers that can do no wrong . here , we get a glimpse into the life of a man whose intentions are all right but the outcome is n't always the best . he 's a man who knows how to do one thing , and that one thing he does so well , but that one thing is also what pulls him away from the one 's he loves the most . glenn holland ( richard dreyfuss in a career best ) is an aspiring composer who takes up teaching music to help pay the bills . his wife ( glenne headley ) is supportive , yet when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their deaf child things change . their relationship is tried as glenn starts to pull away from his family due to the fact that having a child who ca n't share his love of music is killing him . glenn is a very flawed man , but he has a very big heart and that 's why this film works so well . when glenn starts to fall in love with a student you do n't hate him as much as you feel bad for him . he 's far from a bad man , he 's just a man . this is truly one of the most touching , inspirational and blessed movies i 've ever seen . it 's a film that will never get old with me and will bring a tear to my eyes every time i watch it . with brilliant performances by the entire cast and a very true to life feel to the script and to the performances you feel as though you know these people , and by the end of the film you 'll want to . as ispirational as 2001 's 'a beautiful mind ' this film stands tall as one of the best films ever made
