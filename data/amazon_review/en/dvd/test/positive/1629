highly effective low budget chiller with great atmosphere and scary zombie characters the 1977 horror effort `` shock waves '' , has been a film i have long wanted to see . after my first screening of it i can say it most definately proves the adage that a film need not necessarily have a big budget to be highly effective in creating great atmosphere with heaps of tension and sheer horror . it 's story should prove irresistable to any horror lover with the visual image of sinister waterlogged nazi zombies rising out of their watery graves to terrorise unsuspecting holiday makers trapped on an island with a scarred former ss commander almost a guarantee of a tension filled viewing experience . i most certainly found it that way and was really surprised by just how effective this little effort was in creating just the right eerie effect . hopping on the undead zombie bandwagon `` shock waves '' , actually manages to rise above many of the cliches of this genrre which was so popular in the 1970 's . aided as it is by some truly superb under water photography , a creepy musical score which is highly effective in creating the great sense of unease and a really interesting cast including legendary horror greats peter cushing and john carradine , and former child star luke halpin , `` shock waves '' , has all the right ingredients for a highly enjoyable and at times quite disturbing horror story . partially based on the novel `` the morning of the magicians '' , the story opens with a dishevelled and disoriented young girl ( brooke adams ) being rescued from a dingy and it is her recollections of the horrific incidents she has just experienced told in flashback that make up the story . it seems she and a small group of holiday makers have taken a tour on a rundown old boat captained by a crusty old salt ( john carradine ) a nd his young assistant keith ( luke halpin ) . after experiencing some strange weather changes and what appear like underwater disturbances the ship collides in the middle of the night with a strange vessel that literally appears out of nowhere and does n't appear to have a crew . sustaining damage the tour boat runs a ground just off the beach of a strange island . when the captain mysteriously disappears keith takes the other passengers ashore in the dingy where they not only find the captain 's body but also find that the island is deserted except for a mysterious german gentleman ( peter cushing ) , who lives alone in an old hotel . it turns out he is a former ss commander of the nazi army who has fled to the island at the end of world war ii and he warns the trespassers to leave the island immediately . as it turns out he has his own secret in that he was in charge of a daring experiemnt by the german high command near the end of the war which saw the creation of a secret group of storm troopers called the death corps who were underwater breathing zombified killing machines designed to be unstoppable in battle and totally without mercy . unfortunately the underwater disturbances have upset the death corps watery grave in the hull of the boat that the commander had sunk them in after fleeing to the area at the end of the war and very soon they are coming ashore picking off one member of the group after another . the ss commander himself becomes their victim and soon it is only keith and rose ( brooke adams ) who are left and attempt to make their escape from the sadistic zombie killers . keith however does n't make it after fighting off the death corp members as they attacked the dingy just as they thought they were clear of danger and then it is just rose as the sole survivor who drifts away in the dingy awaiting to be rescued . `` shock waves '' which had a highly effective working title of `` death corps '' , was the brain child of independant filmmaker ken wiederhorn who was also the film 's writer/director and he along with producer reuben trane managed to work wonders on a very meagre budget of $ 300,000 . obtaining the services of horror greats john carradine and peter cushing was a definite plus and gave this low budget effort a status it might not have otherwise enjoyed . not much time is given towards deep character development as is usually the case in these type of efforts however both these acting greats make the most of their smallish parts . peter cushing in particular delivers his usual polished performance playing another variation on his nazi characterisation complete with hideous scar right down his face . he manages in a very short screen time to really create interest in his character and as to how a nazi ss commander happened to end up on this island all alone . performances by the rest of the cast are uniformily ok with younger members luke halpin who is still best remembered for his role in the highly successful television series `` flipper '' , and brooke adams in her major film debut being th emost prominent and doing good work in the face of the zombie onslaught . the really memorable participants in the story of course are the extremely sinister `` death corps '' or zombies that arise from the bottom of the ocean and begin an indiscriminate killing spree among those trapped on the island . their horrid appearance once again is a bit of a miracle considering the films low budget and it 's amazing how their google covered eyes , nazi uniforms , and blank unfeeling expressions give them a truly frightening appearance . the scenes of them slowly emerging from the water and creeping up behind some of the cast members are truly inspired pieces of filmmaking and go a long way to increasing the fear element in the story . a major plus in `` shock waves '' , considering that alot of the action takes place near water or actually in it , is the superb underwater photography by irving pare . his work here is excellent in firstly depicting the old submerged wreck that is home to the long dormant death corps and in the chilling shots of the zombies rising up and moving off along the ocean floor heading towards land . the location used in florida for the site of the island despite only being a few miles from greater miami has a suitably isolated feel to it and the sets used , whether they be the abandoned old hotel or the marshy swamps , possess a strange other worldly feel to them that really removes the story and the viewers from anything safe or identifiable . `` shock waves '' , although certainly no great horror classic is a most interestign effort that is now a firm part of my horror film library . it probably would be impossible to create such a film as `` shock waves '' , nowadays with such a low budget and be still able to include the performers , photgraphy and locations that it does . my only regret is that horror greats peter cushing and john carradine who are both great favourites of mine did n't get to have a bigger involvement in the story and actually share some screen time together . cushing 's character in particular is a most interesting one which deserved to have been explored more however that is a minor qualm and the overall product is excellent and essential viewing for anyone who has a fascination for `` zombie '' oriented stories or horror efforts in general . enjoy !
