innauguration of the pleasure dome a pleasure indeed if you 've seen the old mystic fire vhs of these films , you will be amazed at the quality of this dvd . innauguration is breathtakingly vivid . i have n't even been able to watch all of the films yet , only eaux d'artifice and innauguration , but i was so enthused by what i had seen that i could n't wait to get on here and praise it . ken is a visionary film maker in the most literal sense of the word . these films also come from an interesting milieu of individuals and circumstances and are important historical documents as well as lovely works of art . as a thelemite , i have long admired anger 's art and his dedication to promulgating aleister crowley 's teachings . yet his art , although rooted in a thelemic idiom , is not trapped by it , and it should appeal to anyone interested in the visual language of transcendence . i 'm already slavering for volume ii
