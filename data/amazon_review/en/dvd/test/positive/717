a great drama , with amazing depth 'good will hunting ' will always remain one of my favorite movies . it has an engaging storyline , great acting , and enormous emotional depth . it 's hard to believe matt damon and ben affleck were young college students when they concieved of this complex story . the story is about will hunting ( matt damon ) a troubled young man who is working as a night janitor at harvard university . he also happens to be a one-of-a-kind math genius , and catches the attention of award-winning math professor gerald lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) as he begins solving difficult math problems left on the blackboard . will , however , has no interest in pursuing a prestigious career in mathematics . he only reluctantly agrees to hold private lessons with the proffesor , being the only way to get out of jail after a spate of violence lands him there . part of his parole deal , however , is to meet with a therapist twice a week . after getting a couple of shrinks to give up on him , will finally lands with psychology teacher sean maguire ( robin williams ) who has a similar background as wills ' , hailing from the same tough neigborhood in south boston . as sean tries to get through to will emotionally , the professor tries to train will 's mind in advanced mathematics . all the while , will , who has had trouble maintaining a loving relationships due to his troubled past , begins to get seriously involved with a girl named skylar ( minnie driver ) . meanwhile , the professor and the psychiatrist , who 've had a rivalry of sorts back in their day , begin to quibble over what 's best for will 's future . filled with great profound dialouges and intense emotional scenes , it 's an immense emotinal experience . it obviously has very 'heavy ' subject-matter , and thus not an easy light watch , but it is very rewarding and entertaints throughout . it 's also a great buy because you will need repeated viewings to appreciate all its subtelties
