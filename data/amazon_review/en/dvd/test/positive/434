csi is the show to watch ! i was absolutely , hopelessly hooked on csi from the first time i watched it . i started with season 1 ( never saw it on t.v. , just started watching the dvds ) and am now on season three . this has to be one of the best cast shows out there -- the chemistry between the csis is amazing , the story lines are fresh , and it has quickly become my favorite drama ( with 24 being a very close second ) . only one thing about the other reviews -- yes , nick 's character is gorgeous , but how about that warrick ? he 's not what you might think of as movie star gorgeous , but there is something about him that is just absolutely amazing -- nice face , body -- everything . grissom is also attractive because he 's so intelligent and seems to know something about everything . sara has a great voice , and well i could say something great about all of the character 's physical qualities , but the most important thing is that the show is captivating , innovative , and fresh . season after season , you 're drawn into each and every story line . i love csi and hope it stays on the air for another 10 years
