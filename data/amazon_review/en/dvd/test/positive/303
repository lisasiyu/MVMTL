dinosaur longevity and scientific fact the first jurassic park was the best , but i still like some things about jurassic park iii better . the effects in 3 were improved , and being the public is used to seeing computer generated graphics in many movies since the first jurassic park 1993 , many cg movies have followed . titanic to come to mind , gladiator 2000 , godzilla 1998 , and many other computer graphic movies after 1993 . jurassic park iii had to convince the public even more that the dinosaurs in pt.3 were real . special effects expert stan winston and crew do an excellent job in doing that in pt.3 . the raptors look more authentic than in any of the first two jurassic movies . keep in mind that the dinosaurs in pt.3 and just like in the first two movies they were created with the aid of paleontologists , jurassic park dinosaurs with the help and knowledge of these paleontologists advised stan winston on the dinosaurs anatomic motions and even their growls and grunts , through their research and studies on dinosaur behavior . the special features on this dvd explain some of what i am discussing in this review . the thing i like about pt.3 is that it is a shorter movie than the first two . 30 to 40 min . shorter . the action is faster you get right into the movie . when you see sam niel blow into that replica raptor throat passage , what your really seeing is what paleontologists have done with molds taken from dinosaur skeletons mainly the head and throat . paleontologists have blown air into the molded cast and have produced what could have been dinosaur sounds produced many millions of years before the time of humans , incredible ! i am sure i am boring you with all this but i am trying to make you see the research that went into the special eefects of not only jurassic park iii , but in the first two . i enjoyed pt.3 immensly , shorter cut right to the action of the movie . this movie may have not been the best out of the three but it is better than pt ii . sam niel really played a believable paleontologists . amazing , this movie a third installment of the jurassic park franchise still made over $ 300.000.000 . i know the title jurassic park pt iii . and the special effects drew the people to this movie to make the over $ 300,000,000 it made at the box office , or maybe most people have a hidden fasination with seeing these dinosaurs come to life on the screen , because there really is nothing like these creatures alive today . jurassic park or not , dinosaurs are one of the most amazing success stories in the history of the earth they existed for about 160,000,000 to 180,000,000 years , modern humans only about 2,000,000 years so far . enjoy jurrasic park pt.3 for its researched special effects and fast paced action , no it will never be citizen kane but it will certainly entertain the whole family from the realists to the simple minded . remember alot of research went into jurassic park pt.iii , dont grade it for an oscar , grade it for the scientific research that went into it and the action and the fun . enough already enjoy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
