the blood of one 's brothers an almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film 's narrative , as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern movie-viewers , it is a dramatic technique at least as old as homer 's iliad and odyssey . what gods and generals shares with those ancient poetic balads is the celebration of the fighting man 's nobility , his rage , and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine . gods and generals sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout , the director 's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers . this nation 's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved . it was bound to raise its head in a union-threatening manner eventually . the events of 1861-1865 were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could . true , lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union 's preservation , but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place . the film follows the trajectory of general lee and - more prominently - virginia 's 'stonewall ' jackson . the latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led , not of himself . but his grateful men would have it no other way . 'stonewall jackson ' he would be from manassas on , and 'stonewall ' he would die . robert duvall , stephen lang , and jeff daniels do their characters proud , though it is perhaps duvall 's general lee who most rings true to the man 's decency , calm , and painful array of allegiances . mira sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the maine lieutenant coronel chamberlain 's wife , mrs. fanny chamberlain . 'war ' , one of the characters is early heard to say , 'is the sum of all evils ' and its reputed provocation by mr. lincoln 'a most dreadful mistake ' . the achievement of gods and generals is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men , who at times find fratricide thrust upon them , carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves . this film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the american republic , a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates , staining its streets , and drowning numbers of its finest
