`` no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity . '' `` but i know none , and therefore i am no beast . '' richard iii , act 1 , scene 2 francis dollarhyde has to be one of the more disturbing and chilling villains in modern day literature and cinema . abused and damaged as a child to a point where only a series of rudimentary , barely functioning social masks takes the place of a whole man , dollarhyde hides the savage pathology of a serial killer who annihilates entire families to fuel his twisted desire and impossible longing . although `` manhunter '' is less true to thomas harris ' book `` red dragon , '' and the 2002 film version with the same name , i found it to be a vastly superior film . despite its retro `80 's fashion and the distinctive pastels and sun-drenched look of michael mann 's work during his miami vice television series days , you will find a film that cuts through the meat , slicing through the bone and exposing the marrow . tom noonan 's performance has to be one of the most haunting and pitiable on celluloid . noonan delivers the tortured , damaged and ultimately unsalvageable soul of francis dollarhyde in a way that even harris ' book did n't convey . he is a howling soul in hell -- a grotesque who is driven by his delusions . william peterson is will graham , a former fbi profiler , who retired after a near death encounter in apprehending the notorious and now incarcerated hannibal lector ( played by a wonderfully sinister and reptilian brian cox ) . when graham 's former handler , jack crawford ( dennis farina ) , asks him to help him profile the murderer , graham visits lector in his jail cell , to recover the mind-set necessary to track the killer . in doing so , graham incurs lector 's wrath and his collusion with the very killer graham is pursuing , bringing him far closer to the case than he anticipated . joan allen absolutely shines as reba mcclane , the blind girl who has the misfortune to be attracted to francis dollarhyde and who unwittingly serves as dollarhyde 's last connection to his vanishing humanity . early on in their relationship , dollarhyde takes reba to a veterinarian who is set to cap a sedated tiger 's tooth . watching reba 's facial expressions as she ran her hands along the tiger 's fur and listened to the beating of its heart , with tears streaming down her face , was almost painful . dollarhyde watches her from a corner in the room and seems to experience something akin to an emotional release from her experience . it is one of the strangest and most erotically charged scenes i 've ever seen in a film . when i first saw this film in its theatrical release , i remember thinking , `` thanks a lot , michael mann , you 've totally ruined iron butterfly 's inna gadda de vida for me . now i 'm never going to be able to hear this great song from my youth without feeling vaguely frightened . '' even so , the sound track for the film contains some of the most eerily beautiful music from `80 's groups like red 7 , prime movers and shriekback , which mann has integrated flawlessly into the film . `` manhunter '' might annoy some viewers who remember only too well the big hair and bad fashion of the 1980 's . however , if you can manage to put these aside , i think you will find an often overlooked and intense gem of a thriller
