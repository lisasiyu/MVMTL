its a good action movie i was very keen on the early poseidon adventure which i liked . so i was keen to see what wolgang petersen , a director i do like , could do with the story . it found it to being a good movie . it did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next . so much so i lost track of time throughout the movie . having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort . in which case , i would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original . the characters are not so interesting nor is the acting . the story was better explained in the first one and more believable . the special effects are approximately as good . the filming however is better as the newer technology shows . still it is worth looking at .
