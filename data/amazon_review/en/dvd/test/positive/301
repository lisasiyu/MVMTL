`` i 'm a mean , green mutha from outer space ! '' this movie is freakin ' weird ! thankfully , i like weird . for the uninitiated , this is a musical about a man-eating plant ( voiced by levi stubbs of the four tops ) . it must be seen to be believed . our hero , seymour , discovers a never-before-seen plant , naming it audrey ii ( after his coworker and love interest , audrey ) . turns out , the plant eats humans , as he learns when it drinks his blood . at first , seymour befriends the plant , who helps him get around audrey 's boy friend , a sadistic dentist ( the song about him and pseudo-s & m scene that result are freakin ' hilarious ! ) eventually , things get out of hand - the plant 's uniqueness earns seymour much fame , even though nobody is aware of the plant 's dangers . when the plant eats seymour 's boss , things get out-of-hand , and the final battle between the two is hilarious also - levi stubbs offers his amazing pipes , declaring `` i 'm a mean , green mutha from outer space ! '' - one of my favorite movie quotes . this movie is a real side-splitter , and must be seen
