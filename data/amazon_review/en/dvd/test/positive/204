excellant for all ages but thanks kathy for tackling the menopause ! i 've worked out with kathy smith videos for years . i 'm about the same age as her and was delighted when she tackled the subject of the menopause . it is a very postive dvd and it made me feel empowered . i do work out regularly and found the cardio a bit too easy for me but will definately use it on days when i feel a bit tired . i would definately recommend this to beginners and intermediate exercisers of any age . the workouts are short and therefore easy to fit in when busy .
