rule of law determines whether a soldier is a barbarous or civilized defense argued , `` law does not exist in the confederate prison . therefore , the raiders are not guilty of breaking any law '' , `` these are desperate times and desperate measures are required to survive '' , `` only rebel law applies in the prison '' . outcries from other union soldiers were heard , `` we suffered the same hardships and did not yield to survival tactics . what about us ? '' prosecution deflected the rebel law argument by appealing to justice stating there were certain rights and protections guaranteed to all men : 1. protection against murder 2. protection against theft . the military jury found the six raider leader guilty and the punishment affixed as death by hanging . the union soldiers lived by law and law made the men civilized . mob rule only works while the majority tolerates the theft ; however , once intolerance levels are hit , a violent revolution transpires . the raiders could not fight the majority and probably would have all been murdered with out a trial . however , the majority gained their whit and requested and were granted a trial to prosecute the raiders . the `` great escape '' with mcqueen probably took its plot from andersonville . the story line had a ton of similarities . andersonville has a fair share of violence . at one point the directors portrays the prisoners as zoombies , in the land , of the walking dead . scurvy symptoms increased the graphic repulsiveness , in an attempt to balance the audience sympathy , abhorrence of the injustices , and despair of the troops . heroism abounds , leaders reject traitorous offers to defect , form their regiment , about face , and march away from on looking confederate admiral making offer . factually , 45,000 men were imprisoned and about 13,000 died from starvation , disease , and crime . inhuman treatment of prisoner included lack of drinkable water , over crowding of the prisoners , no prisoner exchange , and looting . andersonville has a fairly high entertainment value , as a civil war movie . the characters were passionate , compelling , and captivating .
