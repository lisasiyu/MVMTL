a clear understanding as to why enron fell i am a cpa & i watched the film in an ethics class we are required to take , essentially because of the fall of enron . i have since bought the video & watched it at least 5 other times . of course there are political slants . for example , they try & tie the bush administration ( s ) ( sr. & jr. ) to enron . but , the majority of the film deals with what happened to enron , so that in the end , the stock you purchased was worth $ 0 . i would highly recommend any person interested in business or the fraud aspect in business to watch this documentary . a riveting documentary on the rise & fall of enron & who the major players in enron were .
