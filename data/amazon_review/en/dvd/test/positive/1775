a delight i highly enjoyed this movie . all the way through i was entertained by the story and involved in the lives of the characters . unless there were some swear words i missed i have no idea why it got an r rating . there were a few sex scenes none of which showed much skin . i would cry 'double-standard , ' but what 's the use ? anyway , this movie is definitely worth your time .
