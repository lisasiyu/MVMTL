the world 's greatest dance show all i can say is that if there is anyone who does n't love this show after seeing it than we do n't live on the same planet . this show inspired me to take irish dancing . now i 've worked my way up to going to the world championships next year ! in other words , it 's a masterpeice . personally i would give this 10 stars . there just is no comparison
