no soldiers , no war this is a great movie that won best picture in 1987 and was acclaimed by both the public and the critic . oliver stone directs his first movie about vietnam ( the second was `` born on the fourth of july '' , another great movie ) telling his own experience about going to war . from the very beginning we can see everything about the military that they do n't show when they recruiting ( the ugly and painful true about the war ) . and the movie goes on an on until you see absolutely everybody completely nuts , doing drugs , killing randomly , even killing each other . this is waht war does with men . you are not a human being anymore . the movie is obviously rated r for violence , and there are some very tough scenes that make anybody cry . the toughest in my opinion is the one at the village , when they kill -among others- a mentally retarded ( and of course harmless ) young guy , and a woman . then they set the village on fire , rape some women , and get away with it . the whole cast is excellent , specially dafoe , who in my opinion nails his character . and the dvd comes with an excellent and terrific documentary called `` tour of the inferno '' ( about 30 minutes long ) about the film with stone , dafoe , depp , etc . talking about the movie . there is also a commentary by stone and a captain in there . this movie should be mandatory in all high schools in america . if there were no soldiers , there would be no wars , and the war in iraq looks a lot like the war in vietnam . usa is making the same mistake again , and the government is so blind to see that ( or maybe they do n't care about the people , just about the business all the weapons ' companies -bush ' frieds- are making out of it ! ) . but let 's be smart , let 's just ignore the government . they always get their way . let 's be smart and close all rotc programs from schools . how can we be so hypocrites and have those programs in schools ? is that the education we really think our children deserve ? that does not happen any other place in the world , not even in cuba . let 's invest that money on education . real education . how many trilion dollars have bush wasted in iraq so far ? how much money does the government invest on education ? on health ? for the people who live and work in america ? parents : teach your children . nobody should join the army . let the politicians -real leaders , not the bunch of idiots we have today spread all over the planet- do the job , we 'll see how many would go . let the commander in chief go to war himself . there is no question about it : there would be no war . they would n't go . they would try to negotiate , and try to solve conflicts peacefully . again , this is a great movie everybody should watch . a masterpiece that is just not that , but also makes us think , and educates us . everybody should ask themselves : war ... is it worth it ? what for ...
