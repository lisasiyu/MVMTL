a treasure returned to the catalogue to the best of my knowledge , this is the first dvd featuring renata scotto although i would be delighted to be proved wrong ( please reissue a tokyo lucia with bergonzi ) . the only other dvd ( with june anderson ) is hardly in the same league so perhaps i should have rated it five stars ! my only negative is the very dated production ; it clearly shows its age , especially aesthetically although i would be hard put to suggest how it should be staged . suffice it to say that it works and with scotto and domingo the emphasis is clearly on the singing and they deliver in spades . it is ironic that verdi did n't give his title soprano an aria that had been excerpted and sung by sopranos of the past whereas the tenor has the glorious aria that has be recorded countless times in the days of 78 's and lp recitals . needless to say domingo garners the greatest ovation . milnes was clearly an audience favorite ( if not one of mine ) and there is no doubting his committment to the role both in his aria and the wonderful duets with scotto . it is somewhat ironic that milnes and domingo are roughly contemporaries while domingo continues to sing ( albeit a reduced and different repertory ) and milnes career started to fade a number of years ago . ordinarily baritones can enjoy longer careers than tenors , but in this case ... .. scotto is a treasure ; the dvd should be required viewing and studying for any one who aspires to the repertoire . it was late in her career yet she is savvy enough to know how to capitalize on her strengths and minimize the weaknesses . her attention to text is an object lesson and of course it helps that she is italian , but she animates every phrase she sings , does nothing that is superfluous . i saw her only once , a butterfly in san francisco in the 70 's ; it was a glorious performance . but then she is a glorious artist
