great film - fox lorber version ... . at least it 's cheap ophuls is a master film maker and watching lola montes is to watch what movies at their best are capable of . that said , i am interested to know what happened to the missing segments of this film - you always hear about it being cut callously - but i am not sure whether the original film still exists ... anyway , see the movie despite inferior versions
