tales from echo park at the end of my review of director/writers richard glatzer and wash westmoreland 's first nationally distributed film , i wondered aloud as to what these talented , quirky guys would do after the fun , i only steal from the very best movies take on the gay porn industry and the hangers-on that populate it , '' the fluffer . '' well now i know : it 's the very human , thoughtful and real `` quinceanera . '' shot in a section of los angeles just 10 minutes from where i live yet on many levels worlds apart socially and ethnically , and reeling and rocking from the mixture of mexican-americans , who have lived there for many years and the upscale interlopers in the form of non/mexican americans who go to echo park looking for homes that they can afford now that the westside of los angeles is way beyond most peoples means . glazer/westmoreland 's take on this cultural and monetary disparity is to step back , aim the camera and refuse to take sides : both the inhabitants and the interlopers are examined carefully and without judgment . the central story involves the impending quinceanera ( a sort of bat mitzvah ) of magdalena ( a strong , fiery emily rios ) , her `` miracle '' pregnancy and carlos ( an angry , intelligent jesse garcia ) who happens to be gay which does not sit well with his father who promptly ejects carlos from his home : both mag and carlos find acceptance and love with their great uncle tomas ... the emotional center of his family and of this film , chalo gonzalez . `` quinceanera '' is not a perfect film : the flaccid editing hurts the last third of the film but despite this , few film scenes have as much emotional power and pack such a wallop as carlos 's ( and therefore , of course , jesse garcia 's ) eulogy at tomas ' grave-site , in front of a family that mostly despises him because he is gay : it is on the one hand brave and on the other as heartbreaking and emotionally open and naked a scene as any committed to film in a long , long time .
