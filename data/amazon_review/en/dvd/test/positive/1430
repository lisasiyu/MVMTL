amusing caper `` the assassination bureau '' has an amusing premise and for the most part executes it ably enough . oliver reed stars as the head of a consortium of international assassins who takes on an interesting assignment . crusading reporter diana rigg contracts his organization to kill him . reed takes up this proposal because he feels that it will enable him to weed out the weaknesses in the organization . assistant chairman telly savalas has other ideas , however . the film starts off well enough , has kind of a clunky midsection . this portion of the film feels more slapsticky than darkly comic . the film recovers and delivers a slam-bang ending . oliver reed is charismatically suave as ivan , the head of the bureau . savalas and curt jurgens as a german associate are sublimely villainous . diana rigg , however , is n't given much to do as miss winters . the high point for her in this film is a scene where she is required to walk around in a bath towel . not classic comedy but not a bad way to wile away a few hours
