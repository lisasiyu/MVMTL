why we need birth control ... i think this movie , although depressing , was a good example of the survival instinct manifested in children . maybe in some sort of perverted way i thought that these children would become expert in the ways of survival , and that this experience could be a positive in their lives as they got older . these kids were being knoked around early in life and this , hopefully , would only make them stronger granting them a true picture of reality and the dog eat dog lifestyle of capitalism . these kids are a model for the capitalist system that encourages a rugged darwinian individualism . a part of me wishes that i would have spent a few years on the street like these kids ( sans the aurolac if possible ) . if anything we should admire these children for their incredible innocent strength ... this is urban primitivism and liberty at its best especially when contrasted with those fat and ugly pampered bucharetians chillin ' at sydney 's cafe ...
