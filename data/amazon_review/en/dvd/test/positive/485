i felt like a beginner ! i had been working out on a stability for about 6 months and i thought this would be a change of pace for me and figured being a `` beginner '' workout i would n't have a problem . boy was i wrong ! i felt like a true beginner as i worked through the routine and was wobbling all over . regardless , i still `` felt '' the results of the workout . it took me several repetitions to start to control myself on the ball and feel like i was actually mastering the moves . this routine now has a permenant place in my exercise rotation and i love all that i 'm able to do . do n't be scared away . stick to it and you 'll love the way it makes you feel and the results you 'll get
