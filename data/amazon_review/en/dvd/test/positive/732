it 's a entertaining film but not everyone can embrace sincity . sin city was n't really the type of film that everyone would appreciate , one must remember this film comes right out a comic book , i love bruce willis is like one of my favorite actors and he had the perfect voice to do the story telling , his character role was let 's say typical bruce , it can be considered a simple story with a light twist , the plot was reasonable and all in all enjoyable at least for me , i say it 's worth a watch laterz folks .
