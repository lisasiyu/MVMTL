for every nerd with dreams of grandeur i found this series especially delightful because robson green 's character lives within the confines of his own mind . though he shows remarkable insight into the actions of the violent and deranged , he also displays that phenomenal lack of social consciousness that is particular to geniuses and artists ( as in & quot ; yes , i just invented nuclear fission , but no , i did n't know i was supposed to wear socks and shoes to this award ceremony. & quot ; ) . this makes for some truly unusual and amusing situations , that help bring levity to the gruesome crimes he investigates . if you like touching evil or monk , this series may be for you .
