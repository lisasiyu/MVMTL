the real evil dead no other movie has ever become such a booming sense of reality to my life than the evil dead movie/s.. bruce campbell is one if not my favourite actor and enjoy all his movies.. this edition is great for the commentaries on it and the extra features including bruce 's little doco on fans ... a must have for all fans ! ! ! ! i am scared they are thinking of remaking this fantastic movie and i just hope mr. rami will realize this is a mistake ... 'ash ' rules ! !
