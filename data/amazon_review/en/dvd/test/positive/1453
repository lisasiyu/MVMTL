marie windsor-the killing-wow ! director stanley kubrick 's first `` major '' film was this vastly entertaining noir , '' the killing '' , dealing with the robbery of a northern california race track engineered by ex-con sterling hayden. ( great ! ) his `` gang '' includes such character actor stan-outs as jay c.fliipen , joe sawyer , ted decorsia , as a dishonest cop , timothy carey ( as a sniper ) , and the noir immortal elisha cook , jr . ( the maltese falcon , the big sleep ) and as cook 's ultra-sexy and heart not made of gold wife marie windsor.miss windsor could play roles such as these with her eyes closed , but you will never close your eyes while marie is on screen , mainly in her beautifully alluring lingerie , which she wares most spectacularly . marie is great as cook 's disguisted wife , who pours out her vemomous insults toward 's her little georgie non stop and without remorse.naturally , she is not ( sexually and otherwise ) satisified with george so she has a younger boyfriend on the side , played by a youthful vince edwards.the plans for the heist are all hush/hush , but george in order in impress sherry ( mw ) spills some of the details of the planned robbery.sherry , who desperately wants out of her dead end marriage has a little surprise for georgie and the gang after the robbery is completed but she needs her boyfriend 's help , needless to say one seductive glance by marie and edwards is hooked.so when part of the gang meets to split the heist money , hayden is late , the surprise will take place.the robbery goes ok , but the afterword is where all hell breaks lose ! kubrick 's direction is swift and the story told mainly in flashbacks moves right along , at a fast pace.the film is only eighty minutes.sterling hayden , who at one time i could not stand as an actor ( i was a kid when i thought that way ) gives his greatest performance to date , only to be topped by his role in dr.strangelove ( also directed by kubrick ) , and in the first godfather film , as a dishonest irish police inspector.coleen gray as hayden 's loyal girlfriend is fine , i believe here career should have been more productive , as she should have been given better roles.she her in red river , as wayne 's girlfriend , and as ty power 's naive wife in the noir classic `` nightmare alley '' .but this is marie windsor 's show and she runs away with it ! if you love noir you will love this film !
