the drama of war is played out by the young.. this is my favourite movie , and the cinematography and music are amazing . in addition the various themes of belonging , loss , betrayal , and love , there is the fact that all these characters caught up in the war are so young . the disfigured caravaggio , the naive and delightful hana , the sikh who defuses bombs ... they are all young people who are still adjusting to the fact that life does n't always give you what you want - less so during times of war . we even see how young the english patient is during flashbacks , though he looks older and seems wiser since his experiences of physical and emotional loss . he knows he 's dying , but everyone around him is also aware that they too , could die at any time ; that 's not something that young people usually think about on a regular basis . it is a beautiful film . it is also a deep film that reveals how different people respond to the fact that they could die any day
