like an old friend that i have n't seen in a while i have seasons 1 & 2 , & could n't wait for the next installment . this was my favorite show when i was a kid . it feels like i grew up with these girls & mrs. garrett was the wise grandma i never had . alot of the episodes now play like those old after-school specials , but i just ca n't resist going back to a more innocent , light-hearted time . it definitely gets nostalgia points & will make you smile
