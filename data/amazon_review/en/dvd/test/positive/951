an enlightening and mesmerizing film ! this is a good movie with comments to make on many levels . it shows the heartache that one couple has to overcome after losing a child . there is a certain poetic justice about the stupidity of a nanny putting herself in jeopardy , a pleasant , caring woman who has been breaking the law for 16 years . then there is the story of two boys who play their rifle games oblivious to what harm they are doing to other people , completely innocent people . does their culture create people , even young ones , who are so irresponsible ? today 's newspapers confirm the film 's answer . . a resounding yes . and , attached to the film 's plot by a very slender thread , the japanese girl has pain that can be felt by everyone watching her , including the audience . i would n't necessarily call this film enjoyable , but it is an enlightening and mesmerizing film . it also has probably the best role that brad pitt has ever had or played .
