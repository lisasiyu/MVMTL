i love almodovar i ca n't say it any other way . as one critic once , almodovar does n't just make movies . he is the movies ! in the light of that , he deserves his own box set . while not a complete box set of his works inclusive , this does feature a pretty good cross section of early works & recent works which confirm that almodovar is indeed a film-making genius in every sense of the word . let me also mention law of desire & matador have never been available in dvd format here in north america prior to the release of this box . it may be a shame , however , for some customers to buy this box set if they already own all the other films in the package aside from those two . on the other hand , this is a great find for many as virtually all of the films here are now very difficult to find & some are currently out of print . fortunately , i only owned bad education & talk to her on dvd before this was released so i did n't lose very much by purchasing the entire box . as far as the plots or storylines go , i think it 's fair to say the critics have already done a fantastic job so i will skip the film introductions here . i can also safely assume all of us who are shopping for almodovar films know pretty much what to expect whether it be controversy , heartfelt stories , or madcap humor . if the gods of celluloid cinema would find it in their hearts to release another box set , i would surely appreciate it as there are four more films of almodovar that are either out of print or never released in the states on dvd which would make nice gifts or great collector 's items as well . in the meantime , i 'm quite sure we are all atleast marginally pleased with the box we 've received . the box itself is quite attractive featuring nice artwork all-around , lobby cards including orignal artwork for every film included here , & a bonus disc with special features sure to please every die-hard fan . there are no individual cases for the films here but they are fastened relatively tight by spindles which tend to overlap a bit . i had initally feared that the individual discs could become dislodged in transit causing damage or scratches but everything was in it 's proper place . most of the discs themselves do n't offer much in the line of extras so they are basically standard issues with the usual subtitles , menu , & chapters . overall the quality of each movie is very good but not great . in fact , some of the discs are only a tad better quality than the old vhs tapes which are hard to find these days as well . but again , i 'm just greatful that these films are readily available so the overall picture quality may be jsut small potatoes as far as i 'm concerned . nearly all the films here are deserving of the five star rating i 've supplied even though i ca n't say that bad education was my all-time favorite . for some reason or another , i thought this was a bit too dark & i was hoping for a bit more madcap humor or warmth which almodovar is known for . nevertheless , almodovar did an excellent job & gael garcia bernal was phenomenal making bad education a worthy film to view . unfortunately , this one is as unsentimental as it gets . i can hardly wait for the release of his latest film volver on 04/03/07 . is n't life grand ? my personal rankings talk to her all about my mother women on the verge of a nervous breakdown flower of my secret law of desire live flesh matador bad education
