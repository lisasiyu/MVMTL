a personal cult movie ! this film is very often forgotten when you make the whole account of the great american films in any age . artur penn made a superb sociological portrait about the chase and wishes of revenge of the crowd with interesting insights and serious connotations . this film threw the ring to robert redford and gave brando another opportunity to play an unusual and magnificent role . and despite the multiple problems among penn and the illumination supervisor according to penn told in an interview with james lipton in inside the actor 's studio , the film deserves a special place in the reduced golden list of the great american artistic triumphs .
