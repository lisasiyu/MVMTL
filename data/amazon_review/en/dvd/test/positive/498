buckethead has it all ! this is an amazing dvd ! buckethead covers the entire spectrum ! he covers everything from science fiction , horror , zombies , classical art , pop art , funk , jazz , rock , alternative , progressive , etc . he is definately the frank zappa of the new century . his guitar playing is incredible and his compositions are mind boggling . i thoroughly enjoyed everything i have seen so far ( i am only through the first disc ) . but the navigation was no problem and extremely interesting . i loved the announcers voice ! i was immediately smiling and sometimes laughing outloud ! i just love his take on things . just the video for the wheels of torment is worth the price of the dvd . an amazing video . how did they take the classical painting of hell and disect it and animate it and throw in images of buckethead playing guitar - or was it a mandolin ? i also loved the ballad of buckethead with les claypool - he 's alive , he 's half dead , folks just call him buckethead ! great ! the dental commander was interesting animation and the bootsy collins - funky express card was so damned funny i could n't stop laughing . as well as the with the clips of the japanese monsters invading tokyo . i also loved hearing his early demos for guitar player . absolutely amazing guitar and composition . i really recommend this dvd to anyone who loves the guitar work of steve vai , joe satriani , mike keneally , frank zappa , adrian belew , john petrucci , etc . this guy is in the same league and then some . a very important guitar hero and composer . this dvd is worth ten times the cost . do n't miss it
