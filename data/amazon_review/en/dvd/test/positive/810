i do n't get it i do n't understand . how is it that so many people thought 1984 the movie was a masterpiece and yet they did n't give this great film the time of day . this movie is as good as 1984 ( the movie ) was bad . this is a perfect example of what communism really is , a good idea that could only work in a perfect world because hay , people ( and animals apparently ) are corrupt . theirs a reason they say absolute power corrupts absolutely . people are selfish , and this is why communism must always fail , because people do n't like to share and like being forced to share even less . this is one hell of a movie . not perfect , but way above the [ ... ] fest of a movie 1984 was . if you love gorge orwell than get this movie
