the war is over but the battle lives on ( wwe vs tna ) ! the only reason why i gave this 4 out of 5 stars is because even though the documentary as a whole was very good , i wished there was an additional dvd on it that featured more classic matches from raw and nitro and more additional interviews . i was a little upset when they censored ravishing rick rude taking cheap shots at the wwe in the extra 's menu because he said more than they shown on the dvd . they also censored x-pac 's interview when he 's taking cheap shots at hogan and bischoff when the showed the clip of him going back to the wwe from wcw . i did think eric bischoff did a great job telling his side of the story but he did leave out some small ( but major ) details as well as vince holding back some info . overall , a nice wwe dvd to add to your collection . i just wish they added more matches and interviews . tna better watch themselves .
