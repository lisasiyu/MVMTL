`` i ai n't afraid of no ghosts '' ivan reitman 's 1984 mega-hit , and it 's lesser sequel , are both included in this double feature dvd gift set that long time fans of the ghostbusters should consider an absolute must own . chances are you already know the story : three bumbling scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , and harold ramis ) lose their campus jobs and go into business for themselves . only thing is , their business involves capturing and containing gross and slimy ghosts throughout new york . also featuring sigourney weaver , ernie hudson , and rick moranis ; ghostbusters ended up being a super hit which spawned an animated series , tons of toys , and a sequel five years later . ghostbusters 2 , while nowhere near as wonderful as the first film but still pretty fun , finds the guys back in business as a new breed of evil is about to be birthed in time for new years . although this is n't the first time both films have appeared on dvd , there 's enough special features here to make this gift set worth picking up . there 's a nice selection of deleted scenes ( nothing substancial ) , a couple featurettes , and commentary from reitman and co. , but there 's no features devoted to ghostbusters 2 . instead , there are two animated episodes that are linked to the two films , and there 's an exclusive scrap book included too with a nice variety of information for fans . if you 've already been double dipped by the ghostbusters on dvd , picking this up is entirely up to you . however , if you 're a fan of these films and do n't own them on dvd , pick this affordable gift set up and enjoy
