although very violent & graphic , this is an awesome movie menace ii society is one of those films that leaves a powerful message that is not forgotten long after you have seen it . the story focuses on a teenage street thug who is caught in the middle of gang life and drugs but does n't know how to escape it . after getting carjacked while cruising with his cousin on the streets of south central la , the main character swears revenge on the gangsters who killed his cousin . this movie is very violent and has a lot of language , but it should be shown to every teenager entering high school to show them what can happen if they decide to hook up with the wrong people and make the wrong choices in life . although i did not like the ending very much , the impact of the film was very powerful and left quite an impact . it showed me that if you mess with the wrong people and do n't take responsibility for your actions , you will get dealt with and quite possibly , killed . the main character gets murdered because he sleeps with some chick and gets her pregnant . she tells him , and he 's like `` what the heck are you telling me for ? i had the plastic on extra tight . '' condoms are not foolproof . they can slip and they can break . if you are gon na be with a woman for one night , make sure she is on something else , or pull out . the digital transfer to the dvd is first rate . the audio is outstanding in both the 2 channel dolby surround format as well as the 5.1 channel digital tracks . highs and lows are both top notch ... be sure to warn your neighbors if you have thin walls . i had sound complaints after i played this movie on my system ! the bass from the subwoofer as well as the gunshots during the whole movie is so loud , you feel as if it is happening right in front of you . amazing..
