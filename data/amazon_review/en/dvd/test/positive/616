a true love brings maturity beautiful . when the movie begins , the young lead character is a selfish , self-absorbed , lazy young man . he is looking for the quickest way to make money with the least effort ... and like many of his peers , has an intense dislike for the refugee father and `` son '' who come to work with the company he is employed with . i mean , this fellow is just awful . he 's so obnoxious , you keep waiting for him to do something appealing so you can stop wishing he 'd fall off of the building . and then he does . he finds out , by accident , that the `` son '' is really a young woman . and he is immediately drawn to her . suddenly , instead of being the tormentor he is the protector , of her physically and of her secret . when events transpire that lead him to search for her ( well , i ca n't give everything away , now can i ? ) , we get to see the maturation process in action . caring for someone other than himself gives him a strength and a resolve that even he did not know he had and brings him to an incredible sacrifice to help out her family . iranian films rarely have what we would traditionally call `` happy endings '' . those are rare and not sought after . but there are endings that are n't horrid , just sort of sad , in a good way . it 's hard to explain , but this film supplies an excellent example . in iran , princes do n't rescue the princesses , they usually get mangled by the dragon , but it 's never a dull ride ( and in this case he does n't actually get mangled ... ) .
