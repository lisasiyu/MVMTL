hauntingly beautiful , a must-see for those who judge a movie by its screenplay the creators of this film had no ceilings on their vision of what they could bring to life when tackling the process of transforming the depths of the screenplay into the heights of a multidimensional cinematic experience . if you can see this on a big screen , do it . with shades of `` the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover , '' tarsem singh , the director , has fashioned his genius with his crew 's technical refinement . the movie itself is worth owning for the following reasons : vince vaughn and vincent d'onofrio on the same screen at the same time , two great actors in two great roles ; jennifer lopez way outside the box -- jlo only peaks out three times when her accent creeps back in on a few words ; the stunning visuals and special effects rival only those of `` what dreams may come ; '' this is tarsem singh 's directorial debut and it displays the mastery of his vocation ; and finally , the screenplay itself would have made a fascinating plot line under any direction , but auspiciously came to life under the wing of tarsem singh . warning : plot spoilers ahead . jennifer lopez is a psychologist who uses breakthrough neurological technology to enter the subconscious mind of a comatose child and then that of a serial killer , played by vincent d'onofrio . however , she has never tried `` reversing the feed , '' which involves bringing the other person into her subconscious mind because of the emotional dangers of such a mind merge . the highlight of the entire movie is when , against the will of her superiors , she decides to do this anyway and brings the killer into her own world where he appears as his little boy self . the incredible battle she must wage between bestowing compassion for the torture he endured from his father in childhood and delivering justice for the torture he has inflicted on innocent women as an adult comes climactically to fruition in a sequence of tragically requested and tragically rendered mercy . the terrible beauty of the death of suffering is brilliantly written , acted , directed and produced in a denoument that is priceless and at the very least worth the cost of the dvd . vincent d'onofrio is a gift to the screen and tarsem singh a gift to both actor and audience . enjoy this film even more the second time for its exploration of innocence versus experience , mercy versus justice , and life versus death
