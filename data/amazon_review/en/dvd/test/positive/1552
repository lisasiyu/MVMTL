the race begins i only began watching the amazing race a few years ago , in season six , i believe , so i never saw how the show got its start . this dvd gave me the chance to go back and look at where the amazing race began and how far the show has come in the last few years . the premise behind the amazing race is simple . race around the world and the first team to cross the finish line wins one million dollars . of course , with prize money like that , it wo n't be easy navigating your way around the world , but if you succeed , you get the cash . the race began ( and ended ) in new york city . teams traveled through south africa , china , india , thailand , france and numerous other places before returning to the united states for the completion of the race . along the way , eight teams of two were eliminated , leaving only three teams of two in the final leg . when the 11 teams of two left the starting line , they had no idea where they were going , or what they were doing . they got clues that led them to exotic destinations , places many of them had never been . it was fun to watch these americans try to get along in another country without speaking the language . there were some great challenges in the first version of the amazing race . contestants had to jump off a cliff in africa , navigate a crowded market in india , hike a steep portion of the great wall of china , drive a team of dogs in alaska , soar in a glider above italy and more . as the years have gone on , the challenges have remained difficult , but i believe that some of the ones in the first season were among the toughest . along the way , teams were met with road blocks , which were tasks that usually only one member of the team could complete , and detours , which gave teams the chance to make a choice on which way they wanted to proceed . often times choices made at detours could make up valuable time or put a team behind their competitors . teams also had the chance to use a fast forward . the first team to complete each fast forward , could skip all tasks on that leg of the race and go directly to the pit stop , which was located at the end of the leg . however , each team could only use one fast forward during the race and choosing when to use it was key . at the end of each leg , contestants would get a 12-hour break at the pit stop , where they could talk with other contestants and just relax and prepare for the next leg . the last team to check in at each leg was eliminated , with the exception of three legs that were non-elimination legs . in future editions , teams were penalized for coming in last at a non-elimination leg , but in the inaugural season , there were no such penalties . as the seasons have gone on , producers have tweaked the show to make it better . some of the things in the first season that were changed included the introduction . host phil keoghan would talk about what previously happened on the show and at the end , say 'who will be eliminated tonight . ' however , if you listen to that intro , you can tell when nobody 's going to be eliminated because he does n't use those words but others . now , on the intro , he says 'who will be eliminated next , ' which is much better . also , phil would only greet the last team , which always was a tip-off to the last place finishers that they were indeed , last . now , phil greets every team and that makes it more dramatic for the teams . the teams in the first season were also much like the teams in every season i 've watched . you have the requisite gay couple ( joe and bill aka team guido ) , the spunky grandparents ( dave and margaretta ) , the parent-child team ( nancy and the very cute emily ) , the macho guy teams ( drew and kevin , rob and brennan ) , the underdog two women teams ( pat and brenda , kim and leslie ) and a few young couples using the race as a gauge of their relationship ( paul and amie , matt and ana , lenny and karen , frank and margarita ) . this formula has been used on most of the editions i have watched , though , i am not arguing with it . it seems to work . team guido was the team everybody loved to hate , thanks to their cockiness and sneakiness . it was tough to watch frank and margarita racing to the finish line , thinking they were first , when in reality , that was not the case . my favorite two teams were frat brothers drew and kevin and nancy and emily . drew and kevin were just a riot . they made me laugh at every turn , yelling at each other , but always managing to stay in the race until almost the end . nancy and emily made it farther than anyone expected them to , which is always nice to see . they fought through some difficult times , particularly in india , but came through stronger as a team . plus , emily was pretty darned cute . as far as extras go , this set has a lot , but the way they are set up is different . you can watch the episodes with a choice to go look at unaired footage , but you ca n't see the footage any other place . it would have been nice to package that another way , but it is still nice that it is included . there are four episodes of commentary , two from rob and brennan and team guido and two from lenny and karen and drew and kevin . there is also a look back at the first season with the aforementioned teams , keoghan and the executive producers . there is a look inside the making of the first season and how difficult the logistics were . it is interesting to hear the producers talk about how they were often on the same plane as the contestants and barely steps ahead of them for much of the way . all told , this is a solid release of the very first season . it would be nice to see more seasons released . season seven has also been released , but i would love to see seasons two through six as well
