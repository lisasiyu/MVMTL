an absolutely gorgeous movie watching mirrormask is like being immersed in the absolute best of dreams ; the kind that pull us out of ourselves and makes us wonder who we really are inside . this may sound a bit cheesy , but the imagery in this movie is fascinating , and simply , just really fun to watch . mirrormask it not a once-through movie , once you see it once , you want to see it again , the visuals are just too much for simply one go . and this is one of the great beauties of the movie : for all of the complex visual that it offers , the storyline offers the delicious contrast of being rather simple and sweet . definitely a children 's movie that really delivers
