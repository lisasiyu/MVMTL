highly recommended ! ! ! i first found out hannah montana when i realised i saw billy ray cyrus , thinking it was someone else at first . thank goodness i was wrong ! ! ! i am quite older than being 13 , ( almost 30 ) but i loved billy ray cyrus when he first came out in early 1990 's , and still do . now that his daughter miley has her own show and an awesome voice , i not only do i get to see and hear him again , but also his own daughter following a similar career as he has . i knew i had to buy the dvd , not question there . it 's a piece of my past , when i was a teen , but it 's a great way to remind myself that life is not always about work . it tells me to be a kid at heart , and laugh every now and then ! !
