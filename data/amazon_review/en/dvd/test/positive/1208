nice date night movie ! add one part love story and one part baseball sports flick and you have a great date night movie ! this is a wonderful movie to watch . kelly preston and kevin costner do really great jobs of playing their roles in this movie , but more importantly the storyline is really well done . costner plays an aging professional pitcher at the end of his career . on the last game he pitches , we see not only what is going on in his mind as a professional pitcher , but also flashbacks of his career over the years and his on again/off again romantic relationship with preston 's character . definitely worth watchin
