the long journey of an artist andrei rublyov ( 1969 ) by andrei tarkovsky is my number 1 ( shares with tarkovsky 's zerkalo ) film of all time . it is a pinnacle of film-making for me - one of few most visually beautiful films as well as one of the deepest films ever . the beauty of every frame is exquisite - i have to pause film very often just to admire it.there are only couple of more films that have touched me as profoundly as andrei rublyov did . i am always surprised to hear that it is very slow film - for tarkovsky , it is very well paced , and i am never tired of its 3+ hours running time . film based on life of the 15-th century monk and icon painter andrei rublyov who wanders through the country torn by barbarism , and later by tatar invaders . tarkovsky explores several very important topics in his film : what is talent and how an artist is responsible for it ? the man and god , the artist and the power . the final 20 minutes of the film are the best and most inspiring i 've seen in the cinema . for me , the last chapter of the film , `` the bell '' is perhaps the greatest in its emotional impact piece of cinema ever made . i ca n't stay calm and collected when i see it . boriska sobbing like a child after his bell rings - and he is a child , a boy , lonely and lost ; andrei breaking his vows of silence , his words to boriska of hope , of many roads they would walk together . andrei 's icons that we are finally allowed to behold and admire , their breathtaking divine beauty and serenity , their melodic lines and pure joyful colors , the faces of the saints and angels with their eternal mystery , quiet knowledge and sadness , looking inside themselves and inside our very souls ; the music that literally takes you somewhere above this earth , to the heights of such purity and beauty that you could hardly breath and where even the `` swiftest birds '' of pain and death ca n't reach you ...
