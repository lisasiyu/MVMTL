an intruiging plot , with a good message insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies , and the consequnces they can produce . it is very well acted on both pacino 's and williams part , and swank was brilliant as well . besides all that good stuff , i am also a fan of the director , `` ever since i saw batman begins '' and find his artistic vision to be incredible . the only problem i had with this movie was the ending . sure , it showed how lying could defeat a person , but i thought a little redemption would have been nice . however , if you have a strong stomach , or a good editing company , i suggest you see this .
