the best movie version i am happy to report that this is not only better than the other movie versions of the prince and the pauper , but that it is a very good movie . the 1937 version ( a.k.a . `` the errol flynn version '' ) is quite good , but the ending was boggled by the introduction of an unnecessary and unhelpful delaying action , which was then made worse by being repeated ( ! ) , dispelling the high tension of the climactic end . the twins who played the lead were very appealing but were made to speak in a very phony ( sickeningly sweet ) way . there are also technical limitations , such as the sound quality . i 'd give it 4 stars . the 1978 version with an all-star cast had much going for it . the big stars all played their roles well , but the movie was ruined by using a 20 year-old boy to play the 12 year-old prince . and he was repellant as well . also , the `` rollicking '' scenes went on a bit too long and too often . i 'd give it 3 stars . fortunately ( and for a change ) , the screenwriters learned from these past versions and this version is flawless . the story rolled smoothly , not too fast , not slow , without repetitions or unnecessary delays or needless complications . the twins who played the lead were appealing and played their parts well . all of the cast were good . the color , the photography , the music , the sound -- all good . the ending was just right . this version also added a coda in which the prince of wales kept his various promises made to the several poor people who had been kind to him . bottom line : do n't miss it . also , the whole family can enjoy this one .
