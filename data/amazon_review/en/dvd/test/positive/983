enjoyable but a bit disappointing martin scorsese is unquestionably one of the grand masters of american film and no one deserves to have an oscar sitting on their desk more than he . but , of course , scorsese really should have won for mean streets , taxi driver , raging bull , or goodfellas , and the multiple wins for this film seem rather clearly to be belated recognition by the industry for total career achievement . this is a decent , entertaining picture , but it is not going to go down in history as one of his best , i think , or one of the best pictures of recent years . the acting is all quite excellent as you would expect from this perhaps too overloaded cast : it almost feels like overkill with all the great actors crammed into this movie in sometimes rather small parts . damon is surprisingly good , capitalizing well on his inherent charming slickness , and walhberg stands out , though he is on screen too rarely . dicaprio does a nice job , except that i think sometimes the pressure to have him play `` vulnerable '' and soul-searching ran counter to the moments of the narrative : that no one believes him to be the cop , given the visibly conflicted nervous way he reacts to pressure or violence , is a bit preposterous . the basic storyline , which is almost exactly the same , scene for scene , as in infernal affairs , is a pretty neat one , with a lot of nice reversals and twists , though anyone would have to admit that it is a rather unrealistic and implausible series of developments in either movie . but , somehow , for me , this film just ultimately did n't really all come together despite all the positive elements put into it . perhaps because i had seen the original version of this tale , the specific changes and updates made to it in monahan 's script to make things `` scorsesian '' seemed to stand out too much and come off as weirdly mannered and formulaic . in the end , i had this peculiar feeling like i had just seen almost an imitation scorsese crime film put together by someone else out of scenes or moments or stylistic flavors from his previous ones , pasted onto the infernal affairs framework . it may be that , after the mixed reception and financial disappointments of his most recent , more personal projects , a calculated decision was made to return to safer ground , to gangland loyalties in a heavily ethnic urban environment , and thus maybe even scorsese 's heart was n't totally into this project ; while certainly there 's an energy here , the technical work does n't seem quite as inspired or careful as some of his other work . it may also be that , after living with the sopranos for years and all the scorsese wanna-be mob pictures , that i am as a viewer a bit burned out on some of the specific dynamics of the genre , that some of the things that originally seemed fresh and surprising are now after all these years finally turning into cliches for me . so , certainly recommended for viewing , but the departed is unlikely to be remembered as one of the true highlights of a fantastic career when all is said and finally done
