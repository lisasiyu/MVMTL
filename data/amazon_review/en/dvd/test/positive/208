how wonderful to see womyn of all ages , sizes and colors showing their true beauty ! i really liked this dvd . i already enjoy belly dancing for my husband and this dvd teaches sexy moves that can easily be combined with belly dance moves to seduce your man . here are some perfect examples of bellydancing and striprteasing combinations . 1 . using wrist circles , which is one of the most basic belly dance moves , to emphasize hip movements when stripping . 2 . facing away from your lover , go from another basic belly dancing move , snake arms , into a striptease move , hugging yourself . 3 . while doing a hip drop , a belly dancing move , do a sensual slide , a striptease move . and the 'ol bump and grind is identical to a hip circle ! ah , the fine art of seduction ! not to mention shoulder shinnies , which i still ca n't seem to do at all well , how frustrating ! my only criticism is the end part where the striptease is demonstrated is much to long . plus , it was n't neccessary to include the lovemaking scene . a little more instruction on exotic dancing could been substituted , such as lap dancing .
