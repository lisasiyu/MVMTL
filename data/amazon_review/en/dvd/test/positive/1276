how far we 've come when i watched this classic documentary , i could n't help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here , we just would n't make it . what it took for inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls , body-piercing , hummers and rap music , underneath it all is a heritage that is raw , rich and admirable ; and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up . it would be interesting to produce nanook ii and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now .
