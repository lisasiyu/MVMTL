too bad no language options ... everything about this dvd was perfect ... except they do n't have the original japanese version as an option in it . i know lots of people who like to switch it to japanese and put on the english subtitles instead of watching funimation 's version of the show . this dvd has no language or subtitle options , so as long as you do n't mind watching only the american version , it 's a great dvd . i gave the dvd five stars anyway though , because yu yu hakusho is too great a show to deserve any less . this dvd is the first of the dark tournament saga , it is the next dvd after `` rescue yukina '' and is the dvd before `` deathmatch '' . i do n't have to state the episodes since someone already has prior to me . enjoy the show
