a confused new order fanatic ! can someone please let me know if this is the dvd box set titled item . some reviwers say it is , others insist it is n't . based on amazon 's product description it sounds as if this is the item set . regardless , amazon need to correct either the dvd title or the content description . i 'd just like to say that , personally , new order peaked with technique . everything they released up to and including that lp was brilliant . the perfect kiss promo video is sublime . if this is the item box set , it 's worth owning just to see the full length version of the uk made neworderstory documentary . it 's a pity what became of new order . they were once brilliant .
