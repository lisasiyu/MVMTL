`` he took the bait . '' gynecologist , catherine ( fanny ardant ) discovers hard evidence that her husband , bernard ( gerard depardieu ) is having an adulterous affair . she confronts him , and he reluctantly admits that he 's `` occasionally '' unfaithful . the details he gives catherine are vague and sketchy , and the lack of intimacy in their relationship increases with bernard 's admission . instead of demanding details of the affairs , catherine nurses the shock . in the aftermath of catherine 's new knowledge , she quietly reevaluates her marriage and bernard . one evening , catherine enters a bar . the bar is full of girls who host clients of both sexes in the rooms upstairs . one of the girls , marlene ( emmanuelle beart ) approaches catherine , and they strike up a conversation . catherine employs marlene to approach and seduce bernard . marlene posing as `` nathalie '' is then to return to catherine and give her the details . `` nathalie '' is an interesting twist on the old adultery story . catherine , the wronged wife , nurses her anguish , and then converts it into something peculiar . she selects a woman she finds extremely attractive , and then gives this woman the task of seducing bernard . is she motivated to get the details she just imagines ? is employing nathalie an attempt to control her husband 's sexuality ? is a warped revenge at the heart of catherine 's conduct or is nathalie a surrogate ? while the film is not for the easily offended , it 's more an intellectual exercise in human sexuality -- there are a couple of sex scenes , but sex is talked about more than actually committed . while the very best french films do n't provide a definitive answer , nathalie has a vagueness that leaves a certain lingering dissatisfaction . in spite of the fact that emmanuelle beart in lingerie is pivotal to the film 's promotion , this is fanny ardant 's film . `` nathalie '' is ultimately a woman 's film with adultery presented from the female viewpoint -- make no mistake about that . if you enjoy this film , i 'd also recommend another film from director anne fontaine , `` dry cleaning '' . `` nathalie '' is in french with english subtitles -- displacedhuma
