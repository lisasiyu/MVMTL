nice boxset but the packaging ! ugh ! i wo n't go on about the contents of this nice boxset as it has all been addressed already , but i thought i should add that upon receiving my shipment today i was dismayed to find all 3 discs rolling around free from their hubs ! this poor packaging virtually guarantees damage to the dvds ... if it was n't limited i would demand a replacement , but i 'm not sending mine back and hope they still have one to replace it . the replacement would more than likely have the same loose dvd problem anyway . boxset 4 stars , packaging ( disc protection rated only ) 0 stars . disappointed
