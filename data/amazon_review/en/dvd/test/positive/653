one of the best ! ! this was the third anime series i had ever seen . the first was cowboy bebop , then outlaw star . with that in mind , realize that i saw this entire series on one sunday afternoon-night . this was the first `` giant robot '' series i had ever seen . i was verrrrrrrrrrrry dissapointed with the ending and have not seen the movies yet , but i still really enjoyed the show . this series offers emotional reaction that i had not felt from any other show or movie in years ... this collection at such a low price is an absolute value , my only advice is to skip most of the 5th or 6th ? disc and watch the directors versions of the last 4 or 5 episodes on the last disc instead
