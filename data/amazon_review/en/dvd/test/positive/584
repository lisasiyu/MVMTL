one of john wayne 's best performances this post-war made film ( 1951 ) about wwii is rather retrospective and honest in its telling of the tale . wayne is very good here in an uncomplicated role . mixing , submarines , lurking enemy , and old flings or ex-flings with a lot of macho dialogue ( without preaching ) along the way , this film does not fail to entertain . george waggner 's direction give a lot of freedom to get his story across .
