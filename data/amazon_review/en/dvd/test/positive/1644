stunning ! i will not go into a synopsis of the material as that is readily available but will comment on the series itself having viewed them all . this is a stunning collection of the early work of the `boys` and is presented from restored 35mm material much of which is taken from the original surviving negatives . several of the titles in the series , have until fairly recently , been considered lost forever . each disc has detailed information on the titles and every film is presented with either the original vitaphone sound on disc ( again recently discovered ) synchronised with the picture or with a composite vitaphone soundtrack . even for those who don`t normally view `silent` movies these are astounding prints of what is now the historic formation of one the most inventive and forever lasting comedy teams ever to grace the silver screen . each disc deserves five stars for content , quality and value .
