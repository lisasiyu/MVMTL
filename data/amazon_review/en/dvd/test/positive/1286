exactly what i wanted ! this dvd is exactly what i was looking for - a plain `` old-fashioned '' aerobics class like the ones i attended back in the early 90s when i lost a lot of weight . i put some back on over the last few years and i knew that aerobics would be the thing to help me . all the classes at all the gyms around here are `` specialized '' - pilates , yoga , spinning , step , etc . - and not what i wanted . i have seen gilad 's shows on fit tv but i hated the commercials . so i went looking for a dvd and bought this one . i love it ... i was exhausted after it was done but i felt great . it is good for all levels . if you want a great , challenging and motivated aerobic workout , this is the dvd for you
