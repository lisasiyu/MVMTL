& quot ; a true rapper & quot ; this dvd is great , this dvd shows the real tupac just like the other reviewers said.. one thing puzzled me this whole time ever since tupac got murdered..is he dead or alive ? ? i 've been putting alot of thought into this.. i came to a conclusion , but i 'm not really sure.. my conclusion is that he could still be alive.. after he got shot he was of course rushed to the hospital , then some how he survived the shots , then after that he probably told the fbi or the cops or whatever that he does n't want the public to know if he 's dead or alive , the reason to this ? ? i think because if the public knew then of course the gangsters that put this whole murder plot up would know too.. this way the gangsters dunno if he 's dead or alive so they cant do anytin anymore about tupac..tupac is probably livin in a paradise sum where in this world far away from the public and the fbi is probably supportin him by giving him food and all that stuff ... of course my theory can probably be wrong.. i guess god will only know & amp ; the fbi..
