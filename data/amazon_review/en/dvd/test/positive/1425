good show about a great fighter plane in world war ii this dvd has been taken from a early-forties era documentary film made with stateside audiences in mind . it was probably shown in theaters before the main shows during the war years . one of the big pluses is that the film is in color , and that the color is strikingly good for a combat film . directed by academy award winner william wyler ( best known for 'ben-hur ' and the original documentary of 'the memphis belle ' ) , the film depicts life -- and death -- in a p-47 thunderbolt squadron based in italy . it gives the viewer a good look at italy , not just the base itself . the strafing runs are excellent , taken by a camera mounted in the planes on actual missions . for a wartime propaganda film , it is quite honest and deals with the suffering of noncombatants , showing bombed-out buildings , children playing near a burned corpse , and haggard , war-weary men and women . the aerial footage is excellent , the dialogue is good , and the quality of the picture is also good . the film also shows the tragic results of a thunderbolt crash quite graphically , as if to remind the viewer that war is a dangerous game and that there is never any guarantee that the pilots will return from their missions . this color film runs around 45 minutes . it is well worth the price
