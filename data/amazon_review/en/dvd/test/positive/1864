dvd ! at last ! ! ! i 've been waiting for this film on dvd for years ! thank goodness , it 's here and wo n't disappoint . clean crisp and sharp with great sound quality ! as a film it is a true piece of art with some of the best performances ever assembled ! i lived in waxahachie where much of the film was shot and was in the `` heart '' house as it is called . believe me , the cinematography in this film is worth the price of the dvd ! texas never looked better ! this film would make a terrific companion piece to `` the trip to bountiful '' which was also filmed around the waxahachie , texas area . `` places '' on dvd ! it 's about time ! now how about `` bountiful '' on dvd
