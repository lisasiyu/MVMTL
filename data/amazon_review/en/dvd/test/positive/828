really good movie while i am not a richard gere fan , i have to say this is a really good movie . a loving wife has an affiar with a french stranger . her husband eventually finds out and has his revenge , but only for a moment until he has realized what he has done . now he must decided to come clean , or just pretend it did not happen . the bulk of the movie is the affair and all the places and ways she cheats . but a good movie , diane lane , and olivier martenez make it very watchable
