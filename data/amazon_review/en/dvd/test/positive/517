fun and entertaining i can not help but laugh every time i see people bashing each other over a movie . disliking a certain film is one thing . but for somebody to go out of their way and flagrantly insult a total stranger over their enjoyment of a particular film they happened to hate is unnecessary and immature . amazon should police these reviews a bit more seriously . `` critters '' is a fond and harmless throwback to the sort of monster movie so prevalent in the mid-1950s sci-fi boom . i can not so easily classify the plot as straight-up horror , because it really is n't . this is more of a hodgepodge . you get a smattering of horror , comedy , and science fiction all rolled up within a singular and satisfying package . i caught this in a theater with my father twenty years ago , and it has always remained a guilty pleasure of mine . none of the special effects are overdone , the writing is suitable , and i found most of the cast agreeable and entertaining . i have found over the years that many of us tend to take our movies way too seriously . in the end , i could really care less that `` critters '' does n't follow the rules of reality . because , when i pay to see movies like this , reality is something i want to escape from .
