john ford/john wayne : american classics i ordered this dvd set as a birthday present to myself , and i was n't disapointed . the new print of `` the searchers '' with all the extras ( lobby cards , reprint of the dell comic , and not to mention the documentaries make this a fantastic dvd set -- in addition you get a two dvd set for stagecoach ( which started the ford/wayne partnership ) , fort apache , she wore a yellow ribbon,3 godfaters , they were expendable , wings of eagles , and the long voyage home . the only thing i would have chaged is that i would have made almost all the movies in this set westerns ( the searchers , stagecoach , fort apache , she wore a yellow ribbon , rio grande,3 godfathers , the man who shot liberty valance , and the quiet man ( which is n't a western , but i think it fits in well ) would have been my choice for the set . that aside i think all the movies in this set are great and any fan of john ford ( or john wayne ) will not be disappointed .
