a funny train from somewhere sad a funny look at a dramatic world through the eyes of railway workers in a small town in wartime czechoslovakia . i enjoyed watching this movie , it really is a hopeful and humorous story about human beings in times of turmoil . this is czechoslovakia during world war ii . the nazis are officially in control , and actively imposing their bureaucracy on the nation . our protagonist is young milos hrma , whose father is a retired railway man , and spends the day sitting at home , looking at his watch , and telling everyone where each train in now . he encourages his son to find employment at the local village railway depot . easily the youngest employee at the depot , milos wants to fit in , be admired , be a man . he wears the uniform of a train dispatcher , but does n't seem comfortable in it yet . while other reviewers have mentioned young milos ' talk of wanting to have sex , which is actually quite funny in its stark honesty , much can be lost in our descriptions . this is a comedy , not a prurient display . it seems that sex is simply the path milos believes he must take to be a man . it is his naivety and honesty with his fellow railway employees that makes the whole deal such a riot . this self-created drama keeps his mind off of what is happening around him . some may be offended by this , in which case i 'd suggest you 'd probably be happier buying a thomas the tank engine dvd . milos does show himself a man ... and it has little to do with s-e-x . very worth watching ! some of the scenes are terrific -- i liked the scene where milos goes up to kiss the female conductor as the train is about to pull away and then ... oh , i wo n't ruin it for you ! it really is a funny film set in a heartbreaking time . all the more interesting that it was shot in 1966 . reccommended for comedy buffs and railway workers everywhere . i wish that sort of exitement happened on my train ! :
