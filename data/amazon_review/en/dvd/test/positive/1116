incredible wow.what a series.it tackles all types of uncannily real situations and people.this is a real human show and left me feeling the entire gamma of feelings : crying , laughing , anger , etc.i love the family represented in six feet under and find myself talking about them and their situations with my girlfriend as if they were real people.this show reflects life so well.if you have n't watched this yet you are in for a treat.i 'm saving up for the complete series.i found that we had to ration ourselves to 2 episodes a night so it would last.i love the fishers and keith ... and brenda ... 6fu is the best series of them all and i 'm an owner and big fan of deadwood,24 , the sopranos , curb your enthusiasm
