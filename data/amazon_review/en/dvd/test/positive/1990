how could you not like this film ? when a film is a horror/epic/monster/romance/martial arts/period film ... what is not to like ? if genre-bending films upset you then you wo n't like it . this movie is for everyone with an open mind . `` brotherhood of the wolf '' takes you places , and it 's directed and acted very well . great action , acting , and special effects . i like to keep my reviews on the shorter side , and this one is no different ... check it out it is worth the money .
