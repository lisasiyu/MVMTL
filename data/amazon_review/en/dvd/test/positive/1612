great movie i just love thailand ! ! ! i 've been to all the locations the movie was shot at , which gives it that much more appeal and familiarity ! a star gets taken away for the obvious movie mistakes . when will they learn machine guns do not have unlimited rounds , and they are not double action and click multiple times after the rounds have finished . an m16 expends its 30rd mag in less than 2 secs at full auto - same for the ak-47 . the amount of violence was superb
