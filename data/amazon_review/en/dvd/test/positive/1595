a riveting documentary i am not a fan of russian culture or history , but when i saw this program on the history channel , my fingers never picked up the remote control . i never channel-surfed once . there was more drama , intrigue , action , and violence in this documentary about real people than in any soap opera drama . it reminded me that nothing imagined on tv or in the movies can compare with real people and events in history
