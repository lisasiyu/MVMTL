bzzzzzzzzzzzzz ... & quot ; the fly & quot ; is a well made / known sci-fi classic . andre ( david hedison ) is a scientist , working on a contraption that disintegrates solid matter , sending it to another location to be re-integrated . andre wants to develop it for the good of mankind , but that would make for one dull movie ! instead , he accidentally enters the disintegration chamber with an undetected fly . the two become fused into one being . andre ends up with a fly head and claw . the fly gets andre 's head and upper body . andre 's wife is tested to the depths of her love for her now hideous husband . a frantic search for the tiny fly ensues ( maybe they could de-fuse them ? ? ) with tragic results . vincent price is excellent as andre 's brother . yes , it 's true that & quot ; return of the fly & quot ; is nowhere near as good as it 's predocessor . however , i like having them both together anyway . andre 's son phillipe is all grown up and decides to continue his father 's work . he enlists the help of a guy who turns out to be a sociopathic criminal , bent on stealing the invention and selling it to an accomplice . after killing a nosey cop ( by turning him into a guinea pig man ) , he knocks phillipe out and puts him in the disintegration cabinet with a suspiciously handy fly . the rest of the film is a revenge story . i like the crooks and the way phillipe avenges their treachery . a great double feature ! pop some corn , pour the beverages , and check the house for those pesky insects..
