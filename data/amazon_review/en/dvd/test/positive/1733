semi-good . semi-tough is one of the few football movies i never got around to seeing until the other day and i am sorry i waited . it is a humorous , energetic send-up of football , celebrities , and post-sixties new age mumbo-jumbo . as for what another reviewer said about jill clayburgh , i have to agree , she 's completely miscast here , but that 's my only acting criticism . i think reynolds is outstanding in this role and really stands out . he is compelling and believable as billy clyde puckett and his presence basically carries the film . what i found most unique and valuable here , however , was the satire involving friedrich bismark and beat -- which was a paper-thin roast of werner erhard and est . it is rather courageous that this movie decided to tangle with those parasites in the way they did , but it remains a rare example of hollywood using its special position in society to advance the public good . there are other inventive parodies here as well such as the owner 's devotion to `` moveogenics , '' and reynolds having to get `` pelted '' by a quack doctor . on the whole , semi-tough is a good bit of fun and also has something to say to its audience .
