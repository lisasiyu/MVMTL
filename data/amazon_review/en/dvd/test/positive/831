my two year old enjoys it quite a bit ... this is my two year olds first bob the builder . he has generally only wanted to watch a baby mozart and nothing else , but the first time he watched it , he was hooked . he would sit there and nothing could distract him . he really enjoys the opening song of bob the builder , but he does get a little bored toward the end of the show . with that said , the first 20 minutes are gold for him as he really enjoys it . this is not too bad for us adults either except for lofty who is always whiny and tough to listen to , but it is a nice little show . he would give the show 2 thumbs up ! we will be trying some additional bob the builder dvds
