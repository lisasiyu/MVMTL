pain relief ... thank you god ! finally , the looong wait is over ! a decent sequel to the first two movies ! laurie strode ( jamie lee curtis ) is back ! she 's 20 years older ( yet , still beautiful ) , tougher , and wiser . laurie now works at a private school in california , where she struggles to forget that night in 1978 . her son john ( josh hartnet ) is enrolled in the same school and must face the very devil that haunts / hunts his mum . though there is a relatively low body count , h2o delivers good suspense and more intelligence than the idiotic sequels 4-6 ( i do n't consider h3 a sequel ) . h2o is the perfect final√© to the trilogy . unfortunately , halloween resurrection exists now , and i 'm sure that hollywood will crank out fifty more just like it ...
