love it ; great beginner yoga dvd when i decided to try yoga this was the first dvd that i purchased . it is fantastic . i have since bought another 3 of ravi & ana 's dvds , and several done by other people . the other choices do not come anywhere near the standard and style of ravi & ana . thank you to them for making my discovery of yoga a true pleasure
