blues deluxe what 's not to like about lightning in a bottle ? you can scarcely argue with its roster of talent . it features odetta , ruth brown , b.b . king , solomon burke , shamekia copeland , dr. john , , buddy guy , clarence `` gatemouth '' brown , honeyboy edwards , shamekia copeland , mavis staples , robert cray , keb mo , bonnie raitt ... the list goes on . natalie cole was bluesier than i ever would have imagined . as were steven tyler and joe perry of aerosmith . i 'd seen david johansen in his blues incarnation , so i was n't surprised by his transition from new york doll to buster poindexter to bluesman . also very good were some folks i 'd heard of , but had never heard : india.arie , angelique kidjo . i was n't as impressed by rapper chuck d. although his anti-war version of `` boom boom '' certainly had its heart in the right place . john fogerty 's version of `` midnight special , '' which he had recorded with ccr , did n't really bring anything new to the song , but it was pretty good . macy gray , doing `` hound dog , '' was better than i 'd expected too . i 've found her voice a little irritating on some of the songs i 've heard of hers , but it 's hard to go wrong with a straight ahead tune like `` hound dog . '' see it with someone you love . or alone ... .but if you care about the blues as an art form , do see it
