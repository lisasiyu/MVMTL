great dancing really nice dancing , with some innovative moves and choreography . the dancers are definetely top notch , just like their credentials would suggest . if do not want to watch another booooring and hokey ballroom show , this is the dvd for you . it ranks up there with `` shall we dance '' ( japanese version ) as a great dance dvd . the last samba number is amazing . if there is one thing i would change with the show , it is that it does not have enough latin dancing . i kept waiting in vain for another chacha and a good salsa or rueda , and nothing happened ( `` burn the floor '' guys - are you listening ! ? )
