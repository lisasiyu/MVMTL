a highsierrabassplayer five-star rating ! the difference between the reviewers loping off a star and those giving this dvd a five-star is obvious - the lopers are people that do n't play ! this dvd ( three actually ) is an excellent production in sound and video quality as well as performance . the supporting bands are excellent as well . hey , we 're all aging , even you three and four star critics . it is indeed rare to get blues and jazz from these masters in the first place , and all the live performances will preserve our blues and jazz heritage . if you love the blues and jazz , this dvd is pure and simply excellent .
