what a classic , glad i own it this is one of those great and rare movies from the 80 's that you can not find in any video stores . i know there is some person out there saying `` well who wants to rent it '' to often to many times we get caught up in our own generation with our own music , movies and all the new things that technology has put out there to even give a movie a chance from a different era . i collect alot of movies and have tried to collect ones i watched when i was growing up such as tourist trap , curtains. , and the little girl who lives down the lane . today there are a lot of movies being remade like the amityville horror and the texas chainsaw massacre please do yourself a favor and watch these movies that were first made and copied so poorly also give the actors from the original movies a chance such as james brolin , marilyn burns and gunnar hansen as leatherface these are true and serious actors they really had to act , todays stars are usually standing in front of a green screen . i have to admit i do own some of the remakes but there will always only be the originals first . thanks yvonne and steiger you rule
