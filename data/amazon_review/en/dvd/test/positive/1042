enjoyable ... ..it may seem simple..cheap cgi graphics and bad acting and uknown actors..but still the action in the movie is really good , from africa to roterdamn or however u spell it.. one notetable scene was the last scene , where jackie chan takes on 2 guys at the same time on top of a skyscraper..he kicks both their asses..after that he decides to jump off a steep part of the building ... instead of using the elevator , ,only jc can pull something off like that..i think this is prolly jc 's last great film..in hk..i dint really like his u.s. features..the action in those was weak..and the fighting was jus.. really amtatuer , iguess he had to slow down in the american films..anyhow if u lookn for a good jc movie..go out and buy this one..it can rank with supercop..police story 1 and 2..and project a..real good movie ... 2 thumbs u
