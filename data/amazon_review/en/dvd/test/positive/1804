fabulous set design , loved the acting , does n't get any better than this ! i have to agree with michael la vean 's review in many ways . la vean 's review mentions that the film must have had an unlimited budget . i had this same thought throughout the entire film . you will be in heaven for 6 hours if you love extremely detailed period design & costumes ( here most , possibly all - i ca n't remember - were filmed in the historically correct chateaux & palaces ) . if you adore fabulous 18th & early 19th century french interiors , which i am sadly obsessed with , then you will absolutely be entranced . it was all executed so incredibly well down to every last detail . the acting in the film was magnificent . isabella rossellini was incredibly charming as the character of josephine . this was by far the best role that i 've ever seen her play . christian clavier was so charming i developed a bit of a crush on him by the end of the movie . john malkovich , was extremely convincing and played his role absolutely beautifully as well . i consider him to be one of the few ( if not the best ) great actors of this age . gerard depardieu played his role wonderfully . if you were to read a novel with a character similar to napoleon you would n't believe it to be possible for someone to have had such a productive life in the short amount of time spent on earth . a beautiful film that i will treasure for many years ! i hope that a & e will be able to continue be involved with equally beautiful films based on history ! !
