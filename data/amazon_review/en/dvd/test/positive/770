fun fun fun ! glad i bought it ! after reading a lot of reviews , i decided to give this dvd a chance . it was the first dance workout dvd that i purchased and i 'm really having a hard time finding another one that is as much fun . ( i just ordered her african/latin one and hope it 's as good ! ) the biggest plus is that it keeps me interested and going back for more . i do this workout at least twice a week and find myself feeling like i actually exercised without trying . i hate to exercise , so it 's definitely a selling factor that i actually look forward to doing this . if you are n't a dancer , it will be a smidgen difficult at first , but you know that if you keep doing it that you 'll catch on . it 's not as hopeless as some of the other ones that i bought ... . and helped me discover that i 've got no future in hip-hop ! madonna has a good personality and teaches you without you even knowing that you 're learning choreography . i learned some fun moves and my teenage relatives gave me `` cool points '' when i pulled out the routine while we were dancing around the livingroom : - ) i would definitely recommend this dvd
