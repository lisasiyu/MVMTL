the funnier side of vietnam although the subject matter itself is n't amusing the characters in the film are . they seem to make light of a bad situation , the likes of which are n't seen anywhere else that i know of with the exception of good morning vietnam . i enjoyed the action scene in this film almost as much as i enjoyed the comic releif , but not as much as i liked the music
