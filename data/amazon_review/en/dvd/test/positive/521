well worth the wait the conflicting reviews on this one made me stop and think , but i decided to purchase it anyway , and i am glad that i did . for those who are puzzled or disappointed by the absence of gibson guitars , marshall amps , etc. , i would recommend that they watch the interview segments on disc 2 , in which bruce explains that they had originally tried the gibson/marshall setup , but that it simply did not work . it would be well to consider that cream had not played together for 37 years , so that it was rather like forming a new band ; however , this set affirms that all the elements are still in place , and the band delivers solid performances throughout . there are some persons who contend that baker and bruce were broke and desperate , and somehow convinced clapton to play with them to bail them out . however , in the interview segments , both clapton and baker confirm that it was clapton 's idea , with baker stating that he `` was n't very keen on doing it '' initially , until clapton coaxed him into it . bruce looks terribly frail , and is seated during some parts of the show ; however , his bass and vocal work are superb . clapton , who has aged well , shows that he has lost none of the fire and flair of the old days , and the 68-year-old baker displays a level of skill and stamina rarely seen in drummers half his age . while it is true that these performances are somewhat different from the originals , the updated renditions are amazingly good ; after all , improvisation was always one of the factors which set cream apart from other bands . in an era when phony , hybrid versions of 60's-era bands seem to be everywhere , it is refreshing to see all the original members of one of the most influential bands of all time put aside their differences , re-form , and deliver quality performances of some of the greatest songs ever written . having viewed this set several times since buying it , i feel that it would have been a bargain at twice the price . thanks and kudos to ginger , jack , and eric - long live the cream
