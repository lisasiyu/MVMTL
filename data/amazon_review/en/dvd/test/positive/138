wake up ! i think orwell could almost sit up and cackle `` i told you so ! '' even as we gobble nachos and watch monday night football ( or pbs or fox - does n't matter ) . between the propaganda we are fed by the republican mercantilists or the democratic marxists , there is little truth . watch this film , then try to find a theater showing aaron russo 's `` america : from freedom to fascism '' . then be afraid - but not for long . get up and take action
