enthralling , painful , profound , cathartic thoreau said `` the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation . '' while this may be true of some , others are not so quiet . caouette has unleashed a tidal wave of agony and angst , at times a shill scream of adolescent suffering , at other times a low moan of early adult-onset life affliction . truly , many of us know the feeling of wanting to explode and fill the void with the screech of our own inner turmoils , but lack the voice , the means , the mechanisms . for want of a method we seeth silently , voiceless , castrated , invisible . we want to be known and loved and understood and instead we stammer and stutter and fall silent . we pack in our caring and seal our emotions and vulnerabilities behind high walls of rationality and apathy . or we scribble in diaries or blogs and our hidden solitary torture goes wholly unnoticed . caouette has commendably captured in video and audio snippets , in stills and captions , a glimpse into the troubled past that haunts and harasses him . he has undertake a photo collage of his own life experience , himself as the subject matter and the material . i can not know how much he left on the cutting room floor , what he felt necessary or desireable to expunge , but he seems to have faced it all with remarkable candor and vulnerability . he survived a rural southern upbringing , a father-less household , poverty , a love of film , and homosexuality . to that potent melange , he added mental illness , abandonment , foster care , pcp , physical and sexual abuse . i can not say that i understand his life even after viewing it or that i can even relate to some of the events that shaped him . but through his art i feel that i can say i know a little of him and i can say that i empathize with his pain . i will never walk a mile in his shoes , but i do n't think i have to in order to care about the tribulations and fate of another human being . it is his candor and vulnerability , his willingness to expose the deepest parts of his own psyche and say `` here i am , look at me . '' that makes me care about him . that gives me a reason to watch and wonder , how did he turn out ? seeing the first half of the project , one would be forgiven for thinking `` this will end badly . '' that one of these stark text captions will announce his successful suicide and provide that closing parenthesis to his life : jonathan caouette ( 1975 - 200x ) . ultimately , i think he redeemed himself and perhaps transcended his lot in life . what i saw as the film continued was a man coming to terms with himself and his past . a man demonstrating that he is capable of finding love and connecting with others . a man who did not harbor resentments for the wrongs done to him and his mother , did not harbor a grudge toward his father or grandparents for abandonment or abuse . rather , i saw a thoughtful , emotional , caring man , a creative artist , a loving partner and a devoted son . his journey is not yet complete , but as the film concluded , i felt a compassion and a sense of optimism , for not just jonathan , but for all of us .
