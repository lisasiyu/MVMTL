what the italian family is all about ( my copy is a region 2 , european version ) . a masterpiece by italian director lucino visconti . intense , emotional , realistic , passionate , dramatic story of an italian family from the poor south ( lucania ) who immigrates to the northern city of napoli . a 3-hour film that , alternatively , focuses on each one of the sons of the 'mamma ' . if `` il gattopardo '' was the drama of the aristocratic italian family from the south , this one corresponds to the poor family also from the south . both are cinematic gems , worthy of being included among the best in film history . although a long film , its intensity never diminishes . every shot is full of emotion and meaningful and beautiful . the only thing that disappointed me a little was the way it ended , the last half-hour . it 's more of an open ending , no conclusion . one of the most gorgeous films in b/w that i 've seen . italy to the bones .
