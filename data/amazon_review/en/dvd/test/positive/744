the insider illustrates how 1 person can still make a huge positive difference a true story that 's still touching lives today & for the forseeable future too the insider tells the true story of how jeffrey wigand [ played by russell crowe ] told the world what the major tobacco companies knew and concealed about the dangers posed to consumers by their cigarettes . the insider is presented with tangible class and with an appropriately heavy docudrama feel . in my opinion , `` the insider '' is director michael mann 's best film to date and was nominated for seven academy awards . excellent acting by pacino , crowe and plummer . yes - there is a price to pay for being a whistleblower & it comes in many thankless forms ! ! ! ! ! the film 's setting is saturated with an eerie and believable atmosphere of paranoia . the sinking feeling that the unseen enemy [ the tobacco company ] will be coming from somewhere seems to be both infectious and believable throughout the film . the price wigand pays for his integrity is dear and continues to this day . his personal loss rivals the tobacco company 's but unlike them he consciously decided to do the `` right thing '' regardless of that cost . amplifying the significance of wigand 's whistle blowing decision , where in effect 1 man [ jeffrey wigand ] does stand up completely alone against the threats of big tobacco , cbs `` corporate '' caves in to the tobacco company 's lawsuit threats . after taping the interview cbs corporate hits the chicken switch over airing mike wallace 's interview with wigands much as the tobacco company had hoped the wistleblower would have . this subplot through analogy clearly demonstrates the power of one ordinary man against a powerful corrupt system and clearly illustrates how 1 person can still make a big difference . jeffrey wigand standing up to be counted did make a difference in this case . a huge difference ! yes - -1 person can make a difference : a big difference here ! on a smaller scale the filmakers ' effort here is another example of how 1 man can make a difference though the risk is far smaller . interestingly , though the film was nominated for 7 academy awards it came away with none . i guess whistleblowing for a just cause will still have to be its own reward . * -- * abridged list of the cast * -- * al pacino - lowell bergman russell crowe - jeffrey wigand christopher plummer - mike wallace diane venora - liane wigand philip baker hall - don hewitt lindsay crouse - sharon tiller debi mazar - debbie de luca stephen tobolowsky - eric kluster colm feore - richard scruggs bruce mcgill - ron motley rip torn - john scanlon lynne thigpen - mrs. williams nestor serrano - fbi agent robertson pete hamill - n.y. times reporter michael moore - michael moore * -- * abridged but extensive list of [ much awarded ] production crew * -- * michael mann - director / producer / screenwriter pieter jan brugge - producer marie brenner - short story author eric roth - screenwriter dante spinotti - cinematographer pieter bourke - composer ( music score ) lisa gerrard - composer ( music score ) graeme revell - composer ( music score ) william c. goldenberg - editor david rosenbloom - editor paul rubell - editor brian morris - production designer avi avivi - art director john kasarda - art director marjorie stone mcshirley - supervising art director james tocci - art director michael waxman - co-producer / first assistant director gusmano cesaretti - associate producer kathleen m. shea - associate producer lynn christopher - set designer nancy haigh - set designer kelly hannafin - set designer beth kushnick - set designer chris spellman - set designer darrell l. wight - set designer anna sheppard - costume designer doug hemphill - sound/sound designer andy nelson - sound/sound designer lee orloff - sound/sound designer bonnie timmerman - casting gregg baxter - sound editor gregory king - sound editor * -- * abridged list of major awards & nominations * -- * best actor ( nom ) russell crowe 1999 academy best adapted screenplay ( nom ) eric roth 1999 academy best adapted screenplay ( nom ) michael mann 1999 academy best cinematography ( nom ) dante spinotti 1999 academy best director ( nom ) michael mann 1999 academy best editing ( nom ) david rosenbloom 1999 academy best editing ( nom ) william c. goldenberg 1999 academy best editing ( nom ) paul rubell 1999 academy best picture ( nom ) 1999 academy best sound ( nom ) doug hemphill 1999 academy best sound ( nom ) lee orloff 1999 academy best sound ( nom ) andy nelson 1999 academy best cinematography ( nom ) dante spinotti 1999 american society of cinematographers best actor ( nom ) russell crowe 1999 british academy awards best actor ( win ) russell crowe 1999 broadcast film critics association best director- feature film ( nom ) michael mann 1999 directors guild of america best actor ( drama ) ( nom ) russell crowe 1999 golden globe best director ( nom ) michael mann 1999 golden globe best film ( drama ) ( nom ) 1999 golden globe best original score ( nom ) lisa gerrard 1999 golden globe best original score ( nom ) pieter bourke 1999 golden globe best screenplay ( nom ) eric roth 1999 golden globe best screenplay ( nom ) michael mann 1999 golden globe about the dvd : excellent sound and video but very short of features . 7 minute featurette is very inadequate for this type of film ! ! ! my take on `` the insider '' - - terrific film that sadly has not attracted as much attention from moviegoers as it deserves . pacino , crowe and plummer really do justice to this excellent example of a michael mann film .
