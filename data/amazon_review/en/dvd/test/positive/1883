not for everybody being a real star is n't anybody 's stuff ... whenever you catch something that 's too heavy for you , you 'll drop it . that 's what a man like mc queen never did until he became a living icon to many people of all ages , and managed to live with it . a few money helps , but still ... being still able to act and to be funny when you know you may be going to die within the next weeks , is another proof of how mentally strong a man can be . or maybe a bit `` unconscious '' too , as to perform what mc queen did in that film , assuming there was no fx in there ... having a funny line that reads `` puffing 's not my trick '' , when you only got one half lug left to breath with in the reality , also is a proof of a certain irresponsability , but that 's why an actor like mc queen was what he used to be , and why the public still likes him so much . thanks to mr legrand for having properly wasted the original soundtrack of steve mc queen 's last performance to the screen , when charles bernstein 's score serves the movie so well ... pick the french version if you want to check it out
