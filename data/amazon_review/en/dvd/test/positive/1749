interesting batch of curios . i must admit that i was reluctant to buy this set thinking `` oh no , not another batch of slapstick comedies '' but being the silent film completist that i am i purchased it . although i 'm glad i did , this set is primarily for hardcore silent film afficionados like myself . while there are a couple of offerings from chaplin and lloyd and single comedies from charley chase and stan laurel , the bulk of this 3 dvd set is devoted to lesser known comedians and in a couple of instances truly obscure ones . this would probably make american slapstick of little interest to the public at large . all of the films included here are taken from 16mm source materials and while many of the prints are in very good condition , they are not up to the standards set by earlier collections from kino and image entertainment although this title is being distributed by image . for the serious collector that is more than offset by the raritiy of some of the comedies in this collection . do the names eddie boland , perry murdock or frances lee ring a bell ? there are also complete versions of frequently excerpted shorts such as larry semon 's golf ( 1922 ) and the ton of fun 's heavy love ( 1926 ) . the snub pollard starring vehicle sold at auction ( 1923 ) is one of the more amazing silent offerings i 've ever seen complete with an astonishing array of imaginative camera tricks . the set is worth it for this comedy alone although billy bevan 's lizzies of the field ( great title ! ) from 1924 is not far behind . final assessment : american slapstick features an interesting batch of curios from long forgotten or up and coming comedians in mostly good condition with suitable musical accompaniment provided by three different performers . a must for diehard fans of silent comedy but not the ideal set to start off with
