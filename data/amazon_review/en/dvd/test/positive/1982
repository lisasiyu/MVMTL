clint is the man in joe kidd this is one of my favorite eastwood movies and what clint said is the perfect western . in typical stoic fashion eastwood outsmarts , outshoots and out-cools the badguys at every turn . i put this one somewhere just below the good the bad and the ugly , but higher than eastwoods recent work like unforgiven where he seems to have lost his moral compass and confidence
