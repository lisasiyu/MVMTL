fun for me - not for others ? this movie was made for anyone who ever went to summer camp . it takes all the ridiculous things that happen and exaggerate them about 6842673 times . i personally enjoyed it thoroughly , but for those of you who do n't spend 6 weeks out of your summer at camp , it might not be as appealing
