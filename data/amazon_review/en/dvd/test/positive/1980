preplay-review revised i have n't played this game yet , but from everything that i 've seen i want to . i am writing this in reply to one of the others writing a review , and to let someone who wants this and decides not to get it because of their review . he said is was short and had a weird ending . thats because it 's not the ending . if you notice it 's call sin episodes . there are going to be about seven of them . what 's great is that , if you get injured , it will carry over to the next one . if you have n't deleted you save games .
