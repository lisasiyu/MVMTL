worth one 's time the personality of the main character , dr. house , is a breather from having to be pc all the time and it based on the notion of being brutally honest . that the main character does not make allowances for diplomacy is based on the notion that he has no time for stupidity . therefore some people find house tiring and overly caustic , but it makes for great entertainment . the medical info is always challenging and i enjoy googling it afterwards . the series is one of the more intelligent ones on tv and one can actually learn from it
