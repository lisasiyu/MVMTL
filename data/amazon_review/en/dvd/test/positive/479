sturges at his best years ago , in the days before cable , there were six or seven television stations in chicago . only a few of them had programming late at night . there were n't channels to flip between ; when you found a movie you liked , you actually watched it . one weekend night , i came home late and found my sister watching the late-late show on wgn . `` the miracle of morgan 's creek '' had just started and we had never seen anything quite like it . a good sturges movie is as close as you can get to a rollercoaster ride without going to an amusement park . and this movie is as wild a ride as any sturges movie . i have seen this movie a number of times over the last 30 years and each time i am almost doubling over with laughter . i ca n't wait to get it on dvd . for a few years in the 1940s preston sturges was a brilliant shinning star . as far as i am concerned , he never shone brighter than he did in this `` miracle .
