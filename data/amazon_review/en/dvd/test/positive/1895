thank you fox ! finally being released on dvd this movie is great fun ! betty grable is absolutely stunning as is carole landis and very good suporting cast as well as great costumes , lovely sets and gorgeous technicolor make this musical a delight . i 've practically worn out my tape and now at last it is being released on dvd as part of the betty grable collection . now let 's see more great fox musicals of the forties released ! ! `` moon over miami '' is a remake of an earlier ( non musical ) called `` three blind mice '' 1938 staring loretta young , joel mccrea and david niven . it is also enjoyable if you can find it .
