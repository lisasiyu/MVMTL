funny movie `` meatballs '' is bill murray 's movie . he makes it work . from beginning to end he gives us a non-stop stream of funny lines and crazy antics . i believe we 're seeing him ( murray ) at his peak here . he 's not funny at all these days , but back in the 70s he was the funniest person in the entertainment industry , and in `` meatballs '' he is at the top of his game . i would pick bill murray ( at his peak ) over tom hanks , eddie murphy , or robin williams . the story ... your basic summer camp situation ... is brought to life and made hilarious . bill leads the way , but he does get some help . the supporting cast is actually pretty good . they were well chosen for their respective roles , and are believable and likable . chris makepeace , the `` short depressed kid we ordered '' is very effective as the sensative camper who is shunned by the other campers . jack blum , as spaz , is excellent . i think the creation of the spaz character is a stroke of movie genius , and jack makes the part work ... making me wonder if maybe he is that way in real life . kristine debell is very nice as the counselor a.l . ... very likable . bill murray handles the funny guy role ( who is actually a caring guy ) with ease . his scenes with chris makepeace are very real , very touching ... and , whether he wanted to or not , bill gave quite a bit of depth to the tripper character . the humor does , at times , cross over the line into questionable taste . for some reason though , when bill murray makes a dirty joke , we are not offended . it 's as if we know he 's only bluffing and is not really that way . personally , i think his clean material is better than that stuff , but if we want bill murray , i guess we have to take the whole package ... and we get a wide variety of humor here . but the movie is funny and entertaining ... beginning to end . and it holds up well under repeated viewing .
