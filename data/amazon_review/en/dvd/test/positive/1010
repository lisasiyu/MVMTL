this mob film has it all christopher walken is a former organized crime figure that gets kidnapped by a group of preppies that hold him for ransom . ( this happens right up front in the story so i 'm not giving anything away ) . the kidnappers realistically come off as bungling amateurs . walken 's presence is overwhelming ( even duct taped to a chair ) and he looms large over the whole story . great perfomance . throughout the film , the viewer keeps anticipating , `` somebody is going to really get hurt here '' . they do , of course . the story has plenty of mystery and multiple twists . there are gruesome execution and mutilation scenes . it has laugh out loud comedy - special mention to denis leary and his `` stingray boots '' . he plays a thug and is appropriately menacing and crude , but he is genuinely funny . . . even while brutally beating a man with a golf club . the r rating is appropriate . a well written and directed film . camera work a little unimaginative . good sound . if you are ok with the violence , you are guaranteed an entertaining experience with this film .
