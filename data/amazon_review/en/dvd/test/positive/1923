if you love livvy ... .. ok , so this movie was a flop ... story is kind of silly , but if you love onj like i do , you will enjoy this ! livvy is beautiful as always in this movie and her music was great too ! yeah , i agree with the other reviews , it is a `` hall of shamer '' but , us die-hard onj fans still like watching her !
