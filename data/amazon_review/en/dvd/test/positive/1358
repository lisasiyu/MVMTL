great ! i 'm married to a spanish man and have always wanted to learn the dances from his culture . granted , the dances on this dvd are a lot more americanized than the actual thing at times , but i can definitely keep up now . each dance is broken down and repeated a lot of times -- they teach the men 's steps 3 or 4 times , as well as the women 's steps , and then both men and women together , then they finally do it quickly to put it all together . so if you 're someone who needs to see it a lot before you get it , this is perfect . the only funny thing is that the teachers speak with this british-like accent , which i would n't expect for a latin theme , but hey it 's still great . the music is even good . and it 's definitely a workout . this was worth my money , most definitely
