entertaining and smart `` the thomas crown affair '' is a remake of an older film i 've never seen and stars the former james bond , pierce brosnan as the title character . this is the perfect role for brosnan , because he 's better suited as a smart and sophisticated millionaire than an action hero . the movie is smart , plausible , entertaining , and the performances are very suave . as i said , brosnan plays thomas crown ; a millionaire who 's life really is n't very fun ... so , crown decides to steal a painting from a museum that 's worth 100 million dollars . crown , however , is not stealing the painting for what it 's worth but merely for the excitement of doing it . the actual theft of the painting is really entertaining and pretty damned plausible . after he steals the painting , the cops begin investigating as well as an insurance investigator named catherine banning ( rene russo ) , who 's willing to do anything to find this painting . one thing crown longs for ( as it 's explained in his therapy sessions ) is a female equal to himself and catherine has enough determination and smarts to fill that . well , eventually crown and catherine begin an affair ( and i must say , that for a woman in her forties russo looks incredible ) that appears to be only about sex . neither one of them are entirely sure if they can trust one another . comedian denis leary ( 'rescue me ' & 'jesus ' son ' ) plays michael , a detective working on the case along with catherine . but , brosnan and russo really light up the screen . they play the characters better than anybody i could think of and they actually have charisma on screen , which makes it all the more better . this movie is n't a masterpiece but it is entertaining and exciting and worth watching . grade : a-
