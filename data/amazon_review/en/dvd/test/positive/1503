carmen jones i first saw this film when it premiered back in the mid-fifties . i remember wondering why there were no white people in it . i was very young at the time and not living in the us and was not privee to the political climate here . i waited to see this film a second time and saw a 'cut up ' version on tv in the 60 's . despite its condition and the breaks for mindless commercials , the film was still entertaining and carmen was dazzling . the film seemed to 'disappear ' after that until the 1980 's when i saw a showing at the public theatre in new york city - bless mr. papp for screeing it . over the years , i have seen many operas and now know how 'grand opera ' is presented . still , i think that this is a valant effort and is worth seeing . the lyrics are great and worthy of the music . ms dainbridge remains excellent as carmen and was certainly was sexy , as carmen should be - unlike so many that have played the part in grand opera ! one can sympathize with the young soldier going awal . the one oddity is hearing someone else 's voice coming from harry belefonte 's mouth . this film is definitely worth seeing
