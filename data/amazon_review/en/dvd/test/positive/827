this is what great looks like from the original steinbeck story to the horton foote screen adaptation to the lush cinematography and amazing performances , gary sinise 's of mice and men is film perfection . there is a terrible sense of inevitability present from the very beginning of this film ; we know that fate will not be kind to lennie . but despite his slow march to tragedy we are transfixed by the elegant simplicity of the telling . sinise uses his knowledge of theatre to pare this classic story to the bone . malkovich , always willing to get lost in a part no matter how bizarre or extreme , does n't act lennie , he inhabits him . watching his childlike behavior and listening to his repetitive monologues we understand completely why george loves him as he does and simultaneously finds him thoroughly maddening . malkovich owns this role for all time , i feel badly for every actor attempting it from now on . extreme roles , like lennie , allow actors lots of room to show off while simultaneously providing margin for error . sinise , as george , has the hardest duty and comes through with a quiet performance that is nothing short of stunning . every aspect of his complex relationship with lennie is revealed almost inadvertently , hope , bitterness , anger , protectiveness , and pride to name just a few . as director he has stitched together all the elements of this film into an organic whole , no false notes . as director directing himself he simply inserts his own performance into a complete vision , his embodiment of george is generous - not self-serving . the brilliance of malkovich and sinise should not obscure a host of wonderful supporting performances . ray walston ( my favorite martian ) is excellent , joe morton is terrific as always , casey siemaszko brings real malevolence as only he can , john terry is thoroughly believable as a crew boss , and sherilyn fenn is exactly on point as the player who loses control of the game . simply put , of mice and men is what happens on those rare occasions when absolutely everything goes right .
