amazing workout once again , adam ford amazes me with his skills and knowledge with the swiss ball . if you purchased any of his other workout dvds , you will not be disappointed with this volume . once again , he breaks the workout in three levels . trust me , start with the easiest level and work your way up to the hardest . his exercises are extremely difficult to do , but the payoff is amazing . you will gain functional strength and stabilty control like you would n't believe . i 've been workout for years , using different modality , ( e.g . bands , free weights , calisthetics , cable machines , medicine balls , bosu , stability balls ) and i thought i could manage the hardest level ... not ! ! ! i tried one of the harder exercises and almost fell on my face . take my word for it , this will make a great addition to anyone 's workout library and for anyone who might be bored with their current workouts and want to change things up alittle
