one of the best ! ! i love this movie . for those who love romance , fantasy , knighthood , gallantry , and all that , this is your thing . one reason i love it is that don quixote must have read ( ! ) the saying , `` when you tell a man he is brave , you are helping him to become so . '' the don , this mad-man , sees nothing but the beautiful and pure in the whore aldonza , and despite her violent rejection of his view of her and the name `` dulcinea '' that he gives her , she eventually realizes his purity of mind and begins to think maybe there is something worthwhile in her after all . thus , she becomes , slowly , as he envisions her . that to me is thrilling . and , i heartily disagree with those reviewers who object to the voices of peter o'toole ( dubbed ) and sophia loren . sure , they are n't the best , but taking the don 's for instance ; if his voice had been any better , it would have been 'way out of character for the `` knight of the woeful countenance . '' and a shirley jones voice would not have been convincing for the whore aldonza , to my way of thinking . to me , they were both perfect for their parts . cummon , let 's be realistic ! if you want perfect voices , watch `` carousel '' etc . this movie is inspirational , touching , exciting , and one i watch many times , getting a thrill out of it each time . am ordering the dvd with captions , as i do n't want to miss one word !
