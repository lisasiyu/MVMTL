who needs extras ? ? these films stand on their own as great films and great examples of demille 's unique brand of film making . they do n't need 'extra features ' to hype them . i was also glad to see the inclusion of 'four frightened people ' which is quite different from demille 's usual epic style . the packaging of the set is actually quite good , with single-sided disks and an attractive slip case . the film quality is excellent , considering the fact that these films are over 70 years old . overall , an outstanding collection at a relatively reasonable price .
