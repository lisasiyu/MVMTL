purchase with confidence if you 're thinking of buying this collection , chances are that you 're most interested in f.w . murnau 's 1927 silent masterpiece sunrise . ( for whatever reasons fox may have , this is currently the only official way to get hold of the sunrise dvd . ) my review is mainly aimed at those folks , so i 'll try to answer the question : is it worth buying the other three to get sunrise ? short answer : definitely ! fox 's dvd transfer of sunrise , which is an upgrade from an earlier laserdisc release , is superb . no kidding , it 's actually comparable to the best current transfers of silent films , like kino 's metropolis , wb 's chaplins , and criterion 's passion of joan of arc . considering that any of those titles would cost you about what you 'll pay for this whole collection , you 've got to figure that you 're getting a pretty good deal . long answer : i actually believe that two of the other three films here are masterpieces in their own right . how green was my valley , which has unjustly been labelled as the film that `` stole '' best picture from citizen kane , ranks among john ford 's best efforts ; it 's a genuinely beautiful , though an admittedly sentimental , film . and it 's one of those movies that received a solid restoration a few years ago -- back when amc actually showed good movies and took a hand in these sorts of projects . all about eve , of course , needs no introduction . i find it a tad too long , but i agree that it has one of the best scripts ever written and some fantastic performances . it has finally received a full restoration from fox -- all the speckles are gone ( though some of the image 's sharpness has gone , too ) . gentleman 's agreement , on the other hand , is one of those movies that 's easier to admire for its aims than for its entertainment value or aesthetics . it has dated badly , and fox 's lack of restoration work is n't likely to get it rediscovered any time soon . so my opinion is that you get three great films ( and one of historical interest ) for a very reasonable price . each title comes with quite a few extras , if that matters to you -- though here again i think sunrise benefits from the most informative and interesting extras , including a semi-reconstruction of one of murnau 's `` lost '' films . highly recommened
