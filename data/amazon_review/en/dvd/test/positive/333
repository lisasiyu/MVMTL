interesting in that ... creepy kind of way . john hawkes is richard swersey , a recently separated shoe salesman and father of two boys , in this story of just a few of life 's most basic , yet complicated relationships . richard struggles with the separation from his wife until he meets christine , an eccentric artist who does n't starve only because she chauffeurs the elderly . richard 's sons find love , one conversationally on the internet , and the other physically from the neighborhood girls who want to experiment with him . the movie was written and directed by miranda july who also starred in the film as christine . i thought it was good , but not great . i loved the incorporation of the name of the movie into the theme of the story . i thought that was great . i enjoyed the well-written dialogue . it was certainly an interesting film , just not the most entertaining . some parts of the movie seemed to move too slowly , though i can appreciate that , to an extent , it was done on purpose ( see also : artistically ) . the movie received some pretty harsh reviews from family and friends , but i am happy i still took the time to see it . i had hoped to catch it in the theater , but was glad to finally see it once and for all on dvd .
