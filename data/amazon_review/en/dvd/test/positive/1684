elvis lives i 'm a big elvis fan and when i saw this on tv i thought it was great and had to have it . the way they produced this film was great . you felt like it was a live show with elvis . the way they jelled the past with the present was fanstatic . a must have for any one who is a fan of elvis , or someone just getting started .
