character and honor top notch acting through a difficult subject . the loss of hope through capture , torture and betrayal in the face of brutal circumstances is the crucible in which true honor and self sacrifice rise to the surface . this prisoner of war movie , slated to release too close to 9/11 , finally reached the public without fan fare and is one of the most powerful depictions of honor and true humility available today . when some of the prisoners are inspired to teach and study and redeem the time by sharing their gifts and talents , hope finds its way into the hearts of the prisoners once again . they now have something to live for , to look forward to at the end of the work day , and their `` awakening '' causes their captors to permit expansion ( espeacially since their productivity increases ) . ultimately , their honorable ways are admired ( even if privately ) by their enemies , who lack the compassion necessary to be truly honorable themselves
