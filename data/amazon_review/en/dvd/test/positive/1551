good hong kong police film i would have preferred to have seen this film in it 's original mandarin language track but i do not feel it is necessary to knock this edition . i also take the unfashionable opinion that `` reservoir dogs '' , quentin tarantino 's homage ( not rip-off ) to `` city on fire '' , is the better of the two films . `` reservoir dogs '' beats this film in terms of style and characterization if not completely original . that said , this is a highly engaging film . it has a compelling central premise of a police undercover operative who not only has to fear the crooks he 's infiltrating but his superiors who view him with contempt . there is action here for sure but it does n't subvert the story . i recommend this film for any fan of hong kong action films but if a mandarin edition becomes available check that out instead
