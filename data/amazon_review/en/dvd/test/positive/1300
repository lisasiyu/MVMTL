a true treat for any doris day fan ! to finally be able to see this terrific doris day variety show in all it 's restored color and fantastic sound was something to behold ! day looks and sings like a dream and it 's just ashame that she did not do more of these types of shows at this point in her career . the highlights for me were to be able to view the show without the laugh track ... .you could really enjoy the music ... .and of course ... .day 's 70 's redition of her big hit sentimental journey ... .do n't think she has ever sung better
