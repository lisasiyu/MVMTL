great workout this is a very fast paced workout . it took a couple of times through to learn the routine . denise does n't cue all that well . she 's very upbeat and energetic and constantly gives words of encouragement . most people do n't like that about her , but i think she is motivating . you definitely work all muscle groups and you 'll be sweating with this workout . i 'm tired , but invigorated by the end . i enjoyed this workout a lot
