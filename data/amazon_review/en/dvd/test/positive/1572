great fun , great workout ! my baby and i just love this dvd . the dances are simple to learn , but they really burn off the baby fat . there is a good variety of music which is nice if we 're in a particular mood- no excuses for not exercising ! i also like that there are so many songs , giving us something to build up to ; my baby and i still ca n't quite make it through all the dances . this dvd really makes exercise challenging and fun while bonding with my new baby- exactly what every new mommy needs
