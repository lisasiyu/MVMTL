watch with your best girlfriend ... i took my best friend to see this ( second run ) in an small , artsy theatre in san francisco . it was so vivid and colorful ... very interesting to watch . i found myself following the storyline without having to focus solely on the subtitles . as a result , i could appreciate the landscapes , the costumes , the hidden innuendos ... all the first time around . this movie is definitely for those that can truly appreciate the pure essence and beauty of female friendship . there is a scene near the end when the uppity , seemingly prudish momoko staunchly defends and protects her rough-around-the-edges biker friend , ichigo that made us want to cheer . as the end credits rolled , the small audience broke into applause . afterwards , we raved incessantly about how much we collectively loved it
