utterly amazing thriller ! wow ! this movie really exceeded my expectations . unfortunately , this movie does not get the credit it so much deserves . berry put one of her best performances into this film . the plot is superb , the scenes are very convincing , and the plot-twist at the end is brilliant ! this movie is much better than your average thriller and one of my favorites that i have seen in the past few years . this movie is void of predictability or any formulaic format , which makes it such a refreshing thriller . do n't listen to the negative reviews on this film , they do n't know what they 're talking about ! remember : if you see this movie with a friend , make sure you can hold on tight to him/her because you 'll need someone
