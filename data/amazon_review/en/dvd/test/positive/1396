a must see movie ioan gruffud is horatio hornblower , to a fault-even as a lean , mean sea captain . his shocking good looks make him an instant hit . but blimey ! he marries his landlady 's daughter maria ? i half expected the bloke to marry a demure lovely keira knightley type . his ladylove is at least 8 years his senior , and perhaps this explains his desperation to return to the briny deep ! besides ioan , another hero in this movie is greg wise -- as a french turncoat his acting was stupendous . good job greg
