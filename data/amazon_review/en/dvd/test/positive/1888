superb series i enjoyed hawaii five-o as a schoolboy decades ago on a black and white tv , and it is a real pleasure to see it in a crisp clear colour version on dvd . one thing that made this series so good ( as i now see ) was that , apart from being set in 'paradise ' , as its worthy successor magnum p.i . would be , there was no set formula for the stories ; the variety is constantly surprising . the two-part story of how mcgarrett deals with a person claiming to cure cancer by an electronic gadget is one i remember from childhood . the series ( and dvd ) have been so well made that it easy to forget that what we see on screen was filmed over three decades ago . i suppose 'paradise ' never ages or gets dull . i look forward to the whole series coming out on dvd , the sooner , the better ! highly recommended
