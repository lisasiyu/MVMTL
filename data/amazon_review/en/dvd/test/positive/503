unbelievable , but enjoyable yep , it 's another romantic comedy ... with a twist . enter an account exec who , thru an accident w/ a hairdryer at home can hear women 's thoughts . this is a pure bunk , pure enjoyment film .. and mel gibson addresses it with style . while the film may not win any big awards , it 's great fun to watch again and again . and i 'm not one who 's big on romance comedies . want to grin and chuckle thru the evening ? give this one a look . suitable for the whole family , but it 's likely that kids under 12 will find it boring . recommended . ~ p
