great dvd for aspiring cheerleaders . i am a former cheerleader and cheerleading coach and really enjoy this dvd . i bought it for my young daughter and loaned it out to some of my cheerleaders when coaching . it teaches the basics : the motions and what they 're called , some cheers and chants , and one really fun dance routine . it also goes a little bit into what it means to be a cheerleader for your school and what will be expected of you and the code of conduct that you 'll be expected to follow . it does not go into jumps or stunting at all . the stunting is definitely something cheerleaders do n't want to learn from a dvd , but i was disappointed that they did n't teach any jumps . another reviewer somewhere else , a former cheerleader , gave this dvd low marks because she expected to get a good workout from it and relive the good-old-days . let me just point out to everyone , this is an instructional dvd for beginners . it 's not a workout dvd and it 's not for cheerleaders that already have a lot of cheer experience . also , the organization that put this dvd together is the uca , one of the biggest cheer-instruction organizations out there . they 've been conducting cheer clinics all over the country for many years . other cheer organizations do some motions differently or have different names for them . there is no right or wrong way , but aspiring cheerleaders should know this in case they make it on a squad coached by someone trained by one of the other groups . always follow your coach 's instructions and do n't challenge him or her with these differences . one more word of advice for aspiring cheerleaders : unless you live in a very rural , small town with a small student population and are sure there wo n't be much competition at try-outs , take gymnastic classes . cheerleading has become very athletic and competitive . to increase your chances in the more populated areas , you will need tumbling skills . dance classes - especially hip-hop - would n't hurt either . yoga - to increase balance and flexability - would help a lot , too . good luck
