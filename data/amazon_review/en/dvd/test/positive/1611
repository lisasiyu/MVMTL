honor blackman ? no , the exquisite honor blackman ! watching honor blackman as cathy gale makes one thing clear : i was born a half-century too late . why ca n't i find a girl like that ? anyway , this set of early avengers episodes is really most valuable ( to me ) because it 's the genesis of the cathy gale years , which is where the avengers begin for me . the episodes are certainly crude compared to later episodes during the emma peel years , but they nonetheless possess their own raw power that the more polished shows somehow lacked . the lack of retakes gives the acting a rough , natural edge that serves the more serious ( by avengers standards ) scripts quite well . for fans of the later , more famous avengers episodes , these early shows can serve as both an embellishment of the avengers ' quirky sense of adventure and a counterpoint to the more whimsical nature of latter years . recommended
