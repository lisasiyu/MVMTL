not as bad as some of these reviews say i 've seen all 3 cube movies , and although this is not the best of the 3 it is a good movie . the theory behind a hypercube ( yes they exisit in mathematical theory ) is accurate and suprisingly all the equations that are written out are acutal formule and equations for hypercubes . and that adds to this movies mystique . true the 1st movie was far better . this movie explores more about the charactes though . each character had either was connected with the hypercube or was placed in it for a specific task
