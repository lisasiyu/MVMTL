party hardy with bear this dvd contains three episodes of `` bear in the big blue house . '' the first two have a birthday party theme . the final one does n't really anything to do with a party , but it is still rocking . the fun starts with `` mouse party '' when our friends in the big blue house put together a surprise party for tutter the mouse . the viewer is asked to keep the secret as they prepare the party - putting together the decorations , making the cake and keeping tutter in the dark . tutter considers the fact that he 's getting older and finally , viewers rock to `` happy , happy birthday '' when the time comes for tutter 's big party . next comes `` bear 's birthday bash . '' this is an episode that recalls `` mouse party '' in many ways , except this time it 's bear who 's having the birthday . he 'd like to have a nice , relaxing day , but the kids of the big blue house decide to throw him a surprise party . finally , `` dancin ' the day away '' finds everyone in the big blue house having some fun with dance . tutter , however , does n't think that he can dance , but pip and pop show him that he really can . this is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable characters and stories . my favorites are tutter and ojo ( and the big old bear himself ) , but they 're all wonderful . this dvd includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs
