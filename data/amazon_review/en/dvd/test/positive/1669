really grows on you i consider myself goth , even though i generally have to keep it hidden . i only mention this because i expected to really love this immediately ! i was disappointed when i did n't fall for it right off the bat , but i did myself a supreme favor by watching it again . this is a jewel and has a lot to offer , but the caveat is that it might not be instantly accessible . that 's good , though , right ? ? who wants the same rehashed stuff over and over ? my initial disappointments were , first , that the music was n't `` belly dance traditional '' and in some cases not even belly dance at all , but it was just an expectations problem . the music on this dvd ranges from modern arabic percussion/synth/vocal and modern ethnic/ modern bellydance to modern urban/ modern urban bellydance and techno . my second disappointment was that the dancers ' movements were unexpectedly slow , so that after the first 2 or 3 pieces i was so bored that i started fast-forwarding and then gave up completely . it turned out i needed a bit of time to `` recalibrate '' myself ! when i purchased this dvd , i had never seen rachel brice or sharon kihara perform yet , and did not know anything about the tribal style or what to expect from goth bellydancing . if you are looking for strictly bellydancing , you should know that i would label 10 of the 20 pieces such . i would label 6 as a blend of belly and modern , 3 as strictly modern , and 1 as a pretty worthless music video trashy piece . some specifics : ariellah is very engaging and talented , very enjoyable to watch , with excellent taste in costuming . her pieces are my favorites . i also enjoyed asharah 's dances and costumes . she is talented and only slightly less engaging than ariellah . ayshe 's work to me is heavy on atmospherics and drama , with more gymnastics , jazz , and ballet than bellydance . blanca exudes confidence but her dancing ability was hard to gauge because most of what dancing there is reminds me of what would be done in a go-go cage . the piece , which cuts between 2 locations and outfits , is visually a pretty piece nonetheless . jehan 's piece is too overtly sexual and , frankly , silly to me . her buttocks are barely hidden behind filmy fabric in some shots , and she writhes on the floor in others . more like a music video than anything else . neon 's piece `` deja vu '' at least has bellydancing in it , but is also very mtv . her costume is very cool , as is her nordic queen look and extensive tribal tattooing . there are 3 duets . one i have labeled `` goth bellydance meets riverdance '' with a touch of martial arts . it is very charmingly performed and entertaining , even funny at first , and the costumes are very pretty . this duet and one solo have knives in them , and one other duet begins as a mock execution with one of the women wielding a large sword . it took a couple views to begin warming up to that one . all this said , i strongly recommend this dvd . the women are mostly talented , many of the dances are creative and different , and the costuming is interesting and lovely in almost all cases . in addition , as someone herself learning bellydancing , i feel the camera work is very good . i was never annoyed by it , nor did i ever have trouble understanding what the dancers were doing . my only complaint is that i would wish to see the costumes in even greater detail because i am working on designing one or two for myself , but more light would , of course , have ruined the atmospherics . : ) in summary , i 'd venture that only the very jaded or very midwestern will be disappointed if you give this an honest chance . blink your eyes . rub them . walk away . come back another day and watch it again . this dvd seems glacially slow the first time you see it , compared to the usual , more frenetic belly dancing we 've all seen . as inexpensive as it is , i strongly suggest taking a chance on it if you like goth fashion/ colors/ atmospherics and various bellydance forms , such as the tribal style and other modern styles . i 'm very happy with it
