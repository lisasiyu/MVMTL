interesting review of suppressed information commander x is the pseudonym used by a person who is reportedly a former u.s. government intelligence agent from the nsa who worked in a remote viewing project . he has distributed a lot of information from alleged personal experiences and insider contacts to provide glimpses of what goes on behind the scenes with ets , the global elite/nwo , mind control , secret technologies , and more . probably the best part of this video is x 's expressed view that we all are connected to the creator and do n't need any religion to intermediate . the video shows scenes of the speaker with his face blacked out , interspersed with a variety of video clips , photos , fractal and kaleidoscopic art , metaphysical drawings , and more . the voice is altered and it 's almost a cliche that the speaker is upsetting folks in the government/nwo by sharing what he knows . obviously , if information is classified then those who have taken an oath to serve government agencies can be dealt with in unpleasant ways for releasing what they have discovered . thus , i think it is unusual for people like x to directly present their findings to the public unless it is being done openly as an approved leak or dissemination of confusing disinfo . the speaker here is disguised [ though it would seem to me that it might not be too hard for the government to identify him and track him down ] . he admits that he does n't have all the answers and seems to be a bit more calm than some other people that have presented their ideas about ets & nwo topics . overall i thought this video was interesting , though i found the organization of images presented to be inadequate at times even while i really liked many of the computer generated fractal , kaleidoscopic , and hypnotic images . this video seems to present information in a more cogent and up-to-date manner than past commander x books , so if you liked the books this video should interest you
