great classic ! this wonderful classic is worth watching again and again . my sixteen year old son watched it for the first time and was very impressed ( a pleasant surprise-since he 's not hip on old movies ) . he thought the film would be so out of date as far as stunts , special effects , etc . that he 'd be bored to tears , but this film has stood up to the test of time , perhaps because it was ahead of its time . i never get tired of watching o'toole 's performance as the brash , impressionable young lawrence who strives to help keep arabia in the hands of the arabs , despite the wishes of his british commanders . at one point lawrence develops a 'god complex ' , only to be brought back to the reality that he 's just and ordinary man with weaknesses . this realization does n't stop him from attempting to do something extraordinary ... chrissy k. mcvay - autho
