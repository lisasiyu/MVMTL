inspirational as a theology student , as a citizen , and as a human being the movie touched me at every level . the transformation story of archbishop romero is not only about an individual hero but touches upon what it means for a church to have a human face . what role a church must play when caught between politics and violence . it is relevant to us today as we face a new global hegemony . the people around the world are being exploited in the name of capitalism and democracy . while , we , the fat americans stand by and watch in indifference the people suffering ? some 2 billion people who makes less than a $ 1/day . will we rise up ? will we open our eyes and to see the plight of the majority of humanity outside the boundaries of united states ? who will speak for them ? who will hear their cries ? may i be as courageous as archbishop romero in speaking the truth and to confront the systems of power and indifference .
