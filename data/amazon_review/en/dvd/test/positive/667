an interesting look at the broadway wet dream this musical is about wanting to get out of the life you live . in the case of shirley maclaine 's character , it 's about her finally trying to stop compromising on her ideals of love and quit her hypocritical ( hypocritical considering her remarks about truly believing in love ) job as a dancehall hostess . in addition to conversely demonstrating the shallow nature of the broadway musical dream and how even love can seem insincere on a grand lofty scale , they also inject these ideas with quirky humor which distracts from just how insipid these characters would seem if played straight . the funny thing about this film is that it is both a satire and completely honest in it 's depiction of life . it also contains excellent choreography and music whose flash demonstrates the appeal of such things . depicting all of these differing and seemingly contradictory thoughts makes the viewer not know how they feel about the whole thing . personally , after the film was over i was left with the callow sense of whimsy and was amazed at how willing i was to be entertained by this . apparently the stage version has a different ending so i hope that at some point i 'll be able to see it
