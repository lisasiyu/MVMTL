battling alcoholism , battling a disability , and battling an incarcerated outlaw 's determined friends the three parts of the title of this review illustrate the three main conflicts in this classic western . the main conflict is this : an accused criminal ( burdette ) is held in jail on the orders of sheriff chance ( john wayne ) . burdette 's many friends attempt several times to spring burdette from jail . the setting is texas sometime after the alamo , and there is a significant hispanic flavor in this western . the following information is provided for those viewers concerned about the levels of violence in films . this western includes a great deal of shooting , and there are actual scenes of people dead and dying of gunshot wounds . in addition , dynamite is used as a weapon . dude , an under-sheriff of sorts , had experienced personal tragedies in the recent past , and became a hard-core alcoholic . burdette 's men refer to him with contempt , calling him as a barfly . throughout this flick , dude tries to free himself from the bottle . a number of scenes show him trembling from withdrawal symptoms ( d. t. , delirium tremens ) . at one point , his hands become so unsteady from the d. t. that he wants to quit his job . in spite of his best efforts , he is about to drink again . but he pours the alcohol back into the bottle , demonstrating at this point both his mastery over alcoholism and the renewed steadiness of his hands , indicative of the passing of his d. t. but the conflict continues . alcoholism is so insidious . is dude actually victorious over his alcoholism , or will he break down and drink again ? i will not spoil the ending by revealing it . stumpy , another under-sheriff of sorts , is assigned to guard the jail . sheriff chance does not want stumpy engaged in gunfights because the latter walks with a limp , and would probably be a liability in a gunfight . but stumpy resents his subsidiary role , and longs for the action . will stumpy remain relegated to the sidelines , or will he see a part of the action ? see the film . burdette 's friends resort to several ploys in order to free burdette from jail . at one point , they capture dude and use him as a hostage . they want to exchange him for burdette . sheriff chance , having other ideas , agrees to this exchange . will dude be safely returned ? and will burdette go free ? again , i will not spoil the ending by revealing it .
