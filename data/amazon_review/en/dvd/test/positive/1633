a differnt bat this show just works . solid character development and interaction , catchy tunes ( the opener is fantastic ) , a new dark tech world of gotham and it stays true to the history established in batman : tas . but what really works is how differnt it is from batman in comics , movies , and the cartoons that began before it . terry ( the new batman ) who is still in high school becomes batman though to bruce he is still somewhat a sidekick like robin or batgirl . really that comment does n't describe the role terry plays . i can best describe him as a cross between batman , robin , and spider-man ( young high school version ) he 's dark and seeks revenge like batman , young , adventurous and very intuitive like robin and helpful , responsible but also often taking on too much as spider-man would . there is also the dynamic of family , nonexistant in previous batman animated adventures , he has to hide what he is really doing as batman from his friends , family and girlfriend , reminding me of peter parker 's relationship with mary and aunt may . villains are differnt too , i 'm glad the creators did n't just rehash enemies from the other series , though a few carry over , we do n't deal with a `` mad hatter beyond '' or `` penguin beyond '' , not that either are bad characters . again this series works , i have been waiting for years for this show to appear on dvd . nothing and no one can replace batman , but terry and this show provides a new hero that takes the name and theme of batman with a differnt approach
