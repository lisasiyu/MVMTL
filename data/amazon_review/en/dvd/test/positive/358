mrs. parker would be proud dorothy parker was a woman tragically ahead of her time . she wrote with real honesty and wit about what it felt like to be a woman in a man 's world , and her acerbic tongue became legendary . dorothy parker was also a lonely woman who was profoundly unhappy all her life , failed twice at marriage and suicide , and loved her friend and colleague robert benchley all her life , never acting on her desire for him . `` mrs. parker and the vicious circle '' does a wonderful job of depicting dorothy parker 's life on film . it shows parker young and vibrant in the 1920 's , which are filmed in color , and then slowly fading into alcoholism in the 30 's , 40 's , 50 's and 60 's . the latter sequences are shot in black and white , which is a fascinating way to structure the film . as the color drains from dorothy 's life , it drains from the screen as well . director alan rudolph , who also wrote the screenplay , does a wonderful job of evoking the period of new york and hollywood in the 20 's and 30 's . jennifer jason leigh is an extremely versatile actress , and she excels as dorothy parker . she looks , sounds , and acts so much like the real mrs. parker , especially in the scenes when she recites some of parker 's most autobiographical poetry . leigh plays dorothy as a woman who simply understood life too well , and was never able to be happy . when younger , she tried to be , but as the years roll on , you can see dorothy slowly giving up , finally allowing herself to be forgotten . in a pivotal scene towards the end of the film , a psychiatrist tells dorothy that she needs to face her pain more directly . tears rollong down her face , she replies `` face it more directly ? i face it every day . i fall in love with married men , but i do it purpose . i drink too much , but that 's because i 'm thirsty . i think my version of pain is more fun than yours . '' leigh gives a brave , intense performance as dorothy parker , and she deserved more recognition for her work than she got . campbell scott is also excellent as robert benchley , the fellow writer that dorothy loved . benchley was a married man , and the two never became intimate , although they loved each other deeply . `` mrs. parker and the vicious circle '' is not always an easy film to watch because it depicts a brilliant and vulnerable woman slowly drowning in her own unhappiness , with no hope that things will ever get better . in life , parker regarded herself a failure as a writer , and died alone and forgotten at the age of 74 . her one wish was to die on a cloudy , rainy day . true to her luck , on the day of her death the sun was shining
