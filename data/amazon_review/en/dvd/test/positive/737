they may be grandmothers to the `` desperate housewives , '' but have things really changed that much since the late forties ? this gem of a movie is a neglected classic of americana . `` a letter to three wives '' uses many of the same talents who made `` all about eve '' such a hit a year later , most notably joseph l. mankiewicz as the writer/director and celeste holm , who is present here in voice only as addie ross , the town flirt . just as three of the town 's more prominent clubwomen are about to depart on a day-long trip with underprivileged children , they receive a note from addie -- she has run off with one of their husbands . they have the whole day to think about which one it was . the jeanne crain character is insecure because she left her iowa roots and married up to one of the town gentry . the linda darnell character was `` shanty irish '' and married a department store millionaire with whom they share a rather grudging relationship . ann sothern plays a radio screenwriter who is trying to maneuver her way out of the second-best neighborhood in town into the very best . along with sharp observations about class and social climbing in small towns/suburbia , this film has sharp writing and acting and some genuinely funny moments , including a star turn from kirk douglas as a droll english teacher ( bet you thought you 'd never see him in a comedy ! ) . look for the wonderful thelma ritter as the maid from the wrong side of the tracks . all in all , `` a letter to three wives '' is a great entertainment and a welcome addition to any video collection . i have seen my copy several times and introduced it to several people .
