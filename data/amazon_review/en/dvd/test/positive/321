good job on a great story but the goliath encounter was awful excellent story and they followed most of it fairly accurately . good job with the repercussions of david 's adultery and how it affected his entire household for a long time thereafter . the dynamics of the sons were well-done with only minor omissions in the plot here and there but not enough to damage the story badly ... except in the case of goliath . with all the information about the account you 'd think they could get one detail right but i 'm not sure any aspect of it was accurate . first of all , they show goliath no larger than anyone else . also , there is no real context of a war and battle here ... goliath is just ambushing saul 's soldier 's a couple at a time . there is no forty days of taunts , david is already here , and saul is about to bravely charge off to face goliath ( never showing the least fear of goliath ) when david says to let him . he does n't even try on saul 's armor ( though saul mentions it while ridiculing david about the impossibility of david fighting ) . the only other major issue i recall was the presence of some excessive spirituality . for example , when saul is overcome by the spirit he never prophecies , he just dances rather provocatively ( a similar presentation when david dances but it is at least slightly more accurate in david 's case ) . i 'm not counting the witch of endor scene in that , since it is supposed to be spiritualistic- as per general suppositions , her spiritualistic nature is extremely freaky and witch-like with her screaming and chanting and so forth [ but try to remember all witchcraft is not so blatant ] ) . remember these are wars and adultery , etc . and they are true to the biblical account in that sense so they are not meant for family viewing
