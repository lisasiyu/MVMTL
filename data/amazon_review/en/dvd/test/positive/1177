addicted to this movie i 'm a huge clint eastwood fan , and i enjoy watching and discussing his deep , dark movies like & quot ; the beguiled & quot ; and & quot ; unforgiven. & quot ; but my guilty secret is : whenever & quot ; any which way you can & quot ; show up on cable tv , i get a big goofy grin on my face , drop everything i 'm doing , and watch it . i realize this film is an acquired taste , but i *love* it . it 's my redneck roots coming out . the overage bikers , clyde the orangutang , william smith , crazy old ruth gordon , geoffrey lewis , clint crooning with ray charles on the soundtrack , even sondra locke 's singing and acting ( which comes off as enjoyably campy in this context ) -- it 's all great ! and i love the message of & quot ; we rustic rural types are just as interesting as anybody else & quot ; ( because these *are* my people , as i 've said . ) i do n't think eastwood has made a more enjoyable movie
