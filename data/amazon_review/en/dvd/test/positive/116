the book is better . the movie is still good . pretty hard to take a well written book by the likes of john grisham and bring it all onto the screen . they do a pretty good job . matt damon plays rudy , a student in law school who 's smart , broke , and about to make history . in the meantime his partner and him are working hard on a case against a scamming life insurance company that never paid out to a boy who had cancer . the policy covered it but they would just not pay . meantime damons character is in deeper than ever , as he falls for an abused woman whose redneck husband will soon find out . read the novel , then watch the movie . it 's really a very moving story and the characters in the book and movie are alive and thriving . danny devito plays damons partner in the film and it 's one of the better roles i 've seen him play .
