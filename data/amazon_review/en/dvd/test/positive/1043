splendid ! it seems , as time goes on , henley just gets better . with the eagles he came up with 'the last resort ' possibly one of the prettiest use of chord sequences about and powerful words to accompany them . then solo with classics 'the end of the innocence ' and 'new york minute ' and now with what i regard the best two tracks on this album 'goodbye to a river ' and 'damn it rose ' . the latter trying to convey the suicide of a close friend . what you hear is what you get with henley . he has to be the finest vocalist 'live ' i 've encountered . as for his songwriting let me put it this way , i 'd put him up next to roger waters with the way his songs always manage to move me . shame they left the two best songs form the album off the dvd . splendid work mr henley . time to take another eleven year break it was worth the wait
