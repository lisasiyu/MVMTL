`` i know that you can not live on hope alone . '' harvey milk was the elected supervisor of district 6 in san francisco when he was murdered -- along with mayor george moscone on november 27 , 1978 , by fellow supervisor , dan white ( who later claimed the infamous `` twinkie defense '' ) . the film `` the times of harvey milk '' firmly places the murder of milk , a gay politician , into the politically significant context of the times . the crime , the verdict , and the sentence served were all shocking . this film tells the story behind the headlines . milk was a stockbroker on the east coast , when he decided to pull up roots and head for san francisco . he opened a camera shop on castro street and quickly earned the name of `` mayor of castro street '' for his enthusiastic community involvement . his interest led to several failed attempts to run for city office , but when the city 's elections ran by district -- rather than citywide -- milk became the newly elected supervisor for the sixth district . milk 's enthusiasm and talent for politics thrived in city hall . the film includes photographs , newsreel footage , and many interviews with those who crossed milk 's path in a professional or personal capacity . milk was passionate about public transportation , rent control , and the rights of seniors and gays . white , on the other hand , found san francisco 's gay day `` obscene . '' eerily , there are several photos of milk that also include his killer -- clean cut , ex-fireman and family man , supervisor dan white . the film explores the flavour of the times -- san francisco was becoming a gay mecca , and there were some people who could n't adjust to that fact . senator john briggs , who called san francisco `` the moral garbage dump of the nation '' was fighting to get a proposition put on the ballot that would allow gay teachers to be fired . milk fought this ballot tooth and nail , and it failed . the film `` the times of harvey milk '' includes two discs . one disc contains the film , and the other disc is packed with extra features -- including coverage of the film 's premiere in castro street , a dan white update , 1st and 25th anniversary events of the crime , director 's commentary , the academy awards 1985 , and a photo gallery . for those of us who remember the headlines , `` the times of harvey milk '' is a fascinating documentary that places the crime firmly in the context of its time -- displacedhuma
