i really loved it this was the first time that i 've seen a korean tv series . i must say that it was an enjoyable experience . even though i did n't even see the show from the beginning i saw enough to want to own the series so that i may enjoy from beginning to end over and over . i love tv shows like this with a beginng middle and end . whether english or korean this is the type of television that families could enjoy together
