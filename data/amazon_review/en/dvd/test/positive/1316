learn ( and retain ! ) the letters as a toddler my daughter ( now 2-1/2 ) started watching this dvd at 19 months . within three weeks she not only knew all her upper- and lowercase letters , but she was also obsessed with letters . we have the foam `` puzzle piece '' letters that go on the floor - she would pick out her favorite and take it to bed at night or have to carry it to the store . she watched the video obsessively for a few months until she 'd had enough , and now at nearly three she still knows all her letters in spite of not watching the video anymore . she was similarly enamored with the numbers ( meet the numbers ) and colors ( meet the colors ) and learned each in rapid succession . we went to the eye doctor several weeks ago , and the nurse was astounded that a two-year-old could actually ( and easily ) read the letters on the eye chart . we 've now started our 15 month old watching this video . she is a little young , but has really started talking so she 's in the right developmental timeframe . she has nowhere near the attention span and focus of our older daughter , yet she , too , is mesmerised by this video and is becoming obsessed with letters . it is truly amazing . we are giving this dvd as a baby shower gift to everyone we know who is expecting
