this was n't orson welles ' movie . so we do n't have the expense or baggage of an original welles production . he was hired to direct & act . the movie was made to make money & therefore to be done under budget . welles succeeded & did an excellent , stylish , directing job . in a bit of over-acting he also played the part of creepy dr. charles rankin , formerly franz kindler , nazi war criminal to perfection . this now an old fashioned movie but 1946 was the perfect time for it 's subject : nazis hiding in our midst , such as a small town in connecticut . this film noir drama may have been made on the cheap but it 's stars are first rate . besides welles , edward g. robinson plays title role , & comes to town under the guise of an antique dealer . he is actually a federal nazi hunter on the trail of franz kindler . loretta young is perfecting her role as the idiot wife of kindler/dr . rankin . you might remember her as david nevin 's stupid spouse in the bishp 's wife several years later . kindler is embedded as a professor at a private prep school . he seems to be popular with the boys . about half way through the movie , mr. wilson has a pretty good idea who dr. rankin really is . the climax is to be expected but is still well done , on a subject that still of interest today , facism in america
