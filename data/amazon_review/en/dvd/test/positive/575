well done ! perhaps it was too long ago for anyone to have memories that could correct innaccuracies but few movies of the first world war seem to get it right . this one captures the american experience in that war like few others have . drama and action together bring out a story of depth , courage , tolerance , and forbearance in the crucible of adversity . i watch it again and again . hard to believe it was made for tv and not a major picture . still one of the great war-stories to capture the american public .
