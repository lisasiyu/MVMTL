more relevant today than ever . when i watch this movie it 's as if the writer in 1975 had a pre-cognizance of what was going to happen in 2003 . pay particular attention to the last scene between redford and robertson . the words robertson says are more relevant today that they were then . besides meaning and relevance it 's also a great action thriller , with a little romance . faye dunaway is at her most beautiful and redford his most attractive . they both give truly amazing performances as ordinary people accidently caught up in monumental intrigues they know nothing of .
