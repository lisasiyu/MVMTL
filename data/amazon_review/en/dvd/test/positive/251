challenging and timeless if you loathe exercise videos in which the instructor is telling you `` good job - keep it up - way to go - that looks good '' when you know they ca n't see you , this is an excellent alternative . cindy is clear in her instructions , of course her body is inspirational , and she does n't insult your intelligence . the video itself is shot in some beautiful locations and the music is n't overbearing . the actual exercise sequences are challenging and continue to be so - even if you use this tape several times a week for a few months like i did . the best thing about this video is the results - i used this video several years ago and got down to a healthy size 4/6 . i just ordered the dvd version to get me back into shape after having my first baby and ca n't wait to start this routine again !
