titanic owes some of its success to this i love disaster movies , or any disaster movie that involves water - titanic , hard rain , titanic , pearl harbour , titanic ... yeah i love titanic . but i was shocked when watching this film how much titanic resembles it ! there 's a lot where you can see where james cameron might have got some of his ideas from . i felt very claustrophobic watching this film , not only were we watching it in the darkness , but there were also fireworks going off outside , and the film itself is very claustrophobic . there 's no natural light , as the boat is capsized . i had an awful time recognising actors in this , particularly gene hackman . i knew the name , i could not pick out which one he was . ( very blonde moment there . ) i eventually recognised him , cos he was the main character ( big clue there ) , and he was also using simon cowell 's fashion sense - high waisted trousers , and polo neck tucked in . i do n't know why it took me so long to recognise him , but i managed to recognise ernest borgnine , who played rogo , as being in little house in the prairie , in one or two episodes . the poseidon adventure is a really good film , with no need for special effects or cgi , apart from the odd one or two . nearly all the stunts were performed by the actors themselves , when possible , and they would have ended up with many bumps . what made this film all the more better was the lack of special effects , and it made it all the more real . i was holding my breath during many scenes - which was quite difficult considering i was blocked up with the cold at the time - and because it was so claustrophobic , it made it all the more worse . the poseidon adventure is definitely up there as one of my favourite disaster movies now , and i really look forward to seeing the sequel , and the 'remake ' . and i just discovered by looking at imdb , that red buttons ( what a strange name ) was also in little house on the prairie , in two episodes
