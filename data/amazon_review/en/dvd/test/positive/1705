my first exposure to tolkein : enjoyable but not addictive yet i for some reason was resistant to reading `` the hobbit '' when a teen-ager . i was not resistant to seeing these movies ; i just did n't take the time . to be honest , i found it hard to get into the movie . an hour into it , i could have given up on it . after seeing the first movie ( i was a little disappointed to feel like i only saw an incomplete story ) , i am interested in seeing the sequel , but not so interested that i 'm rushing to get it or where i 'll feel i missed out if i never find out how the story ends ( which i 'm sure will be good being victorious over evil ) . i 've just explained why i only gave this movie four stars . now , let me tell you why it earned that many ( in case you could n't tell from the other 3000+ reviews ) . the special effects were great . but so was the acting . very effective was ian holm , ian mckellan , john rhys-davies ( remember him from raiders of the lost ark ? ) , liv tyler , viggo mortenson , and christopher lee . another thing i enjoyed about it is some philosophical insights , introduced by gandalf the grey , especially the advice he gave to froddo on his decision to move forward
