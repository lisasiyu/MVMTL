fantastic animated rendition it 's hard to believe , but i never heard of wind in the willows until i was about 16 years old , when it was first read aloud to me , around a glowing campfire . it was an instant love affair . years later , i shared the classic with my children . so when we found an animated version of the book for sale in a neighbor 's tag sale , we snapped it up . we 've loved the film ever since . the animal characters -- badger , mole , toad , weasel and all the others -- congregate often at toad hall and elsewhere , and the story takes many delightful turns . this animated version , directed by dave unwin , is every bit as classic as the book . your children will surely love it as much as we did -- including the child in this particular mom . -- alyssa a. lappe
