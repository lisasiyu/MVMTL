wow ! what a fun movie ! a fun movie all around ! winona ryder and ethan hawke are definately the standout stars ! eventhough it 's basically a romance movie it still rocks the house ! i looooove the gen x 90 's feeling it has to it . it really took me back . lalaine 's desire to hustle money was a great learning lesson , too . i also think that she picked the best one in the end . but , the best thing about reality bites is it 's great filming location . h-town ! makes me sooooo proud to be from here
