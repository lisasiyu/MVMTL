the bar song enough has been said about this movie already , i think , considering its overall flimsiness . it really is `` ironic '' fun , as someone mentioned , and only for those who are tolerant enough to handle a bit of fluff and not have a coronary about it . i thought it was pretty amusing . it helps if you 're into sailing and sunny ports . be that as it may , i am surprised that no one has commented on the `` theme '' song . it features quite prominently in the beginning , introducing us to the two english lasses whiling away their evenings singing badly in a sleazy gibraltar sailor dive ; and towards the end of the film , it introduces the final twist ... with a vengeance . as it turned out to my delight , `` you 're leaving me '' -- the title of aforementioned ditty -- was an almost direct translation of a song called `` porque te vas '' by jose luis perales , one of my favorite spanish singer-songwriters . great song , really ! silly performance , though . i 'm almost a bit curious what jlp got out of it..
