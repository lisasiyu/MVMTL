season 2 having recently gotten into `` the sopranos , '' after i finished watching the first season ; i rushed to get this . let me just say , i loved the first season ; but i love this more . this is a great season of a great show . not only are the jokes funnier , the acting stronger , the plot twists more surprising , but they also made a couple good decisions . first off , livia soprano ( tony 's mom ) was a big part of the first season ( and frankly , she wore out her welcome several times ) . here , her character is decreased and when she does appear ... it 's not bad . anyway ... tony soprano ( james gandolfini ) and his family , including wife carmela ( edie falco ) , daughter meadow ( jamie-lynn sigler ) , and son a.j . return with a whole array of family and business issues . tony is still seeing dr. melfi ( lorraine bracco ) , his shrink . christopher ( michael imperioli ) tries acting . adreanna 's ( drea de matteo ) uncle richie shows up in the beginning of the season , becoming a main character and ends up dating tony 's sister janice ; despite a personal-and-business feud between them . oh , and there 's a rat in the family . i do n't want to say too much , because i think with any show , it 's better to watch each episode without any real knowledge of what 's going to happen . but , rest assured , if you like the 1st season . you 'll definitely like this one . here 's the list of episodes and a few comments : 1 . guy walks into a psychiatrist 's office-the first episode of the 2nd season picks up basically where the first one left off . tony 's uncle junior is in jail , which makes tony new boss , he 's severed ties with his mother , and his psychiatrist wo n't see him . in this episode his sister janice shows up . 2 . do not resuscitate-nothing really significant occurs in this episode , but it is pretty entertaining . it 's not the best , but it 's not the worst . 3 . toodle f**king oo-this episode is pretty funny , except my interest in tony 's mother in the hospital goes down everytime there 's a scene that takes place there . 4 . commendator-in this episode , tony goes to italy without carmela or the kids for business purposes and pussy 's wife wants to divorce him . the episode is written by series creator , david chase ... so , it 's one of the better episodes even though it 's different from the other ones . 5 . big girls do n't cry-this is the most entertaining and cool episode so far and features christopher joining an acting class and letting out some of his inner demons as well as tony returning to therapy . 6 . the happy wanderer-this episode has an array of cool things . guest appearances by frank sinatra jr. and robert patrick ; and you hear the song `` down '' by stone temple pilots played in the background in one scene . the season is getting a lot better later on , because this is a really great episode . 7 . d girl-this episode is extremely close to perfect . guest appearances by jon favreau , janeane garofalo , and sandra bernhard . 8 . full leather jacket-a surprising ( and funny ... kinda ) ending makes this episode one of the best this season . 9 . from where to eternity-this episode is written by michael imperioli , who plays christopher , and deals with what happened in the previous episode . very dramatic , very funny , and very entertaining . the classic r & b score works really well . 10 . bust out-in this episode , carmela comes close to having an affair with a painter . it 's an entertaining episode . 11 . house arrest-this episode is very funny and you also get to see a sensitive side to uncle junior . 12 . the knight in white satin armor-this episode was n't my favorite , but the last 20 minutes were great . one of the main characters may or may not die in this episode . 13 . funhouse-when an episode of a show is written by it 's creator ( especially when it 's the season finale ) it 's usually really good . this is one of the strongest episodes . grade : a
