satire on the revival business this film shows a 1920 speakeasy . elmer gantry is feeling no pain , and walks around to collect money on christmas eve for the salvation army . his sleaziness and dishonesty are quite apparent . after hopping a freight train , he jumps off to avoid being robbed . he seems to live without working , just going from town to town . [ a crooked gambler or a confidence man ? ] next he shows up at a revival meeting , where a young woman preaches and passes buckets for donations . [ is this entertainment before radio and movies ? ] elmer 's attempt to meet sister sharon falconer is rebuffed ; she knows the type . can a salesman switch to a new line of products ? [ many say it 's the personality not the product . ] elmer 's speech is quite popular with the audience . but what makes him give up smoking and drinking ? or inspire his speeches ? there is another scene where a member of the audience begins to bark ! revivals grew out of the rural frontier , where people gathered like at a social event . a revival in zenith can bring in church members , converts , donations , and publicity . but the revival company needs a guarantee to cover their fixed costs . [ no one thinks of cutting costs . ] george babbitt explains why they must fill the churches - so people wo n't be tempted by other diversions ( like politics ) . sister sharon 's speech moves the crowd . it 's a successful social event . the film shows how the press can turn public opinion against the revival meeting . [ no mention of their hidden agenda . ] there is an interesting philosophical conversation in the editor 's office . elmer shows his dialectical skills ; he learned rhetoric at his seminary school . god 's will brought sister sharon to zenith , she will be able to build her tabernacle . there is a large amount of populism in his speech ; he attacked powerful corporations . [ rural farmers were hit by the depression in 1921 . ] elmer 's call for popular revolt seems quite radical . he leads an attack on a speakeasy , then a brothel . local gambling dens are overlooked . elmer 's past catches up with him : a blonde in a hotel room . this is a trap to photograph him in the act , a trick often used against reformers . they ask for a huge amount in blackmail , and for sharon to deliver the cash . the publication of the photos are a front page scandal . attendance drops off . some rowdies show up to create a disturbance . [ did shutting down local vice hurt the wallets of the local ruling class ? ] a man who went deaf suddenly appears . after sister sharon lays her hands on him and calls for his healing . it works ! [ no ringer here . ] but a discarded cigarette causes a fire and a panic . is this the work of a devil ? no fire regulations ? sister sharon leaves for a better world . [ i do n't know if this film is true to the book . it is a good story , but the ending seems weak . ] why did people in rural areas turn to revivalism ? 1921 saw the beginning of the great depression for them . other organizations like the populists or the socialists were suppressed , their leaders jailed . religion was the only way they could assemble together without being stopped . that is why the corporations were against them .
