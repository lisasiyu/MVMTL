excellent learning tool for introducing your child to the alphabet i love this video because my 3.5 year old learned his letters ( both upper and lower-case ) in a week . sadly , he did not have much exposure to the alphabet prior to this video so we were extremely happy with how quickly he learned . i thought he would get bored with it because it 's very repetitious ( eg . the letter 'a ' is repeated several times with the image flashing in different positions ) but they do use that same letter 'a ' as a cute character ( a rocket that takes off into the sky while saying 'a ' ) which my child loves . each letter ( both upper and lower-case ) has a different character ( although the upper and lower-case of each letter is similar - for example , letter 'a ' and 'a ' are both rockets in different environments ) . the kids voices used for the characters are also endearing to hear over-and-over ... which we do watch over-and-over-and-over at my oldest son 's request . ( my 18 mo old son loves this video also !
