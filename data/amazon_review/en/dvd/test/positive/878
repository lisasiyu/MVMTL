one of the funniest dvd 's ever i have to admit being a new yorker i have never have had to live with knowing my team would never win the big one and instead would always lose in the most crushing ways possible . but this dvd had me cracking up the whole way through . its amazing to watch these fans live for a team that can not ever get over the hump . but towards the end i started feeling really bad for all these people . cause you could see the anguish in their eyes , and in their faces . this team really means a lot to them . the fact that it is the brass ring ( in this case winning a world series ) none of them will ever be able to grab left me feeling bad for them . having said that i still laughed about as hard as i ever have at a dvd . my dad , and i have watched it several times and we still laugh like crazy
