what a treat when our adult children were small they loved this film . now we have an eight year old who is extremely physically handicapped but is mentally alert . he absolutely loves this film . when i hold it up to see if he wants to watch it and he gets the biggest smile . it is a film that children never get tired of and we adults love it too . i had actually forgotten about this movie until i ran across it one day and i immediately ordered it . i am so glad it finally came out on dvd .
