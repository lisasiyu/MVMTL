hybrid of sixth sense and psyco i am really tired of watching `` sixth sense genre '' movies where dead people hang out with alive through out the movie and at the end give obvious creepyness . this movie also has a dead sister hanging out with the other alive one and at the end gives the chilling creepyness . but the originality of this movie is there is no ghosts ; the dead sister is only a creepy imagination of psyco sister that is still alive . actually i enjoyed more watching two sisters taking care of eachother . they are adorable together . i think i am gon na keep this movie .
