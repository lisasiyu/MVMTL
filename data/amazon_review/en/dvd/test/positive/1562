pantswettingly funny i gave `` the aristocrats '' 1 star , as i thought it was just a pile of disgusting comments , words and images going nowhere . this pamela roast is a heap of disgusting comments , words and images definately going somewhere - to your funnybone - because it is applied with wit ! i do n't want to spoil your fun by quoting jokes from the show , but let me just give you an example . referring to the sextape of pamela and tommy , one of the roasters said : '' i have not seen a p***y take such a pounding since clay aitken lost to ruben stuttard '' . i thought this was a hilarious roast , and i regularly show it to friends who then fall about laughing . i also thought pamela handled it with grace and style , and i admire her immensely for that ! if you like adult comedy , you can not go wrong with this dvd
