gave me a new perspective on things as they are this was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all . it was a very sad day when the election was stolen from mr. gore , but this movie gave me a new realization . that being in office would have held this man back . his talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious . this is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do . mr. gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes . he gives a website climatecrisis.net for more ideas and info . if you think this might be too boring for your taste , give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish . thank you mr. gore and all of the people who helped you make this happen
