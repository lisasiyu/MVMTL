salute the king of new york with this concert , he proved he was the king of new york . for a rapper to sell out madison square garden by himself , as quick as he did , was no real surprise when we all know jay-z 's achievements over the years . this concert was the culmination of an incredible career . 'the black album ' delivered what jay-z promised , he was back to his very best , and his incredible performance on this dvd showcases that . the live performance is very well mixed in with studio shots of jay-z at work with producers working on songs . it gives the viewer and understanding of what has to happen for a song to be completed , and it also showed jay 's unique way of delivering his rhymes , without any paper , just remembering them and spitting them on the fly . the concert was unbelievable . jay-z trotted out star after star to help him with all his collabo 's over the years . the only time this let him down was when he had beanie sigel , memphis bleek and freeway on stage at the same time . all 3 rappers detracted from jay-z being the main show , but this is how i felt on 'the dynasty ' so i guess it was n't going to change . the night finished with jay-z performing encore and december 4th so a crowd delerious with joy and satisfaction . after this performance , jay-z will go down in rap history as one of the best to ever grace the microphone . definitely buy this , it 's well worth it .
