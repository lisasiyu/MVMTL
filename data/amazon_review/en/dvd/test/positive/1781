it 's not `` just '' giant robot anime ( part two ) ... here 's the deal if you have not seen the series do n't watch this movie . it would take far to many words to explain the series it is something that has to be watched to get . my only notes are that it 's not that hard to follow as long as you are good at paying attention to details ( and of course you have seen the series and did honestly pay attention to it ) . other reviewers i 'm sure have summed up what it 's about . the movie is basically the action packed , mine-trip , fight scene , blood-n-gore of the end that many said was lacking in the last twp episodes of the series ( i.e . what`s happening `` out side '' of the characters minds in reality ) . this movie is just as deep and sometimes down right confusing as the series , and that`s why i like it . for me mixing parts of this movie with the series episodes 25 and 26 was vary satisfying . many say watching the movie between episodes 24 and 25 seems right . but really it would take a huge edit job to get it right . all the parts are there you just need to rearrange them the to make them right in my opinion
