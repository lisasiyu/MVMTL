uncut escaflowne is better than the fox version the uncut escaflowne still is n't quite as good as the original with subtitles , but it much better than fox 's version . thing make more sense now because fox was cutting out important scenes . this series is a must have and this tape is definitely good and with every tape i get the series seems to get better and better
