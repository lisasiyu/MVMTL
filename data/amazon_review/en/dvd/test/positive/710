great tidbits i did n't love everything about this film . in fact , the first time i saw it , i felt it was lacking in depth . but the second time i watched it , many little moments shone through and i saw the depth of emotion being prtrayed . first , payton 's performance as andrew really hit a few times . when he first starts warming up to christian ( as christian grows more confident ) by responding to christian 's teasing , i thought this was some complex and genuine emotions . there 's a great `` you bitch , okay , let me see that '' moment . second , i liked aaron 's genuineness when bisset 's character is suffering and he knows he does n't have anything to make her feel good . i also like the fact that he put bisset 's character 's needs ahead of his own agenda of converting people . finally , i thought the best moment was between aaron and his mom ( mary kay place ) as place 's character begins to comprehend the suffering of her son and begins to get past her prejudices . after my second viewing , i fell in love with the film . worth owning .
