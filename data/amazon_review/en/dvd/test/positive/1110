a good piece of work do n't get it wrong this movie is not about the million man march . this is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst african-american men . this movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs , and how this affects unity amongst african-american men and women . i like how spike lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers . the documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work
