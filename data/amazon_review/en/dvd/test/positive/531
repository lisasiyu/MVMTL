not another teeny bopper movie this movie surprised me . i expected something like she 's all that , one of the better teen movies ( to me ) ... or maybe something less than that . but this movie was not what i expected . it was fresh and funny ! it made references to john cougar mellancamp and the storyline was unusual , absurb , and it worked . good comedy . not on my top ten list , but worth a viewing , in my book
