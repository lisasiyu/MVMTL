my favorite of the bunch many fans of the orignal chainsaw massacre would have me hanged for saying this , but the beginning is my favorite of the entire lot . it 's a great prequel ! the movie is completely brutal and disgusting and even funny in some twisted ways . leatherface looks totally awesome and the family is even crazier than ever . if you liked the tcm remake a few years ago , you 'll love this new one .
