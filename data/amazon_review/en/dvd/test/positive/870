`` out of my way , dildo ... ! '' despite the fact that it was slapped with an x rating , flesh gordon is really a spoof of the old movie serials of the 30s and 40s ... most notably flash gordon . in fact if you saw the old flash gordon serials you 'll really find the film funny ... the humor is basically kentucky fried movie and groove tube type camp ... funny almost `` rocky horror-esque '' lines , and over the top scenarios . - - the film is most interesting because the low budget special effects are pretty good ( the fx team seems to take up half the credits and one of them went on to direct the the hells have eyes ) , yet at the same time it is definitely a nudie of that era ... ( the flip side is that it has enough plot , content and dialogue that you could edit it all out and it would still be funny . ) in the end , i 'm really surprized that this campy cult classic is n't one of the all time movie nerd favorites ... it is genuinely funny and tasteless from the get go to the big finale ! *as a funny side note aside from a really cool and groovy tune featuring some jazzy fender rhodes , there 's an ... organ scene featuring some really nifty and gospelly hammond organ ... the guy is *really* playing the pedals and playing the chords like you rarely get to hear these days
