played more for laughs unlike sorcerer hunters where the humor plays around the edges of the plot , this one seems like the gags were dreamed up first . my almost 12-yr-old wanted this one for months before i bought it . there 's a lot of familiar voice actors ( adv studio-andrew klimko/sorcerer hunters-gateau ) & kelly manison/s.h.-big mama , martian successor nadesico-haruka , excel-great will of the macroverse . japanese actors tomokazu seki/m.s.nadesico-gai daigoji , card captor sakura-toya , x-kamui & kotono mitsushi/sailor moon-usagi , excel saga-excel , blue seed-kome . they even got dbz 's bulma-hiromi tsuru on ep 12 ) so the whole thing comes off pretty well . i found the plot a bit thin -- or maybe just a poor excuse to strip characters ' clothes off almost every ep , but i did laugh quite a bit
