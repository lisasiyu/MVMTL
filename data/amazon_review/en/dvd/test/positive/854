warriors of the vatican this is based on the book vampire $ by john steakley . james woods is a cynical vampire hunter and leads a team sanctioned by the vatican . but after a job in the southwest things go wrong . suddenly a vampire shows up who is immensely powerful and knows woods by name . in just moments the vampire slaughters everyone present , slayers , cops , prostitutes . only those who were not there survived . to make matters worse , the monsignor in charge of the slayers has arrived from the vatican and wishes to meet with woods . woods is introduced to a new priest for the team and told to assemble and train a new team . but woods is ticked off and wants to know how a vampire can be so powerful and also knows his name . woods does not follow his orders . instead he tries to track down the vampire . it seems this is the original vampire ; the one who spawned the rest . the vampire was created during a botched exorcism and seeks to perform a new ritual that will make him even more powerful and eliminate some of his weaknesses . woods has little time to find the vampire and put a stop to him . woods also has to put up with team members who are in grave danger of turning into vampires themselves . armed with guts , a hatred of vampires , and some modern weaponry woods is all that stands between the world and total domination by vampire . this is a james woods movie pure and simple . sure , it has vampires , action , and women , but it is woods that makes the movie . his character is wonderful . you have to wonder at how desperate the vatican is for slayers to even tolerate woods let alone employ him . the slaying techniques are different , efficient , and very sensible . all in all a pretty fun movie with james woods at his absolute best . fans of joss whedon 's firefly will probably get a kick out of the score which seems to have inspired the music in firefly . check it out
