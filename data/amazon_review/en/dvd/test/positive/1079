i 'm so excited i literally feel like i 'm going to fall over and die . my anticipation is so great that i can hardly contain myself . i 'm counting down the days , no , the minutes till it arrives at my doorstep . when it does , i fear that i just may very well keel over with a heart attack and die i wo n't be able to stand it . i can only hope my poor heart will hold out long enough for me to actually watch the movies . i will be so happy then .
