`` is this a kissing story ? '' i 'm a big fan of fantasy films from the 1980s , and after reviewing a couple here on amazon , this particular dvd came up . `` looks a bit girly , '' i thought , and so did my brother when he came over and spotted it on the coffee table . but for the most part `` the princess bride '' , is actually fun for both boys and girls , and for viewers of all ages . a boy ( fred savage from `` the wonder years '' ) is sick in bed , so his granpa ( peter falk ) comes to visit him . he 's brought a book for them to read together called `` the princess bride '' , a book that 's been in the family for generations , and has always cheered the family up when they 're sick . the boy is put off by the name , but decides to humour his grandpa and lets him read . his grandpa tells a tale of a peasant girl , buttercup , ( robin wright ) who falls deeply in love with a farm boy named westley ( cary elwes ) , only to be heartbroken when he goes on a trip , apparently killed by pirates on the way . buttercup vows never to love again , but these words do n't stop the prince of florin from taking her hand in marriage . before the wedding , buttercup is kidnapped by a sicilian , then counter-kidnapped by a fear some `` dread-pirate '' . but things are not as they appear , love that was thought to be dead is actually alive , and many an adventure and story are had , in this land full of monstrous eels , giant rats , fire-swamps , giants , six-fingered swordsmen and horrible instruments of torture . though there is a little bit of romance and melodrama in the film , it is a fairly light hearted piece . everyone seems to be having a lot of fun . the score , which is mostly gm-like keyboard tones , by mark knopfler adds to the goofiness of things , though it is a tender track when it needs to be . the sets and costumes are pretty nice too , as is the character development . there 's a couple of cameo appearances in the film as well , ( like billy crystal as a `` miracle worker '' ) so keep an eye out . worth a look for fans of fantasy and of romantic comedy . do n't be put off by the title , it 's a lot more than ( as fred savage 's character puts it ) a `` kissing story ''
