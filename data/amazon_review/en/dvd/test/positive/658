good but flawed spielberg `` munich '' is not one of steven spielberg 's best films , but it is still worth watching due mainly to a brilliant cast.eric bana , geoffrey rush , and daniel craig are especially outstanding.the film also has an impressive physical production and a haunting john williams score . but there are problems.for one thing , it 's too long.that seems to be a problem many directors have today.why do all of today 's big movies have to run nearly three hours ? spielberg could have cut half an hour , and the film would have been much better.but the biggest problem is that spielberg , kushner , and roth have really stacked the deck for israel here . the story is entirely one-sided.there is an excellent scene where the arab and israeli agents confront each other , and the three filmmakers would have been wise to pursue that angle.instead , no explanation is given to the arabs'side or to why they seized the athletes in the first place.the result is a decidedly unbalalnced story.and the ending is ambiguous.still , `` munich '' is an ambitious film worth watching
