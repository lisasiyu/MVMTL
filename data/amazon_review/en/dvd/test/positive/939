slow flow with an iyengar twist this dvd was great if you want a slower flowing yoga dvd . i think this dvd is good for just about anybody familiar with yoga , and how to use yoga blocks . seane starts off slowly with meditation , breathing exercises , and then slowly starts going into the actual postures . the postures themselves were not difficult for advanced beginner and up practioners . however , seane goes through these postures slowly enough where you will start to feel different parts of your body open up . seane pays a fair amount of attention to alignment ( moreso than i am use to seeing in a vinyasa flow type dvd ) . she takes her time getting into and out of the postures and this where i feel anyone can benefit from this dvd . if you are the type of person looking for a vinyasa flow dvd to make you move , sweat , drop a few pounds , or want very challenging postures , then this probably is not the dvd for you . i would suggest shiva rae 's yoga shakti dvd which has something for almost every skill level , except maybe the truly gifted and advanced yogis/yoginis out there ( the arm balances she does are almost all intermediate to advanced ) . however , if you want to really focus on the alignment and feeling of some of the more basic postures , and you are looking for something slower than the average flow yoga dvd , then this is a home run
