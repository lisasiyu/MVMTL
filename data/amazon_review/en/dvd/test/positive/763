all right , good one then ... akira kurosawa 's masterpiece gets the 'do-over ' from criterion . this is by all accounts the definitive dvd version of this landmark film , absolutely no question about it . i have had this disc since the day it was released and i have yet to look at all of the extras , let alone watch the movie all the way through . i 'm one of those frame-by-frame , shot-by-shot viewers . i have seen the film several times over the years , mostly on criterion 's original release of the film , this is going way back . if you have never seen this film do n't waste your time with any other version than this one . it does not disappoint . kydu
