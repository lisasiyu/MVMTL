very well done neo-noir brian depalma 's blow out is a taut thriller that would make hitchcock proud . the master of suspense loved to put his characters in situations where they had to sit by helplessly while events occur beyond their control - the best example of this is rear window - and depalma uses that technique to great effect in the finale of blow out . john travolta plays jack , a philadelphia movie sound man who witnesses a car accident one night while he is out recording audio on a bridge . he manages to rescue sally ( nancy allen ) from the wreckage , but another man - who we later find out is the front-running presidential candidate mcryan - is left for dead . after reviewing his recording of the accident , jack determines that this was no accident . he believes that somebody deliberately shot out the tire , but who , and why ? when video of the accident surfaces , shot by a man named karp ( dennis franz ) , jack begins to suspect that both sally and karp know more than they 're letting on . we also see glimpses of a vigilante psychopath , played by john lithgow , but who is he , and what are his motives ? jack is determined to find out the truth and unravel the conspiracy , but despite many clues that this was n't an accident , nobody else seems to want to investigate any further . jack is also scared that now that the assassins have achieved their goal , anyone who might discover that this was no accident must be eliminated , including himself and sally , to whom he has developed an attachment . blow out is an excellent film that entertains on many levels - plus it takes place in my fair city of philadelphia . it does n't dumb anything down for the audience , and the characters manage to act like any of us could see ourselves acting if placed in the same situations . thumbs up .
