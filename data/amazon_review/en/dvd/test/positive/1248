barbarella 's influence on pop-culture ... ! ok , we all know that duran duran got their name from the evil doctor in barbarella , but barbarella 's influence on pop-culture extends far beyond that ! fans of x-men will notice that when the great tyrant captures pygar , it 's identical ( practically frame by frame ) to the introduction of callisto and the morlocks in # 169 ( x-men fans , pull out your issues , you 'll see what i 'm talking about ) . demolition man ( sorry , i love campy movies ) , uses many of the elements of the `` perfect society '' that barbarella comes from - down to the way they have sex ( sitting next to each other with your hands up ) . there are many others , but i 'll let you discover them for yourselves
