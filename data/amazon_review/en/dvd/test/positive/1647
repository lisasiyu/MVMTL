excellent series , horrible dvd i thuroughly enjoyed this series when it aired way back when , and it has , if anything , improved over the years . outstanding acting and performances , as well as superb writing that the hollywood ca n't seem to craft . i have nothing but praise for this series . the dvd authors , however , have much to answer for . absolutely no effort has been made to clean up the video during transfer . some of the footage is absolutely dirty ( and that from someone who usually does n't notice audio or video glitches ) . what imbecile put a 5-minute advertisement for the company 's other dvd offerings and disables the `` skip '' and `` menu '' functions . the only way to get past these advertisements is to play them at whatever fast-forward speed your dvd player has . special features are not worth mentioning , and subtitles are non-existant
