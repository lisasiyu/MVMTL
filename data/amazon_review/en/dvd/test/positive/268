it 's quite surprising how much it holds up before south park came on the air and offended practically everybody with cripple fights to cooking parents in chili to saying the s word a record 162 times , there was beavis and butthead . found on mtv , the pair were crude and just plain moronic who laughed at even the mention of dirty words bringing out the popular catchphrase `` uh-huh , you said `` . after the show ended , the pair got their own movie and became a surprise hit so who would 've guessed that it 's actually still funny ? beavis and butthead are sleeping on their trademark couch which allows a pair of robbers to steal their prized tv . not wanting to just allow it , they go hunting for it and end up meeting muddy , a biker who will pay them to `` do '' his wife , which of course he means kill but they did n't get that part . so he flies them to vegas to meet her only she sends them to washington with something particularly interesting and quite dangerous . and of course the hilarity and antics ensue . now , the humor seems kind of tame . buzzards having sex with each other or a topless sphinx probably does n't have that kneeslapper kick to it like it used to . not that i mind anyway since even if certain jokes do n't work , the whole thing has a very loose and laid-back feeling about it where it does n't even matter if you 're not laughing , you 're just glad they 're up there . some jokes , such as the preposition one , beavis ' alter-ego cornholio are always funny , not to mention robert stack 's atf character 's love for cavity searches . does it have some problems ? a bit . the reliance on toilet humor can only go so far and you kind of wanted them to do more america rather than the limited ones we have here . we literally skip over certain states that could 've got some good mileage . and while visually impressive , the rob zombie inspired freak-out in the desert just does n't fit ( and to be honest : anything involving rob zombie and filmmaking just does n't work ) . but they 're only minor concerns and of course this is a mtv movie - a beavis and butthead one nonetheless - so all that stuff gets thrown out the window . the special features are pretty good but you kind of wish there was more . we have a commentary with mike judge and yvette kaplan with mike slipping into character a couple times ( not often enough but the mention of his dream involving the movie is hilarious ) . the featurette is slightly disappointing as while we do get some background and discussion , some of it is either redundant and back-patting or mentioned already in the commentary . but seeing some footage of the va 's , including mike judge doing beavis , butthead and mr. anderson are always awesome . if you were into the show , this is of course a good place to start . if you were n't , give it a try since this is probably the best launch pad to get into the show
