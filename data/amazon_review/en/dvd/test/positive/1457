excellent pilates dvd ! ! ! ! this is the best instructional pilates dvd ! i really like the fact that sarah has a section that shows you the basic moves and principles before you start the exercises . as a beginner , this allowed me to go back and make sure i was doing things correctly . it is a great work out and i know this is a dvd i will continue to use
