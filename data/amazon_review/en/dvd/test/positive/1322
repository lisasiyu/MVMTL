solid entertainment i am glad best of the best released on dvd . even though it is only the 3rd and 4th of the series . the third one is about tommy lee ( phillip rhee ) fights a group of neo-nazi . best of the best 4 , tommy is up against russian mafia who involved in counterfeit . both movies are quite good for this martial arts action genre . you got 2 movies for slightly higher price of a single dvd so it is quite a deal . the picture quality is ok ( full screen only ) and no 5.1 dolby digital , just dolby 2.0 which is not too bad either . i wish best of the best 1 & amp ; 2 will be released soon on dvd . best of the best 2 is available on dvd in canada . for those who ca n't wait you can find these put up on auctions by canadians in ebay . i have not received my copy yet so i ca n't comment on the quality of the dvd
