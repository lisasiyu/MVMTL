beautiful pilates video you will do often this pilates video stands out from the rest . the setting is a beautiful beach cove with the background audio of gentle waves , not music . after you heat up with the 100 's and rest of the warm-up you almost feel like you are on that beach next to the instructor doing the routines . other videos are often filmed in a stark unchanging studio and can get boring after a few times . the instructor has a nice smile and pleasing voice , and gives just the right amount of instruction and with the right tempo , making the exercises very easy to follow while always reminding you of your posture and breath . the routines flow easily from pose to pose without unnecessary gaps or breaks . the first part is perfect for beginners , yet i found the second part challenging enough for an early intermediate level . do n't skip the intro , where the instructor does a nice job explaining what pilates is all about and how to intergrate it in your practice . since this video in enjoyable to do , i find myself practicing with it often . i just returned from a snowboarding trip and felt improvements in my core strengh , balance and flexibility . i recommend it for beginners to early intermediates who want to enhance how they feel and how they perform in sports .
