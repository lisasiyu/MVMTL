iconographic performances in memorable comedy-drama mgm 's 1932 grand hotel , which featured an all-star cast in a series of interweaving plotlines set against a glamorous berlin hotel , was a tremendous success , and the studio wasted no time in acquiring dinner at eight , a popular broadway show by george s. kauffman and edna ferber that had much the same concept and which could be given the same all-star treatment . when new york society matron and relentless social climber millicent jordan has the opportunity to host a dinner for members of the english aristocracy , she determines to go all out -- and the film follows the lives of her soon-to-be guests over the course of a week . millicent ( billie burke ) is unaware that husband oliver ( lionel barrymore ) faces both a business and medical crisis . oliver 's friend carlotta ( marie dressler ) , a stage star of yesteryear , has sold her stock in oliver 's company -- which allows loudmouth business tycoon dan packard ( wallace beery ) the chance to cash in at oliver 's expense . by coincidence , packard 's wife kitty ( jean harlow ) is having an affair with oliver 's doctor , wayne talbot ( edmund lowe ) -- and if this were not complication enough , oliver and millicent 's daughter paula ( madge evans ) is on the verge of provoking a social scandal via an affair with aging and alcoholic movie star larry renault ( john barrymore . ) and all of them are invited to dine . dinner at eight is usually described as a comedy , and it is true that there are several notable comic performances . the most famous of these are wallace beery and jean harlow , who give outrageous performances as the bickering packards ; billie burke and marie dressler also score as the harried hostess and the retired actress whose charms are long gone . where comedy is concerned , dinner at eight plays extremely , extremely well and can hold its own with even the best of 1930s comedy -- but in truth the movie is more of a drama than a comedy , and where drama is concerned it shows its age in no uncertain terms . for one thing , the script relies a great deal on coincidence . this adds to the fun where comedy is concerned , but it works less well for drama , and in dinner at eight the neatness with which the parallel plots link to each other is a bit too pat . for antoher thing , there is a clash of style between the film 's comic and dramatic moments , most particularly in terms of the john barrymore sequences , where the acting seems excessively stagey . instead of seamless , the various elements tend butt against each other in a slightly awkward way . even so , and whether your taste runs to acid-tongued comedy , broad melodrama , or wild farce , dinner at eight offers a great deal to enjoy . the performances are first rate , with the comic moments a true delight ; there is dark irony in john barrymore 's performance ; and the set designs and costuming are nothing short of iconographic : it is impossible to think of jean harlow , for instance , without envisioning her against a white-on-white modern bedroom -- and that , and a great deal more , comes straight out of this film . although the film has not been remastered , the print and sound are extremely good , and bonus features include a very good documentary on jean harlow , who more or less steals the show from her numerous co-stars . recommended . gft , amazon reviewe
