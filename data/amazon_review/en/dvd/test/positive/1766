santa 's here stay far away from the sequel , but watch this one . it was definitely worth the money spent on this . people offended by this movie had no lives or no other current events to spew hateful remarks at . why , or who , would not want to see santa kill off people ? this is a society who watches leprachauns , snow men , scarecrows and god knows what else kill people for entertainment . but this movie puts all the others to shame and stands out to me as a truly unique and enjoyable experience .
