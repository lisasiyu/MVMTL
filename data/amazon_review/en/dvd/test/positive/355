this version is much better i purchased the first version eagerly when it was released . since then i 've purchased the rest of the seasons and was relieved when they started making the slim more compact packaging . i also noticed there were some flaws in the first set of dvd 's like no intro music and some other glitches that did n't match the others . the first version has 9 full size dvd boxes and only 4 episodes per dvd . it 's like they had to work out the kinks . it took me a long time to decide to purchase the `` new '' first season because i already paid $ 95.00 for it the first time , but i am glad i did . they added in a colorized intro section with ricky singing `` i love lucy '' that i just love . not to mention it 's smaller and matches my collection . if your 're trying to decide which first season to buy , this is the one . it has the same great first season eposides and extras , smaller , more episodes per dvd and the price is so right !
