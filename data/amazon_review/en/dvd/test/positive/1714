mel gibson 's lost kick-butt movie found the best action movie i 've seen this year is n't in theaters . you may think you 've seen it , but probably have n't . `` payback '' is back , this time the way the director envisioned the film , not the suits . `` you do n't make pictures for the elite , '' producer/star mel gibson says today , explaining why paramount and warner bros. took the noirish gangland movie away from freshman director brian helgeland . after 10 days of reshoots , a new final ( third ) act was tacked on , voiceover was added a la `` blade runner '' and kris kristofferson walked on as a new major character . audiences still were amazed how brutal the gibson character was when they had to `` get ready to root for the bad guy , '' as the marketing had it . same old story about artists and hollywood , but this time came a happier ending . in 2005 , paramount and gibson gave helgeland another shot at the film , eight years after its release . the tapes turned up missing , so helgeland and his editor recut the film using film . and so we have `` payback : straight up -- the director 's cut . '' now , this is one hard-boiled movie . gibson plays a criminal who comes back to town looking for the partner who stole half his loot , and his wife , following a heist . along the way he single-handedly takes on both the syndicate and asian drug dealers , slugs a woman ( a scene the studios cut ) , and stirs up a john woo-like shootout as the bloody finale . supporting actors lucy liu , gregg henry and maria bello all do fine work . there are multiple dvd extras , including a director 's commentary , but the one to catch is the half-hour `` same story -- different movie , '' all about the film 's resurrection . audio and video are sharp on the dvd -- and better on high definition discs , although in places the colors seem a bit too jacked up for a gritty , bleach-bypass film . `` payback '' comes from the same book as `` point blank '' with lee marvin , an even better film from 1969
