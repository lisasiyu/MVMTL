better of many older submarine thrillers i was really impressed by this film and i must congratulate hollywood for presenting the soviet war machine in such a realistic way . the direction was fine , the actors well chosen , the script very good and harrison ford 's acting top quality . i think this film was superior to older ones like `` the hunt for red october '' or `` crimson tide '' whose story was rather flat and predictable . the key advantage of the film is the intense psychological charging of the crew 's attempts to cool the damaged reactor and the marvellous portrait of traditional russian self-sacrifice
