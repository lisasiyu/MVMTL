excellent makeover for a masterpiece many of the other reviews have summarized akira kurosawa 's excellent film , so i wo n't recap it since you are probably familiar with the seven samurai . rather , if you are concerned about shelling out the money for this edition when you already have the earlier release , rest easy . it is well worth the price . having seen the movie many , many times , i was shocked at how the upgraded footage made scenes seen new and brought out many details i had missed . the supplemental materials ( commentaries , documentaries , interviews , and the booklet ( with reminiscences from mifune toshiro ) complement the movie nicely . if you are on the fence , go ahead and buy it . this dvd is worth it
