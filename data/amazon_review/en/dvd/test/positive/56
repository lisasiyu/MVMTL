a simple plot with some great slapstick action and pure comedy i first saw help ! when i was in middle school , rifling through my parents ' vhs collection . my friends and i were won over by this silly comedy and the fab four , and i have treasured the movie ever since . it is unfortunate that the us dvd release is out of print ( i had to buy an imported version ) , and i hope they bring it back soon , so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy . the plot is pure genius in its simplicity : a gaudy red ring gets stuck on ringo 's finger . a sacrificial cult chases him around the world , trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice . a mad scientist is determined that he could -- dare i say it ? -- rule the world , if he could only get the ring off ringo 's finger . the beatles are absolutely clueless . so they run around the world , dodging crazy people at every turn , singing songs , and generally being hilarious . the dvd i bought had options to watch the movie dubbed in french . so once you 've seen help ! enough times to know every line by heart , try it out in a foreign language , and laugh even harder at the beatles speaking in french . go ... to ... the window ... go ... to ... the window..
