an observation of the taboo ... with depth . let 's be honest . sex is a fundamental aspect of all of our lives , yet most of us are really afraid to deal with it honestly . this movie deals with a particular aspect of sexuality in a refreshingly honest way . whether you know anything about dominance/submission or not , this film is remarkable in that it gives us all a glimpse of what that particular sexual dynamic is all about , and it does it in a way that is quite frankly , non-sensational and non-gratuitous . and you do not need to have any affinity with dominance or submission to really 'get ' and enjoy this movie , for it goes much deeper . this is a excellent character study . the film is quite erotic , although very little actual sex is shown . it 's power is in the anticipation and what is not said . it 's about need . as several other reviewers have brought out here , there 's alot going on here besides the allure of a taboo form of sex . the beauty of the film is in it 's subtlety and the depth of the characters , which the director takes time to develop . both james spader and maggie gyllenhaal are compatible complements in this story , which really is a story about 'complements ' . it 's about finding that balance in the energy between two people . there is a silent , powerful unspoken attraction between the two characters that transcends their established professional roles . the viewer can really just 'sense ' this dynamic building throughout the film . there is so much here that is communicated just with the look in the eyes . there is so much that is unspoken , yet if you pay attention , you know what is going on . i think it 's great film-making . in an age when we are innundated with quick , flash images every other second , sensational sex and violence for it 's own sake , and a total lack of character development , i find it refreshing to see a movie like this that moves slowly on purpose to develop the phyche of the characters , and secretary does that superbly . i also find it refreshing that a film be made about this rather taboo subject with an non-judgmental , open honesty . after all , in the end , its a love story . a story of fufilled and satified needs on both ends of the equation . and really , is n't that what any successful relationship is really about ? the look in lee 's face in the last frame of the movie says it all .
