john lecarre , bbc at their best `` tinker tailor soldier spy , '' the 1979 british broadcasting company 's 6-part television serial is , of course , based on the masterful novel , of the same name , by british spymeister john lecarre . the novel , itself , was the first of lecarre 's smiley-karla trilogy , that ends with `` smiley 's people . `` and , as the beneficiary of a first-class production by the bbc , `` tinker '' achieves masterpiece status itself . the series , adapted by the talented arthur hopcraft for the screen , follows lecarre 's complex novel rather closely , giving us the intriguing plot developments , the well-rounded characters , and the witty dialogue . furthermore , the bbc hired some of the best available actors for the many principal roles , and surrounded them with all the extras , the cars , and the location shooting any viewer could wish . the plot concerns george smiley , forcibly retired , along with a number of his good-guy friends , from britain 's spy service , called `` the circus '' by le carre . it is realized that there may be , within the spy service , a mole : a term created by lecarre himself to describe a person recruited in the past , and worked into a sensitive position , before being awakened to start reporting on his surroundings . to , in this case , smiley 's opposite number , the feared karla , chief of the ruthless russian spy machine . as it is realized that there is such a person working , and he is responsible for an unthinkably large amount of damage , including the deaths of several spy networks , and the dismissals of smiley and friends , smiley is drafted to locate him . but smiley must work in secret , with only limited help from the official circus . alec guiness plays smiley with an instinctive understanding of the character that has seldom been bettered . he is , as mentioned previously , surrounded by some of the best actors available : bernard hepton as tobe esterhase , chief of the go-to boys ; ian richardson as the mysterious bill haydon , ian bannen as the victimized jim prideaux , alexander knox as control . also michael jayston as peter guillam , smiley 's protege ; anthony bate as oliver lacon , seasoned bureaucratic infighter ; george sewell as inspector mendel ; terence rigby , and michael aldredge . there 's only one casting mis-step ; hywell bennett as ricky tarr , the spy whose unthinking love affair , with a pretty soviet agent , begins the unraveling of the circus 's dark secret . bennett , who was the pretty-boy flavor of the month back then , simply can not hold the screen with all these heavyweights . it requires some patience , and full attention , to follow this intelligent series , that sometimes moves too slowly for american tastes , but those efforts are surely rewarded . this series is john lecarre , and the bbc , at their best . however , you might want to be sure you can watch it on successive nights , rather than as it was originally shown , on a weekly basis : it 's a lot easier on the memory that way .
