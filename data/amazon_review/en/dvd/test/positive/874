an excellent fourth series this series is in my opinion , better than the previous three seasons as the pace is quicker and there are more jokes per minute . the writers were at a creative peak by this point and the show hit its highest ratings in america . the episode - til death do we volley - is an excellent example of how great this season was , it is hilarious from start to finish and full of funny twists . the times when rose begins to tell a st olaf story are often met by much more bitchiness that before and you can see how each character 's personality has been developed since the show started . i ordered this dvd for use in the uk as unfortunately no more series are being released in europe due to poor sales of the previous three . i found that it played fine in my multi-region dvd player , and came with better packaging too
