more than amazing fight choreography this film is a martial arts film , but not a typical one . it does have stunning fight scenes ( the opening will leave you breathless ) , that are fast paced and well thought out . however it is n't all fight scenes , there is a lot of character development with the protaganist ( jet li ) . you see him as a child , and this shows how huo yuan jia 's adult personality and obsession with victory in martial arts are formed . he will go through an incredible transformation before the film 's end and discover the true purpose of martial arts . the story is very effective , and has a good deal of touching moments . jet li fits the role well , and like `` hero '' it shows what a big difference getting to do a part in your mother tongue is . his facial expressions alone tell a lot about the character . target audience : anyone in their teens and above who do n't mind subtitles and enjoy excellent fight choreograpy
