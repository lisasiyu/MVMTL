this movie is beautifully awful . i love this movie . the acting is hilariously bad , the music is great , it 's campy , not realistic at all and i would n't want it any other way . i 've probably seen it 30 times . every time i see something that makes me laugh . nine times out of ten the laughing has nothing to do with the scene being shot to be funny . it 's totally dated and in the dying metal days of the early nineties . i 'd recommend it to musicians totally . just remember that it 's totally terrible in a rocky horror kind of way
