forgotten anderson gem joe 90 is , to american viewers , one of gerry anderson 's best-kept secrets , as , apart from two made-for-cable episode compilations that aired in the early 80s , it has never been broadcast in the usa . this is a shame as this series contains some of the best model work of the entire supermarionation canon . the series is pure fantasy -- just think what the dyfs would do if it found out that a nine-year-old adopted child were acting as a & quot ; most special agent , & quot ; carrying a gun , driving tanks full of explosives , etc.the series is a great deal of fun , and the attention to detail is quite frankly amazing . if one were to watch the series from a distance , one could easily be forgiven in thinking that it has real actors in actual normal-sized sets . although contemporary publicity material claims the series is set about 50 years in the future , ie in 2038 , the fashions , vehicles , etc . are firmly from the 1960s , and easily stands up to the best that british television from this era had to offer . just ignore the fact that the main protagonist is about 2 feet tall and you 'll find the series highly enjoyable.oh , and it 's got a super theme tune , and the remastering is , as george orwell might say , double-plus-excellent . carlton in the uk has removed practically every flaw in the original prints . they are pristine , and look superb on my 32 & quot ; tv
