could be one of the best ... i sat front row for this show in vegas , you even see me about 5 times during the comedy central version of the show . dane even gave me a high 5 ( that missed barely ) and was thankfully cut ... lol . i can tell you the cc version had alot cut out , and was still very funny . i am really looking forward to seeing if the added material is the really rauchy hilarious stuff . sean rouse was just as funny if not better than dane ... but it was very racy ... i 'd definitely buy if that stuff was back in ... probably will anyways to remember my first appearance on comedy central too ! you 'll love it either way , but man i hope they decided to show the whole sets of each guy
