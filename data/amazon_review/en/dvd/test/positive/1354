velcro . nice . i really liked this one , an improvement over the first x-men which was also good . there was plenty of stuff exploding , lots of flying , lots of fighting , snappy dialog , with the characters being just developed enough to fulfill their roles without slowing the pace . patrick stewart shined as always . the sound design was not exactly murch territory but it was basically perfect for an action-blockbuster type of movie , with great balance , and not an over-reliance on dramatic 'over the head ' or ping-pong effects . now for a couple of small cons : a tiny gripe is magneto 's costume , it was incredibly cheap and dumb looking . they did kind of 'save ' this with a line from pyro , but still ... the most interesting opportunity for any actual drama was the subplot about striker 's son , especially as he controlled the illusory little girl , and then he was just gone . i went back and looked for more shots and they just left that story in the dirt . really , probably another thirty seconds on the character and i would n't even complain given that this was an action flick . overall though it was really enjoyable . 'a thrill a minute ' . best line : 'velcro . nice . '
