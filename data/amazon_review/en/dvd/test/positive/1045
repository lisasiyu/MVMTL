romeo must live first of all it has aaliyah in it and for her first movie debut she way over excelled in my opinion . the movie is seious yet it has comedic ways , which i love about it and the actors in it are great at bringing the movie alive , if any of them were to be replaced with someone else it would n't have been the same because they all made it their very own . also the characters in it are very slick and the martial arts is cool , usally i do n't care for martial arts movies , when i 'm watching this i ca n't take my eyes of the screen . if you love comedy , martial arts , and romance you should check this movie out . yet another thing to keep aaliyah 's beautiful legacy alive ! ! ! r.i.p babygirl , fly high with your twenty two doves , you 'll always be forever in my heart ! !
