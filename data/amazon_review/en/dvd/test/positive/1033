good short power yoga routine for building strength first a few words about myself so you can more easily judge if my opinion might be helpful to you or not . i teach power vinyasa yoga at a local hotel spa fitness club . i train every day and prefer complete power yoga flow routines that challange your overall bodystrength a lot and still contribute to every aspect of yoga ( meaning the meditative aspects , proper breathing , inner awareness and so on ) . since i 'm german my english spelling is pretty bad , sorry for that ! about the dvd : the routine is about 25 minutes long but still offers you quite a challange for the short time . i ca n't do 60 to 90 minutes of yoga every day , so i 'm glad to own a couple of shorter programms for the days in between or for early in the morning . rodney yee is a hihgly skilled instructor with a very gentil and calm manner and an interesting style of yoga . his voice is always soothing , but still encouraging . the programm on the dvd is specially challanging for upper body strength but still working the whole body . it 's fluid and , regarding the short time , complete . the only one little thing i can critizise is that the verbal instruction is somtimes not absolutly in line with the instruction on screen . from time to time rodny on screen is movin just a little to fast compared to his verbal instruction . but that 's not very important and does n't cause any problems , so i can still rate this 5 stars . if your looking for a short physicaly demanding power yoga routine , this is for you . it 's not suitable for absolute beginners since rodny moves pretty fast from pose to pose and some are to challanging for an absolute beginner . i would recommend it for intermediate to advanced students . if your interested in more power yoga , check out my other reviews about power vinyasa yoga dvds . to see al dvds i recommend check out my listmania list . let my know if you found the reviews helpfull . i truely hope so ! namast
