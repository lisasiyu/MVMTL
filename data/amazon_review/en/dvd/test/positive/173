7 million dollars at box office-no one was there to see this movie the man who was n't there is a movie by the always unpredictable coen brothers . their movies have such a great variety of topics and genre that it 's fun to see what they 've come up with next . out of the ones i 've seen , my thoughts are mixed . i mean how can you make a goofball hilarious comedy like raising arizona , then one of the best movies of all time with fargo and then go terribly wrong from there ? then you 've got the big lebowski , a movie with a huge cast and huge amounts of cussing and huge amounts of weirdness . not what i call a good movie . then there 's the ladykillers , a ridculous and stupid movie that was a pathetic atempt at doing anything . so they 're just getting worse by age , right ? wait ! let 's go back two years to 2001 . it was in this year that this unheard of movie was made . of course , its originality was probably too intense for most people to handle . and that 's the beauty of this gem . the cinematography . the look of this world and the 1940s feel it 's good is brilliant . but it 's the shadows you see and this cinematography that makes it stand on its own . it is a beautiful movie for that reason and for many others . but first , let 's talk about the plot of the movie . ed crane ( billy bob thorton ) is living in california in the 40s with his wife , doris ( frances mcdormand ) . doris is part of a community that talks and talks . but not ed . ed narrates this story ... his story . he sees it in black and white or maybe that 's the way it really is . you 've got to think . ed is a barber and is proud of his job . he only says a few remarks orally but we hear all of the thoughts in his head through his narration . so here , there is some more originality , brilliance and beauty . when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with her boss , big dave ( james gandolfini ) , he reacts with harshness . he blackmails big dave but something goes wrong . big dave finds out and ed kills him out of defense . and this all happens in the first 30 minutes . doris is accused of doing it and from then on , you 're in for a real treat . when ed is n't narrating , like i already said , he is n't talking . so what he does is smoke , cut hair and listen to a young girl nicknamed birdy ( scarlett johansson ) play piano . her tunes flow through his head all the time and that adds some more beauty . tony shaloub steals the show in his role as lawyer freddy riedenschneider . he 's a big shot who talks and talks . keep an eye out for for his awesome speech with the `` you do n't know '' repeated a bunch of times . believe me , you 'll know when you 're hearing it . the movie is a sad and tragic tale , a tale showing how badly one man 's life can go in a world that is n't for him . he 's different . it 's like he is wearing a hot pink shirt and everyone else is wearing a blue one ... he stands out because he 's different . the man who was n't there is hands down an excellent movie . it is a close second to fargo in the coen 's movies . my last point is that the rating association gets on my nerves . this movie is rated r for a scene of violence ? is that a joke ? that scene was in black and white and showed nothing ! you people really have no idea what you 're doing . pulp fiction ( r ) =the man who was n't there ( r ) get it straight people , your ratings are horrid . james bond flicks have worse content than this .
