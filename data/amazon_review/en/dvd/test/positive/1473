good and underrated this movie features john wayne not as a cowboy but as a football coach . it is not one of his most famous ones probably because it is not the genre of what most fans think of when they think of john wayne , comedy . it is a good movie though . when i first watched it i was amazed . everyone ( from wayne to the actress that plays his daughter ) does an excellent job . john wayne 's first role was in a silent in which he played a football player , and he also played football at usc for a couple of years with ward bond . so it is a subject he knows well . overall , it gives light to a new side of the duke , the comical side ( which is n't bad ) . it is n't one of the best , i grant you , but it is great because it shows duke 's acting talents with a great script and cast
