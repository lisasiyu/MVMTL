underrated , entertaining this is a fine movie that was unfairly panned by critics . there is some clumsiness to it -- the use of flashbacks towards the end does n't work . they seem as thought they were originally written and filmed to be an earlier part of the narrative and then placed at the end to keep the earlier part of the narrative going at the snappy , exciting pace it is in the final movie , and to add a little of that during the final part , which after horn is arrested moves at a slower pace . but the movie is still well-made , well-acted , and plenty entertaining . this is a revisionist western that does n't downplay -- well , does n't downplay excessively -- horn 's stature as a killer of men . in the movie , horn is n't reluctant to fire the first shot , or to keep shooting after a man is down . when one of the cattle rustlers tries to ambush him in town , for example , horn shoots him and as the man is lying in the mud , probably mortally wounded , horn unnecessarily shoots him again . in the film , it is this incident that moves the cattlemen who employ him to sell him out . horn comes off as something of a hapless , easily-manipulated rube in the movie -- which it seems very unlikely he could have been and still be as cagey as he was . he 's an idiot savant , of sorts , a man remarkably gifted when it comes to killing people , but inept at living in the civilized world . when he learns that he is being accused of killing the nickell boy , not only does he diligently avoid proclaiming his own innocence , he goes out of his way at his own trial to annoy everyone and cast even more suspicion on himself . we remain sympathetic to horn , though . when we see him kill , he 's always killing men much , much worse than himself . the world is not a worse place for their departure . and he 's a helluva shot . we americans love a great shot
