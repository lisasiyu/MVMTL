certain shade of green this is a great dvd for any fan . the middle of the show sometimes seems slow , but the 10+ minute version of vitamin is worth the price alone . the extra cd that comes with the dvd is also good for anyone who doesnt have some of the songs in their collection already . `` follow '' is a great song and hopefully their new cd this summer will have more songs like it
