i liked it . worth the $ $ $ to me after reading the many lukewarm reviews here , i did n't have very high expectations for this dvd of a 1998 documentary produced in part to hype the lost in space motion picture released around that time . but after hearing that there was one last scene on here with the 1960s dr. smith and will robinson in character circa 1998 , i knew i had to have this . turned out the documentary itself was n't half as bad as i had been dreading . in fact i 'd say overall it 's pretty decent . yeah , so john laroquette is irrelevant to lis , but i 've seen many other documentaries hosted by people equally unrelated to their subject matter ( -- hell , bill mumy himself sometimes acts as host of biography ) . at least laroquette was n't particularly irritating here like he could have been . maybe if you 're a hardcore lis fan who has read every book and article available on the subject , then there probably wo n't be much new here for you . but as someone who always enjoyed the show but has n't really gotten into the fandom side of things , this documentary was just right for me and i picked up many a new fact here and there ( eg . : john `` star wars '' williams did the music for lis too ? i did not know that . and the guy who did the robot 's voice was a completely different person from the one inside the suit ? i did not know that either . ) it was great seeing the remaining cast members as they looked in 1998 and finding out what they had been doing during all the years since . i also found this documentary very useful when trying to educate friends brand new to the classic lis with more background info on the show . it really helps to show them how important this show is to many people ( yes , i am not a freak for liking this ! ) , and why . after watching this , they are not quite so dismissive of the show and are more willing to try and give it a chance . bonus material includes the original network promo presentation for potential advertisers ( now also available on one of the lis tv show dvds ) , some sfx footage they shot of the giant cyclops for the show 's pilot ( i was surprised it was in colour . did they shoot all the b & w shows in colour first ? ) , and guy williams ' screen test for irwin allen to get the part of prof. john robinson ( my squeaky-clean image of prof. robinson is forever destroyed thanks to a moment when williams seems intent on revealing to irwin allen the tender young age he lost his virginity at . gah ! ) but the real highlight here is of course the scene with will and dr. smith . both actors deliver their lines as convincingly as if they had just walked off the 60s set , and the jupiter ii mock-up they are in looks quite authentic too . the scene is over in a brief couple of minutes and the ending is a little silly , but i have to say it was really great just to get one final glimpse of them . it will be the last , unfortunately , due to the death of jonathan harris just months after . i really wish they had done more like this and sooner , but i guess something is better than nothing ... . so for me , this disc was the perfect way to complete my lis dvd collection . just like the extra disc included especially for the fans in the space 1999 dvd megaset , it adds that last little something extra that 's really nice to have . i think that this is one of those obscure titles that will be highly sought-after by fans after it goes out of print , so grab it while you can . ( -- and for any people reading this from the dvd-making biz , howsabout releasing the episode of the 80s gameshow `` family feud '' that they mention in this documentary , where the cast of lis were guests ? i 'd buy that !
