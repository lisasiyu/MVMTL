not historically accurate , but gripping and moving nonetheless ... in 1955 , playwrites jerome lawrence and robert e. lee published their play , inherit the wind , in response to the anti-communist lynch-mob mentality of the post-wwii/korea era . based in part on the historical events of the 1925 scopes `` monkey '' trial in dayton , tennessee , lawrence and lee delved into the questions of tryanny by the majority and mob rule through the dramatization of the week-long `` circus '' surrounding the trial . the subsequent faithful screen adaptation of the story in 1960 employed not only the explosive dialogues and confrontations of hypocracy of the play but also employed the magnificent performances of acting legends spencer tracy and fredric march . portraying , respectively , rumpled and disheveled defense attorney henry drummond ( clarence darrow in the real-life trial ) and the religious populist and volunteer prosecutor matthew harrison brady ( william jennings bryan ) , this film adaptation grips the imagination and leaves viewers emotionally and physically grasped by the courtroom proceedings and by the various confrontations between the old world that was and the new world that was coming . this film is as compelling today and perhaps moreso than it was when it was first released . anyone wanting to enjoy two bravura performances of two of america 's truly great actors is encouraged to set aside a couple of well-spent hours to watch and experience this film
