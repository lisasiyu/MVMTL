unbelievable acting and cinematography - downright depressing though this movie is going to bring you down . that 's a fact . but it 's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves . a classic tale about men who served in one of the most treacherous environments ever known to man . it 's also hard not to come out of this without a lot of respect for the germans who served in the u boat service
