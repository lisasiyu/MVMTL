more average episodes from the worst season ! the birth of the highlander ! having reached this stage of the 3rd and final season of classic trek , i find myself wishing someone would put this dying horse to sleep out of mercy . it was truly heart-wrenching for this fan of tos to have to make myself watch through the entire 3rd season with its many ups and far too many more downs while remembering the great acting , scriptwriting and overall quality of the first two seasons and here in what would be the 3rd last volume of the 3rd season , we get two average quality episodes . for the first episode , `` the way to eden '' , one has to put the episode and hence the story into the context of the times i.e . 1969 . obviously , taken in today 's context the episode is ridiculously bad but for an audience in 1969 , the plot has deep meaning what with the civil rights movement and the growing dissension against the vietnam war , that audience could definitely relate to this parable of those very troubling events of their time . viewed from that context , i think this is actually not too bad an episode which tries to show the points of view of the various parties involved : the demonstrators ( adam and the rest ) , the sympathisers ( spock ) and the non-sympathisers ( scott and kirk ) . i thought taken as an overall episode , this metaphor of the major civil demonstrations of the late 60 's was very good . the moral is that one should fight for what is right but one should also beware of being made a tool for someone else 's agenda who may not have as pure an intention as you . so why do i still rate this average ? because , i too did n't like the far too frequent outbreaks of pop ditties ala love or the zombies that adam breaks into . still , an average episode overall . for the second episode , there were some pluses and some minuses as well . the plot that sounds a lot like the idea from which the whole `` highlander '' series came about is a good one but what i do n't understand is why daly 's character becomes jealous of kirk and an android ! also , just because a man is immortal why does that automatically make him have to be the greatest geniuses of history ? this is why the `` highlander '' series that this episode spawned is far more believable for me ; that individual was just a normal immortal trying hard to suppress his immortality to avoid persecution and not einstein or newton or my grandpa . still , for giving us the whole `` highlander '' premise , this makes it to the average category of me . overall , this volume falls under the `` nice to have but not essential '' category if you are deciding which volumes to keep
