maybe eduardo sanchez has a future in horror ! picked this dvd up on a whim . i personally had n't heard anything about it , but i saw it was directed by one of the guys who co-wrote and co-directed ( whatever that means ) the blair witch project . that 's not great , but it was something to go on . in the very least it promised that the storyline might be innovative . i thought altered was really good ! it 's a pretty simple plot : three hicks , who have been hunting aliens for seven years , finally catch one and take it to their friend 's house . the friend , wyatt , has had contact with the aliens before , having been abducted nearly fifteen years ago . most of the hijinks involves these four guys wyatt 's girlfriend and the abducted alien . the story is sort of derivative , combining elements from night of the living dead , the original alien and maybe a dash of signs . but this managed to take those pieces and still make a highly suspenseful film ! the characters were fleshed out just enough where you cared what happened to them . honestly adam kaufman 's wyatt stole the show . the man has charisma . as for the rest , in this day and age where every horror character is a sassy b*tch , it was nice to see dialog that was restrained and functional . they still managed to sneak a few jokes in , but they were so subtle and/or situational that it worked pretty well . the only one who comes across as an amateur is the girlfriend . i 've seen oak trees that were less wooden than her delivery . still , considering this was a nobody , no publicity , nothing , straight to video indie flick i 'm surprised at how good she was in comparison to other similar projects . the special effects were pretty good . everything was hand made special effects , so you do n't have any of that fakey cgi smeared around . movies ten times the budget have n't learned that lesson yet . the character design for the alien was pretty good . it sported an animatronic face and probably a small , athletic bloke in a rubber suit with the result being some of the best monster realism since aliens . the best part was the disembowel scene ; realistic without being disgusting , a chuckling that's- got ta -hurt moment if i ever saw one . really , this was a pleasant surprise , given where the sequel to the blair witch went . maybe eduardo sanchez has a future in horror after all
