good movie it 's amazing to me what some people will say about movies and most of it does n't make sense . i bought this movie because it had a very beautiful woman who 4 years later land a usage role in a classic tv show . robert stack plays the role of captain larkin , hugh o'brien plays the role of detective daniel myerson , and the beautiful young women was farrah fawcett majors who played the role of karen white . this was your typical airplane movie where it took about 15 minutes or more to set up everybody roles that would occur on the flight 502 . after the jumbo jet takes off captain larkin gets a radio call from security in new york city . first , a box was found in the first class section that security thought it was a bomb that turned out to be a smoking jack in the box . next security finds a note in the lounge with an ominous message left by a passenger threatening to kill some of the passengers . at first , it is thought to be a sick joke , but soon a man posing as a priest and a flight attendant are killed . it is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases . all and all the weasel gives this movie 8 star . as far as farrah fawcett majors goes , she did a great job at being the flight attendant in charge .
