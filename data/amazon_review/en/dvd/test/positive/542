lotr i loved these movies , and watched the extended versions but preferred to purchase these ones because , i didnt read the books , so its just the movies for me , i think the extended version and extras are for book fans . its a little weird that the fellowship of the rings doesnt have spanish subtitles but the other two did ... i dont know why ... but good collection , great story , good performances , amazing music , incredible scenes ...
