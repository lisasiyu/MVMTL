happiness is -to follow that dream the story of a squatter family is a rollicking success . arthur o'connell as the pappy is hilarious . the dialogue is cleaver and elvis plays the roll of an innocent , not very well educated young beefcake to perfection . the laughter starts as the movie begins to roll and continues throughout . there are not many songs in the movie by elvis does sing the beautiful `` angel '' to a starry eyed anne helm . i found that the 97 minutes flew by and the movie had a `` feel good '' effect on me . the true sign of good entertainment .
