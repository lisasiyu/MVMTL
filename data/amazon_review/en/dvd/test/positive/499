absolute excellence throne of blood is a masterpiece by one of the world 's greatest film makers at the height of his powers . only kurosawa could take the essence of shakespearian stage drama and incorporate it into the medium of film as a dynamic tour de force . yet at the same time he remains faithful to elements of noh ( a stagy traditional japanese play-form in which design and movement are minimalized ) . a seeming contradiction , dynamism and static-ness yet kurosawa masters both in the same medium . as usual ; acting , writing , cinematography , sound , direction and production are all pitch perfect . in this second shakespearian based film by kurosawa , focus is on the interplay of fate , free will and the fine thread the human psyche uses to weave the two together . on a more simpler level it is a man living and dying by the sword . in short what goes around comes around . what comes around for toshiro mifune as he gets his just deserts is a scene with straight as an arrow , perfect direction by kurosawa leading to quite a pointed culminatin of events ( pun intended ... see the movie you 'll understand ) . bonus features include excellent linear notes as well as the superb commentary of donald richie . few people are more knowledgeable about film and japanese film then he . the commentary is almost as interesting as the movie itself . as usual criterion presents its film in pristine condition . some may complain that criterion is too pricey but with them you get the best cinema has to offer . you can not go wrong . one kurosawa masterpiece packs more poignancy , punch and philosophy then 10 lesser films thus you get 10 times the movie at 5 times the price , really quite a deal if you look at it that way .
