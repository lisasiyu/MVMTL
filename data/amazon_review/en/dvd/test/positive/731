contains the best song in the world 's : tribute ! this duo led by jack black is flipping sweet ! jack 's sax-a-boom absolutely rips the audience into shreds . this is fun music . ( not for the kids ' ears , per se , but if they 're teens i 'll bet they 've already borrowed the album from a friend that has older siblings that grow weed and otherwise contribute to your kids ' delinquency . buy this so when you catch them listening to the album you can both sit down together and really bond over some cool tunes .
