munich zauberflote stands test of time while many traditional productions of opera these days look sleepy , either on a stage loaded with so much trappings and clutter , and/or looking as though a group of singers got dropped onto stage and left to their own devices , this is truly a most traditional production , in both all its consummate detail and inspired individual touches . a certain degree of realism and social commentary inform the august everding production here . sarastro 's temple is set in solemnly austere design of dark brick and wood , which opens out into a silhouetted relief of what could pass for a greek temple and also imaginatively to a decrepit looking courtyard , where tamino faces his trial of silence , which gives us a hint that sarastro 's temple may have seen better days . a certain rigid manner about two of sarastro 's priests also tell us as much ( and who are denied their brief act two duet ) . for the incidents of extra magic that occurs in this production , and that mozart would have been happy with , in contradicting the cold reason of the enlightenment , the scenes that take place with the courtyard set just mentioned practically dare you to blink , not to miss anything . i do not want to give away any secrets here , except that wolfgang brendel , as papageno , in some of the action here , and everywhere , makes up for a few dry spots vocally , by perfectly natural acting of his part . costumed as a simple warning man or peasant , he works very well , in interaction with everyone else , in capturing the full humor of his part . brighter evocations of nature make up very pleasant backdrop for a couple of scenes during the finale to act two , for pamina and the 3 boys and for papageno alone , right before meeting up with papagena in front of a curtain backdrop of a giant oak . the temple , silhouetted before , opens out , suffused with cool light , as kurt moll as sarastro blesses his two new initiates , pamina and tamino . lucia popp , as pamina , is practically enough reason for giving this zauberflote the highest possible acclaim and for why this belongs in every serious opera dvd collection . take for instance her opening of `` ach ich fuhls '' in act two , which immediately touches the chord or setting for what the entire rest of the aria will be like , which she continues to sing most expressively . her scene , with the three boys is at least equally sublime in making her way from total despondency , despair to joyful anticipation of meeting tamino again , consummated by her utterly exquisite `` tamino mein '' , upon finally greeting him , and radiant demeanor in helping the tamino of francisco ariaza bring the trials of fire and water and their vocal parts to a close . her acting matches that of wolfgang brendel in their act one scenes together , in complete believability . lucia popp , as many fans already know , was some sixteen years before , a queen of the night of classic status on the otto klemperer zauberflote ( with all spoken dialogue taken out ) for emi . eschewing the least bit of any exaggeration or hindrance to full expressivity of her lines , edita gruberova ideally , coolly yet imperiously picks up the mantle popp had held for the part of the queen of the night before , in her musical and dramatic authority in it . her sidekick trio of three ladies ( pamela coburn , cornelia wulkopf , daphne evangelatos ) are as fine vocally and musically , among video choices , as you will find . while perfectly seductive enough and costumed to be very attractive to the eye , this trio is perhaps a little less menacing than one other out there . francisco araiza , hardly more than a dutiful presence on stage dramatically , and with slight tendency to pout a few more dramatic lines in his part , warmly and elegantly spins out so many lyric lines here , with so much more colorful command of nuance here than found with peter schreier on sawallisch 's cd set or his own much drier , less interesting contribution for james levine on the met dvd . kurt moll is the warm voiced sarastro , his voice rolling effortlessly through `` in diesen heil'gen hallen '' and with expressive point both here and the other passages for him . a certain fire about his look or gaze informs even those moments of warmth to convey to pamina his genuine forbearance in looking out after her . he reappears in the met zauberflote dvd eight or nine years later , with undiminished feeling of authority in the part , except for some obvious graying of his vocal prowess and a certain detached manner about him , that had me thinking that all this business with initiates and trials must be incredibly passe or perhaps long by now routinely and terribly de riguer for sarastro . jan-hendrik rootering is the ample voiced and authorative speaker of the temple , norbert orth the entirely black faced and mostly sweet voiced monostatos , if a little less menacing than one or two others on video by now . choral forces , including for a properly majestic rendition of and processional up high and stage rear for `` o isis und osiris '' , and supporting cast are all in top form . i am not quite entirely sure , even after reading the annotation in the well informative liner notes ( in nice booklet form ) of the changing places between sarastro 's aria `` o isis und osiris '' and the brief trio with pamina , and tamino joining him , that doing this is right , but at least it is well accounted for in the liner notes and may persuade some viewers . wolfgang sawallisch leads a pleasing middle-of-the-road interpreation of this score , levelheaded in almost all choices of tempo and modern , yet supple enough in its simple pacing of so much , yet plush in orchestral sonorities , even with incidences of doubtful intonation from woodwinds . he is always very supportive of his singers , if not the last word in being imaginative with so much that this score has to offer . he improves on his earlier analogue set ( that has been reissued on cd ) in having a more varied cast here , in terms of vocal color , without losing out on issues of diction and meaningful interaction between cast members . an overriding blandness , sterility both scenically and musically to the levine/met zauberflote on dvd , also on dgg , helps to make the sawallisch here a clearly preferable choice . ultimately , as well supported by sawallisch , the expert staging here , and the contributions of just about every cast member , humanity emerges as the highest and most prevailing order in society , in place of a clerical , monastic , or even a masonic one . the complexity of mozart 's vision is as well encapsulated here as may also be the case in one or two auteur productions of this great work . here the charm of mozart 's inspiration endures from start - traffic signals both to left and right from a moon-silhouetted queen of the night in alt - to finish
