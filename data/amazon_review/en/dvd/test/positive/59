shamefully overlooked southern gothic murder mystery has atmosphere , genuine thrills and the superb blanchett this is surely one of the most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around , which is a shame since director sam raimi , just before hitting the jackpot with the `` spider-man '' franchise , has assembled a wildly improbable cast to inhabit an admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie . i was in a town on the southernmost tip of chile when i first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have hbo . not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the tv set back then . co-written by billy bob thornton ( upon whose mother 's psychic gifts the story is based ) and tom epperson , the plot revolves around the disappearance of jessica starlet , the daughter of a wealthy resident of a georgia backwater town . tired of blind alleys , the police begrudgingly recruit annie wilson , a single mother of three sons , who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller . annie thinks she finds a suspect in donnie barksdale , the abusive , white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers , valerie . complicating matters for annie is her attraction to wayne collins , her eldest son 's teacher and jessica 's fiancee ; and buddy cole , another of annie 's customers , a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child . while it 's not perfectly constructed , the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters ' voices and motivations throughout . raimi 's expert direction is full of sumptuous southern gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story . credit needs to be given to jamie anderson 's cinematography and neil spisak 's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot . some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns , including katie holmes as the spoiled , baby-faced debutante jessica ; greg kinnear as the seemingly stalwart wayne ; keanu reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater donnie ; and giovanni ribisi as the deeply troubled buddy . in the smallish role of valerie , hilary swank makes her moments count as she cringes from donnie 's scarifying dominance over her . but it 's the wondrous cate blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as annie . with a convincing southern accent , she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband , protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us . the dvd is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews , the movie 's trailer and a video of neko case 's `` furniture room lullaby '' which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack . definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric , character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer
