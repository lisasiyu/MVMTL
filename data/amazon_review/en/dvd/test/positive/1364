quite the little head trip . swimming pool explores some very interesting themes : the differences between youth and age , innocence , sexual awakening , motherhood , solitude , and voyeurism , among others . the plot is deceivingly simple . sarah , a writer , is staying at her editor 's house in france so she can work on her next novel . she 's had a great deal of success as a mystery writer , but seems to have hit a wall . she does n't want to do another mystery , but she does n't know what else to write about . enter julie , the editor 's daughter . she breezes into the house one night like a force of nature . her first order of business ? she uncovers the swimming pool in the backyard . it 's full of leaves , but this does n't stop her from peeling her clothes off and swimming in it . she also takes to sunbathing topless and having sex in the living room on a nightly basis , with whatever men she can talk into coming home with her . sarah is disgusted by all of this behavior at first , but as time goes by , she becomes captivated by it . she creates a 'julie ' file on her computer , and she starts writing again . but there 's a lot more going on under the surface . what is fantasy ? what is reality ? is the movie just a product of sarah 's imagination ? are sarah and julie linked in some way , and if so , how ? what the hell is going on ? francois orzon , in an interview with indie wire , had this to say : `` i do n't want to give you the key . i myself have an opinion about it , obviously -- but i wanted to keep the film open-ended and let every viewer imagine what he wishes . it 's a movie that gives viewers the freedom to make their own film . '' so essentially the meaning of the movie is left for you to decipher . i 'm not sure how i feel about that . it does n't really seem like good storytelling , and it would be disastrous if every director in the world started doing this . but orzon is n't every director , and swimming pool is n't an ordinary movie . i found myself thinking about it a lot once i had ejected the dvd , turning the facts over in my mind and trying to make them fit into some kind of coherent storyline . it 's strangely satisfying to do this , and i seriously suggest that you watch the film so you can do the same . my only complaint is that the dvd features were sparse - just a trailer and a few deleted scenes that did n't seem to add much . there was n't any director 's commentary , which irked me to no end . i would have loved to hear orzon 's take on the rather bizarre series of events , but no such luck . oh , and should you pick up the unrated version , be prepared for a lot of ludivine sagnier 's breasts . they should have been given second billing for all their screen time
