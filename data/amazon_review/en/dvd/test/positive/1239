an incredible movie and riveting performance i do n't think i 've ever rented a movie twice before , but i did rent `` lost '' twice . and now , on top of that , i 've bought it . for me , that 's a lot of money , and a lot of time , to spend on a single movie . in this case , it 's more than worth it . i 've never seen anything like this movie . it absolutely gripped me . the performance by dean cain was so real , so utterly convincing , that it is hard for me to escape the idea that it all actually happened to him , personally . and nothing anyone else did in the movie detracted from that sense that i was watching real events unfold and spiral out of control . i 've seen one person shows before but they were always the type where the audience is very aware that it is a performance . you know the type of thing i 'm talking about - a venerable actor on a stage - perhaps a stool and a glass of water - a bare card table - a spotlight ... this was virtually a one person performance but i did n't even realize it until a day or two after the first time i watched it . the fact that dean cain carries the whole movie is n't necessarily obvious because it is n't the point of the movie . the writing , photography , directing and acting ( especially the acting ) are so layered , nuanced , complex , rich , that it satisfies on every emotional and intellectual level , without additional on-screen characters , or glitzy locations . if this movie strikes a chord in someone , as it did in me , the bleakness of the landscape , the heat , the sun 's passage across the sky , the weather changes , all become internalized . their shifts will become your shifts , and you may feel the connections of the land to the character and events as they become a part of you . you may experience the longings and desires , the sadnesses and fears , that led to the passing moments , and underlie them . and you may not be able to shake them .
