killer action & comedy ! mr. and mrs. smith , a suburban couple who live in a large and beautiful house on a quiet street , have been keeping a rather large secret from one another - they are both actually assassins working for rival organizations . when the two are sent on the same job and unexpectedly discover the true nature of their respective professions , they wage war on each other , which eventually destroys the not so happy home they 've been trying so hard to maintain . however , when it becomes clear that their bosses want them eliminated , they realize they have to turn to each other . overall , mr. and mrs. smith is a mixture of very dark comedy and some well put together action sequences that deliver a well rounded movie going experience , but , there 's some definite flaws here - some common sense issues , not to mention that there 's no real villain - but the battle between brad pitt and angelina jolie - verbal and otherwise - manages to carry the picture to it 's conclusion
