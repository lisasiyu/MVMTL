caution - may be dangerous to your health ! when darkwing duck first aired on television , i was recuperating from a broken back and on some really good meds . i laughed so hard that i nearly did myself another injury . now the first season is available on dvd , and i am here to tell you that even without the meds , darkwing is still hilarious . my youngest granddaughter and i have watched them all , together , and she loves to `` get dangerous .
