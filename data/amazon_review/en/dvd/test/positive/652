a landmark film ! this surrealist picture is a magical mysterious tour around a bizarre world where the emotions have been lessened for the social conventionalisms , the double moral , the frivolity , epidemical visions , unresolved gilts , an easy going approach that do not seem to be so far of rabelais or moliere . one of the freest films in any age and a milestone reference picture . another sublime artistic feat of federico fellini ; these dilemmas , far from being diminishing , have been growing up , what it proves its magisterial precognition and penetrating sights in the social body . a must see !
