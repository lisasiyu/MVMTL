eddie murphy makes it work : animal lovers will love this set in san francisco and not england , the american dr. dolittle is just as comical as the original british vetrinarian in the 1960 's muscial . when dr. dolittle 's animal telepathic skills resurface he not only is sent to a mental institution but he ends up having to save a circus tiger 's life . this california rendition complete with scenic shots of the bay area , is a departure from the children 's books , but succeeds in its key message : either be yourself or nothing at all even if the mass population thinks you 're crazy . not being true to yourself is the direct route to driving you truly crazy
