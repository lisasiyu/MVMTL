depp and walken in real-time suspense johnny depp 's character is coerced into in assassination plot by a corrupt government agent played by christopher walken . i like this movie . i think some of it is a little far fetched , but i like that it tries to tell the story in real time . it helps put you in the situation and adds to the suspense . and the situation is a tough one to get out of , with seemingly omniscient antagonists that deny his every attempt to free his captive daughter through means other than complying with their criminal demands . i think what appeals to me most is he 's alone against the world and your right there with him . he 's an ordinary guy put in an extroardinary situation , and the audience is taken along for the ride as he struggles to find a way
