interesting , thought provoking film the previews for this film caught my attention , so i rented it as soon as it came out . it was a very interesting and thought provoking film . how would three people with different languages and different cultures interact , especially if two of them are enemies ? this film explores that question . the performances were outstanding , and the film was beautifully and artisticly done . much of it was very funny , as the audience is let in on both what was being said and what was thought to be being said . one example of this is ivan being called gerlost as if that is his name because he is always telling veiko to get lost . even people who speak the same language have a hard time communicating . while this film is rated pg-13 , parents of older teens ought to preview it separately so as to make an informed decision as to whether they want their older teens to see it ( i would n't ) . this is because of some issues of religion and morality ( to say more would give to many plot spoilers ) .
