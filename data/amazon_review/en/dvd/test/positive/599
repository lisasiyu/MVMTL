as good as season one -- with more twists -- no spoilers in this review my son and i watch lost together , one or two episodes at a time , on dvd to avoid commercials and to keep the plot continuity that is hard to do when you are watching weekly on tv . after we finished season one , we did n't think it would be possible for season two to match it . however , it did not disappoint . it 's hard to write a review of lost without throwing in spoilers , but i 'm going to try to give the essence of season two without ruining any of the secrets . season two finds the survivors of oceanic flight 815 uncovering more secrets about 'the others ' . there are additional characters . i wo n't say where they come from , but be prepared for a shock . each lost character carries personal baggage , has what might be called a tragic flaw , and in season two , these flaws begin to get larger on some and to be overcome by some . also , some characters deviate from what makes them good and become almost bad . the writing and acting are outstanding . it never ceases to amaze me how much of the acting on lost is not spoken . the characters give 80 % of their communication and clues about themselves through the way they react before speaking , or their body language , even such little things as a raised eyebrow . this minimalist dialog requires great acting , and the lost cast is one of the best . they certainly justify what must be a gargantuan payroll for the producers . there are more twists and turns on season two than season one , which had to spend more time on character development . be prepared to go back and see flashbacks from season one in more detail , or from the angle of another person , and also be prepared for sequences that cross levels of consciousnes -- some where you think the character is dreaming , but is n't , and some where you think the characters are acting , but are dreaming . great color , sound , location , scripting , acting , suspense . highly recommended . five stars
