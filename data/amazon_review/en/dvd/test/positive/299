nearly as good as the grammy winning cd wow - can these guys play . lukather the `` childish '' , noisy one , carlton the `` mentor '' with lots of elegance . but please : remember to buy the duo 's grammy award winning cd `` no substitutions '' produced buy steve vai and lukather . the cd is even better than the dvd . the song lists are about identical - and carlton 's solo after exactly 8 min.s on the cd is just ... fantastic ! ! !
