inspiring and artistic - peacefull and magnificent at last ! one film with no fearfull scenes - ( to be entertained doesnt mean someone needs to be frightened.. ) no nightmares , ... ! at last no unnecessary stupid killing . innocent just like a kids heart . beautifull images original imagination , ... . inspiring ! so artistic ... all that critic others wrote , just has to do with technical stuff . kids dont see a film criticizing it - they watch it with their feeling , and this film is full of love , piece , honesty and respect , hurt and loss.. about feelings . so natural ... .not overplayed ! . i dont want steril films that just keep my eye busy .. and i really dont think this film is in any way threatening to democratic beleifs ... ! ! ! i would say it gives kids the sense of authority ... like their parents authority . i liked that the bad charakters werent over-the-top bad - they were just like people in reality are . they werent unnaturaly `` absolute '' bad guys and good guys . kids need to learn these things . that there arent just bad guys and just good guys . they need to see that good guys can do bad things and bad guys arent always totally bad guys but can be good also.. i loved dinotopia and am gratefull that i had a chance to see it . will see the other movies with dinotopia too..
