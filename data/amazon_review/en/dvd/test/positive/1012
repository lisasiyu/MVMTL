a ton of fun for film buffs since `` the fugitive '' is one of my all-time favorites , this takeoff on it was a lot of fun for me to watch . hey , sometimes it 's best to laugh at ourselves and the things we like . for much of it , this movie was laugh-out-loud funny . it helped not only to know `` the fugitive '' story well but also `` north by northwest , '' `` casablanca '' `` titantic , '' `` star wars '' and many , many other films , both classic and modern-day . the more familiar you are with movies , the more of these `` inside '' jokes are going to make you laugh . being a movie buff , a lot of these gags connected and made me really have a good time watching this leslie nielsen farce . be warned , parents : this is not a family comedy . there are tons of sexual innuendos , so typical of today 's comedies ... .but overall , this is really funny stuff and highly recommended if you watched a lot films in your lifetime
