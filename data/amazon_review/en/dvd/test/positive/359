perfect platinum edition and worth collecting to all bambi fans ! when i first saw the cover of this special edition , i anticipated that it would be the best ever . when i received and watched it , i found it was perfect , even better off than my anticipation ! it was perfect , glorious , wonderful , splendid , fantastic ... oh , i think it can be described with many , many good words ! when i received this special edition , i was a little disappointed to the surface of the discs , because the pattern on them were not so pretty . but needless to say , the movie is , and will always be classic . however , in this special edition , the movie tableaux became more clear , but , in my opinion , the original tableaux were better , because they gave me very classic feeling . i had watched this movie when i was very , very young , and i had almost forgotten what was it about ! but now , this platinum edition reminded me not only the plots of the movie but also some beautiful memories in my childhood ! just as my anticipation , many wonderful things were in disc 2 ! my favourite parts were deleted scenes and the making of bambi . bambi was one of the cutest disney characters in my opinion , and through these 2 parts , i knew how bambi was created and something i 've never known about bambi . the part which attracted me most was the legacy continues , the trailer of `` bambi-2 '' . i was excited to see this ! if it was n't for this , i would n't know `` bambi-2 '' which was so wonderful would be published ! the part which entertained me much was the personality profile game called what 's your season . just like the fact , my season is summer , my favourite season ! and the animated short named the old mill was so beautiful too ! there were many interesting and attractive things in this 2-disc special edition , everything in it will entertain you much . it will make you to love this beloved movie more and more ! and i think it will make you to wait for `` bambi-2 '' expectantly
