love love love this movie i have always been a big fan of bette midler , goldie hawn and diane keaton , i bought the picture when it first came out on vhs . i think i viewed it to many times because the picture and sound quality began to fade , thus i looked all over the country side for the dvd version to no avail , so i decided to order it from amazon.com only to find it on the shelf at target a few weeks later but i do n't regret my purchase , thanks guys . i 'm sure i will enjoy it for many years to come . it 's such a funny and dramatic picture
