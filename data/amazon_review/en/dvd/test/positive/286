rattle , hum & chill out i 've read reviews about rattle 'n ' hum for years now . everybody gets caught up in the mania of the movie . honestly , who cares whether or not bono makes a fool of himself ( which he so eloquently does ) , who cares that this is their pilgrimage to the `` holy lands '' of rock . if you can strip away all the symbolic sludge and get to the heart of this movie , it 's at that point that you can truly enjoy it . rattle 'n ' hum is nothing more than an entertaining documentary of the journey of a simple rock band from dublin ireland . their music and concerts are uplifting and their songs are incredibly simple , yet well-written . by the end of the movie , hopefully you will appreciate the fact that u2 always has proven themselves as a solid rock band worthy of the musical acclaim that has followed them throughout their long distinguished career . forget the politics , forget the philanthropy , forget the garbage . just listen to the music and enjoy the visual ride . it 's only rock'n'roll
