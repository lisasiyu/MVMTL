i disagree after reading the reviews above i decided to chime in with my two cents . although i agree joe public may find this movie a bit dry and at times unrealistic i must say that this is an unfair assesment and that the film has it 's audience . currently i am working on my masters in psychology and i must say that the depiction of an individual who is seriously considering suicide is far more accurate than most films today . despite popular opinion , those who attempt suicide are rarely brudding goths who always see the more morbid side of things and listen to metallica . they are generally normal people who just feel tired and lost , something that paul rudd brings across in spades . although they seldom film their deaths , most suicide attempties do discuss killing themselves and are often aware of how `` indulgent '' it may seem to others , a point discussed in the film . thus it is unfair to say that this movie is bad based on a half founded belief that the content is unrealistic
