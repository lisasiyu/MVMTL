enjoyable and entertaining : a fun watch ! `` shinobi-heart under blade , '' is a fun and entertaining film . suspension of disbelief is a necessary ingredient for the film ; and if you have viewed azumi 1 & 2 , or takeshi kitano 's film `` the blindswordman zatoichi , '' then you will enjoy this film . i was given this film by a friend as a christmas present , and just recently viewed it ; and i must write that i found it highly enjoyable . there is cgi in the film , but it did not bother me , considering the abilities of the various ninja 's depicted in the film would more or less require its use . also , the story itself is based from japanese manga , called `` basilisk . '' and although i have not had a chance to look at these , i might someday . just thought that i would pass this along . the film is set in 17th-century japan . in the film there are two shinobi ninja tribes whose villages have been at war for hundreds of years . the two tribes are called the iga and the kouga . they have been forced to obey a decree by the shogun who has unified japan , and therefore has outlawed these two factions from fighting . two of the ninja 's from the different tribal clans have fallen in love : they are oboro ( yukie nakama ) and gennosuke ( jo odagiri ) however , both must keep it a secret . the shogun however , sees the danger that these two warring ninja clans are to him , and decides that a tournament be held . five ninja warriors from each of the two clans must face off in a battle to the death . these different ninja characters are extremely colorful . each possess an ability in fighting that makes this film interesting . as i wrote in the beginning , this is not an akira kurosawa type film , such as `` seven samurai , '' therefore , suspension of disbelief is necessary . moreover , you will not find the depth of character development in this film that you would in a kurosawa film : so what ! the film is a fun watch anyway . i would have liked to have seen more a bit more depth in the characters in the film , however , i can live with this , as the film was entertaining enough for me to enjoy . however , the acting in the film is very good . since the film comes from comic and anime origins , the characters do not dissapoint the viewer . the film seems a bit comic-book at times , but that is one of the reasons i think i enjoyed the film so much more . and besides , the visuals i believe were done incredibly great . also , while not like your typical japanese film , in terms of swordplay , the film is still enjoyable : remember this does derive from manga . in the film these two ninja clans that send their ninjas understand the implications of their fight : the winners will serve the shogunate , the loser will be vanquished . all of the fights take place while enroute to the capital , while the leader of one of the clans tries to persuade the emperor to change his mind . ( jo odagiri ) and ( yukie nakama ) give good acting perfomances in the film , which in turn makes this a better film . once can see clearly that this film is adapted from 'romeo and juliet , ' to some degree . once again , this is an enjoyable japanese film , not to be taken seriously , or on par with some of the great samurai epics of the past , just an enjoyably entertaining film . also , i thought some of the characters ' powers , such as one ninja being able to slow down time were interesting , as it departs so much from much of japanese cinema , in contrast to chinese cinema , where this is so prevalent . all in all , a delightful and fun film . enjoy it , and do n't take it too seriously .
