how can you be brainwashed by your own mother ? a rather melodramatic rewriting of a plot that could have been produced by tennessee williams . the black widow of a mother who only lives and marries to get a son and put her hands on a big agricultural - or so - estate will not hesitate to kill and then she brainwashes her own son into believing his father died in some kind of an accident . what happens when this son gets married and is expecting a child from his newly wed wife ? the attachment of the son to his mother is shown as perverse and leading to the rejection of the wife , of the mother of the baby to come . then it melodramatically develops into a new criminal affair and the son finds then the courage , in the name of his wife and child , to break off and go . there is something incestuous and insane in this mother and the film sounds sad and unhappy , in spite of the positive ending . a son , a man , a human being in general can not live as a human being if he or she rejects his or her parents utterly . this is hatred and hatred is nothing but the perversion of love and hatred makes love impossible . a man or woman who hates can not love anyone properly and rejects herself or himself out of society . hatred is psychotic and leads , sooner or later , to murder and death . dr jacques coulardeau , university of paris dauphine & university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
