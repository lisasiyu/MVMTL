my feet and quads thank you ! i bought this dvd last year and when i fell off of the exercise wagon , this was relegated to a drawer in the entertainment center . after doing a kathy smith weight lifting routine last night , i picked this back up to stretch right before bed with the pm routine . i 'm 32 , and have been underweight and very flexible my entire life . but even i needed improvement , and along with cardio and weight training , i 've incorporated yoga and pilates into my recently revived exercise routine . my feet hurt from high heels . my quads are too weak , and i fear hurting my knees until my quads are stronger . the stretches in the pm section for the quads and feet ( love the massage ! ) were so good that for those reasons alone i 'm committing to doing this every night to get the day 's kinks out . lewis instructs you to start a stretch , contract a muscle , and then deepen the stretch . i have n't seen this technique anywhere else , and i think it 's a wonderful method for improving flexibility . unfortunately , it 's only noon right now and nowhere near bedtime . i 'm already looking forward to doing this one again . one day i 'll get up early enough to do the am routine ... .
