i so loved this movie so much ! this movie is so comforting to me . its sweet , funny and def . gives you a message . no matter how green the grass may seem ( a man that has a lot on his plate : kevin bacon is on the verge of a affair with a pretty young woman ) it 's not always . moral of the story is you need to go with your heart . he realized at the end that his wife and baby on the way meant more to him that reconnecting with his `` single self '' i absolutely love this movie . love the music , love the actors , love the scenes where bacon and his wife are trying to have a baby . too funny ! : )
