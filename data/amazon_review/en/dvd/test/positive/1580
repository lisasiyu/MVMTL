i have to go with an a for effort . i 've had this movie since it was first released and yes i laughed at various parts of the movie when the cgi just was so painfully obvious bad . and yes i could rip the movie apart just like you can rip any big budget hollywood production apart , but here was a movie that did their best to stay true to well 's story . if you are a lover of the book then i believe this is a must see movie , now if you can get over the movies flaws and enjoy it 's content ... . that i leave to you and i relly hope you can cuase they get an a for effort from me .
