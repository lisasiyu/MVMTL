overhyped cult film finally makes good . i 'd seen this film before , in a lesser unrestored edition , and was n't that impressed . sure there 's some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two , but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull . hardly the unintentional laugh riot it 's reputed to be . thanks to mike nelson 's biting commentary , however , now the film really is funny . damn funny . which is why i demand we pass legislation , the sooner the better , requiring mike nelson commentaries on every major dvd release from here on out . he may be hollywood 's last best hope , the only man who can save excrement like mission impossible 3 and lady in the water from heading straight to the bargain racks . ( okay , maybe i 'm overrating mike 's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an old testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of lady in the water - but if lucas gave him a crack at episodes 1-3 , i think we 'd be looking at pure marketing gold . c'mon lucas , you know you ca n't resist any excuse to re-release yet another dvd version of your little sci-fi sextology . give the man a call .
