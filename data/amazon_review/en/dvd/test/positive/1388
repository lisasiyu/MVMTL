# 25 : another excellent zatoichi episode the 25th episode of zatoichi finds the ever humble blind masseur on his way to his hometown . it has been years since zatoichi has visited his family ; and with a toss of a coin , the protagonist finds himself back to a different village that he left many years before . one of the changes zatoichi finds is that he has a sister who was raised by the same woman who raised him . only the old woman is now deceased : zatoichi has been away far too long . also , zatoichi meets a man who grew up with him as a young boy . this man is now a corrupt government official . when zatoichi is giving this friend a massage , the official says that he does not know zatoichi , yet ichi knows that the official is lying . ichi relates what they did as children , and still the official rebuffs him . the official is not only corrupt , but he has no honor and decency . the official is attempting to claim the village 's quarry , which is the main source of income for the people who live there . and this angers zatoichi . one of the greatest actors in cinema history also makes his appearance in the film . takashi shimura -- of the famed `` seven samurai '' and `` ikiru '' by akira kurosawa , portrays the old man who is watching over the new-found sister of zatoichi . takeshi shimura has always been my favorite actor , and it was wonderful to see him in this episode of zatoichi . the conclusion of the film is a strange one , which i do not wish to give away . however , zatoichi confronts his old childhood friend . and as he does he struggles with the problem of whether or not to kill him . this is an excellent zatoichi episode . the cinematography is great , and the character actors in the film -- especially the corrupt official -- are great . i highly recommend this great episode of `` zatocihi 's conspiracy '' to all viewers .
