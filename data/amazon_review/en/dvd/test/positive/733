totally worth it just the packaging alone makes this box set worthwhile . i 've never seen anything like it . the exterior is like a trapper keeper , slick plastic that 's kind of puffy and soft to the touch . it then folds out into four dvd trays and has a really well designed booklet , talking about the films and the genre ( sukeban ) . i just got my copy and everyone that 's been over and seen it has flipped out about the box , `cause it just looks so cool ( and is so pink ) . the bonus cd of reiko ike singing is mounted in with the booklet and is weird and kind of a novelty . i put it on at a party a couple of weeks ago and people were way into it . the movies are cool too . `` criminal woman : killing melody '' is my favorite , but the end of `` delinquent girl boss : worthless to confess '' is amazing . there 's no way that quentin tarintino did n't see it before he made `` kill bill '' . i just read on the website of the company that put out the set ( panik house ) that they pre-sold 2/3 of the run of 10,000 and they think they 're going to sell out soon , so if you 're at all interested in getting a copy of this you should . now . it was totally worth the money
