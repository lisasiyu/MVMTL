the demonic genius of the artist bruno nuytten 's film on the life and times of camille claudel ( isabelle adjani ) and her mentor/lover auguste rodin ( gerard depardieu . ) a well directed film that follows the female artist 's humble beginnings as rodin 's assistant and lover to her later achievements as a great sculptress and artist . the film focuses on camille 's development as a character rather than being a shallow biographical film of her work . the film explores her relationship with rodin and how his infidelities led her to feel used and abandoned . the film shows how her parting with rodin opened the doors of her creativity and talent as a sculptress in her own right . the film closely associates her genius as an artist with her mental disintegration until she is confined to a mental asylum in the later part of her life . this is a great film and both adjani and depardieu play their roles very well . the film is a careful psychological study of both artists and what inspired their talents in making such great works of art . i strongly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in art , history , or just good drama
