i had a farm in africa ... .. this is one of my all time favorite movies , not just because it is a great romance , but because it is about a woman defining her own destiny , which is a theme i love . the set design and costume design perfectly capture the feeling of early twentieth century . i hate watching 'period ' that are ruined by the costume , makeup , and set designers ' attempt to make the antique look seem modern , pride and prejudice with kiera knightley is a perfect example . this is a great movie , wonderfully told . i cry every time i watch it . recommended
