very pleasantly surprised ! we rented this movie not expecting too much . we like this genre ( moron movies ) . unlike several eggheads who reviewed this movie , we had no trouble at all following the plot . we just thought this movie was a scream ! lots of idiotic action and the girlfriend from hell . what 's not to like ? if you like this type of movie , you will love it ! mac mccaule
