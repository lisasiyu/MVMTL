the coming home from war movie . i love this movie , it is a must see for anyone who is in the military or is a military family member . it is emotionally charged with issues every military family deals with when the soldier returns from war . keep a box of tissues handy , i cry everytime i watch it . eventhough it takes place post wwii , the feelings remain the same for every generation .
