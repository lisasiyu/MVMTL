a beautiful piece of cinematographic work `` from hell '' is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography i 've ever seen in a horror movie . although the story about who jack the ripper is is a little contrived at times , in general the plot is interesting . all the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you 'd expect , considering the subject-matter . it keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours , not to mention it looks beautiful . heather graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance , showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the victorian era , and johnny depp is amazing , as usual , although ( as others have pointed out ) his english accent may be a little off , which i would n't know about since i 'm american . this film is great entertainment and i would highly recommend buying the dvd ( if you rent it you 'll more than likely end up buying it anyway , it 's that good ) . `` from hell '' makes a great addition to any movie collection .
