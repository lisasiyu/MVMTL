the office does not dissappoint ! the bbc 's version of the office is a refreshing , intelligent depiction of today 's business environment . laced with sarcasm and gags that are so astounding they defy comprehension , it is worth suspening disbelief for optimal enjoyment ! david brent 's portrayal of the idiot boss is genius . and his supporting characters - namely gareth and tim , are wonderful . after working in a corporation for many years , i could identify with many of the issues that arose and wish that i was able to respond in the ways that these characters respond . one takeaway , which i consider a serious one , is that honesty is underrated . brent repeatedly puts his foot in his mouth for the things he says and many times , it 's embarrassing to watch . but the beauty of brent is his honesty and it makes his obnoctiousness tolerable . he tells it like it his , albiet distorted , but you always know where he stands ( or is trying to stand ! ) . two thumbs way up for this box set which cleverly combined sharp wit with doses of reality . loved the ending too
