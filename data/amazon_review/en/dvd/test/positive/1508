not too serious , but definitely fun wow , the reviews here are pretty high strung , like they 're expecting this to be some kind of serious avant garde film , critiquing the early 80s , the art/fashion scene rebellion against the dullness of suburbia , sexuality , etc . i suppose you could try to load all of that into this , but i saw it as a parody that pokes fun at these types of pretention more than anything else . you get some of the atmosphere from that time , the characters and acting are pretty good , and it hangs together as scifi . there are some fun mind games in it as well , which are surprising to some viewers , but i do not want to reveal the hilarious plot twists . that is about it , no big deal , nothing all that deep . if you look at it as , well , entertainment , you can allow yourself to enjoy it for the fairly simple thing that it is . recommended . warmly
