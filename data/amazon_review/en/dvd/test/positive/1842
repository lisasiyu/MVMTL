bad education excellent spanish movie , that really reflects the consequences and attitudes of our modern catholic church , not only in one country , but in several around the world.the storyline is poignant and sometimes extremely cruel , but , is n't real life like that ? ? ? the performances are absolutely faultless and the script magnificently well adapted from the original book , the director , one of the best.but please have an open mind when you see it , and do n't try to imitate what you are about to see
