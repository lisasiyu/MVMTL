classic sci-fi movie - a must see for true sci-fi fans one of the most re-watchable sci-fi movies ever made . i can watch this move anytime , anyplace and get just as much enjoyment as the first time i saw it . very cool and clever special effects that make the planet feel very `` other-worldly . '' awesomely done cgi creatures which we see more of little by little throughout the movie . absolutely great scenes such as the creatures pulling fry down the hole , paris shooting fire with his liquor in the dark night and glimpsing the creatures hovering around him , what riddick `` sees '' with his eyes , riddick gutting one of the creatures after holding it 's arms , riddick staying in one of the creatures blind spots , and the overall cinematography and pace of the film and way the scenes cut from one to the next . the story is simple -- survival -- yet highly effective and entertaining with all the characters ' pasts and secrets and the choices they have to make throughout the film mixed in with a unique environment and threat . if you like any type of sci-fi , you should enjoy this movie . best riddick lines : `` did not know who he was * & # $ ing with . '' `` i absolutely believe in god . and i hate the # $ % ^er .
