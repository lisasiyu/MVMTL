best waste of a sunday afternoon the statement , `` he wins a couple of baseball tickets by calling a radio quiz show , '' misleads the viewer from the best part about this film . he wins cubs world series tickets ! therefore , this should be a must see for any cubs fan ! there is also a cameo by one of the cubs ' greats and , not suprisingly , he has a major impact on the film . if there is a better movie about a guy breaking out of prison to see the cubs in the world series ... i have n't seen it
