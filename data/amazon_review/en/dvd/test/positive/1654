good biopic preety decent movie based on the life of buddy holly , do n't know how much is true , there might be some exaggerations , but hey no biography is 100 % fact ... ... .what is fact is he put out a lot of catchy hits in the span of 2 years , before he got killed in a private plane crash at 22 years old that also claimed the lives of pop stars ritchie valens and j.p. `` the big bopper '' richardson in february 1959 ... ... good biopic , not sappy and stands the test of time
