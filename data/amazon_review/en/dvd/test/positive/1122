great companion to the cd if you love daryl hall & john oates , you will love this new dvd ! daryl , john & the band singing live all the songs from their latest cd our kind of soul . they are great recorded , but unbelievable performing live ! rock steady is a great up beat tune , and the sad , but beautiful neither one of us is very poignant . due to the multi layered nuances of after the dance , this will probably be the only time you will see this great , haunting song sung live by hall & oates .
