a complete reason for seeing this movie well as all my acquaintances know i 'd go to see anything angelina jolie appeared in , even if she 's in it for only two minutes . years ago pauline kael pronounced that `` by now jane fonda has become a complete reason for going to the movies '' ( probably around the time of klute ) and it 's been apparent for some time that jolie is the spiritual descendant of jane fonda . think of them , each one the wild , tormented daughter of a great matinee idol with a cleancut image . and neither one with a super great range , but both excellent at what they do : jane was terrific at denoting `` modernity '' ( to kael , she carried forth bette davis ' attitude of purring like a perfectly kept motor ) , while jolie is all about being the `` wife 's worst nightmare . '' taking lives is only about one inch deep , and the trailer tells it all , but why not see it anyhow ? either you 're in thrall to her giant lips and long arms , her downcast gaze and humungous tattoos ( here covered up for the most part ) -- or you 're not . playing ileanna scott , ace fbi profiler in serial murders , is n't much of a stretch for jolie , for nowadays all you have to do is immerse yourself in a room filled with horrid photos of the killer 's crimes and then drift into a trance state where you become the killer ; then you wake up gasping like a fish and you shout out , `` he uses toothpaste to sedate them ! '' and everyone goes on the alert for crest sales . ileanna 's pregnancy is a dilly especially watching the film in early 2006 , a time of great world strife during which no magazine cover appears without a mention of brad and angelina 's forthcoming baby . one of the few shock moments of the movie involve a threat to ileanna 's baby , too gross to go into here . i remember during the filming of this movie the paparazzi caught a tender moment between jolie , her son maddox , and her french co-star here olivier martinez , best known for dating the australian pop star kylie minogue . angelina and olivier took little maddox to his first ball game , and the next thing you knew , kylie was flying across to montreal to pay an impromptu set visit . well , i suppose angelina was innocent that time , or as innocent as she gets . she waited until mr and mrs smith to play her full ace of hearts . and olivier and kylie are still together as of this writing , hooray
