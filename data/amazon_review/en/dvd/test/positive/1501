one of the first and still best television docu-dramas ! in the fall of 1974 i gathered with others at a friends house with the intention of going out for the evening . by chance , a commercial announced that `` the missiles of october '' , one of television 's first attempts at a docu-drama ( the other being the andersonville trial ) was about to come on . we decided to wait 'a few minutes ' to see some of it . three hours later we were still in our chairs with our coats on . silence pervaded the room as the drama unfurled and there was an overwhelming sense of `` you are there '' that kept us riveted to the story . looking back now i realize that this was one of the greatest stage productions ever made on what then had been somewhat of a mystery to the average american , namely , what had actually transpired during the thirteen days of intense struggle of october of 1962 , when the world was on the edge of nuclear armageddon . this work is very intellectual , superbly written and gripping in dramatic scenes . it is important to remember that this was shown during an era of strong anti-military feeling . the country was winding down from vietnam and to see a positive resolvency of a possible global catastrophe by politicians concerning an incident in '62 from when we were only children reminded us of what america can accomplish when sane men seek safe ways out of conflict . there is a lot of good acting . the scenes are cleverly done , shifting between washington and moscow with tid-bits of b & w 'events in the world ' film thrown in . we get to see `` inside '' the exec committees of both the white house and kremlin and how they plot strategy . attempts to duplicate the success of this stage drama failed miserably . `` pueblo '' in 1976 did not capture the tension and mystique and television has simply never been able to repeat what i now believe was a dramatic miracle of production on screen . well recommended .
