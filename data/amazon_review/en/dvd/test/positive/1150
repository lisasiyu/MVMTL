'' ( 2 ) the lost years ( 8 scenes ) `` how did a poor country boy ... become such a celebrity so soon after he arrived in london ? it 's one of the great mysteries of shakespeare 's life ... ten years before shakespeare had been ... in stratford with no job and few prospects . how did he do it ? how did he make that leap ? and what did he do in those ten years ? '' ( 3 ) the duty of poets ( 8 scenes ) `` in the 1590s the english theatre entered its golden age and for the next twenty years its brightest star was william shakespeare . but back in the early 1590s , shakespeare was one of many gifted young poets . what was it that transformed him in the next few years to the greatest thing anybody had ever seen . what happened to him in his career and his private life ?
