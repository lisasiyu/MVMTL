the best of many victor hugo 's novel has been filmed so many times , with excellent actors donning the hump : lon chaney , anthony quinn , and anthony hopkins are a few examples that spring to mind . however , the crude 'animalistic ' behaviour and the pathos that charles laughton brings to his performance is wonderful , for at no time can the audience feel any sentiment for this quasimodo . he is a horror with a human soul . while cedric hardwicke is a horror that pretends to have a soul . it is very easy to enthuse and celebrate the film , simply because it is wonderful to watch for its sets and , therefore , its art direction , photography , and design . the reason it was not heaped with oscars is simple : it is one of the 'great films ' of 1939 . let us go back to the actors . cedric hardwicke has never been as smooth a villain , he is as frollo is evil . maureen o'hara in her first film may not be the ideal for a gypsy maid , but she does show what would become her strengths : independence from , and yet a dependence for men ... edmond o'brien as pierre shows his great talent ( probably one of the best screen actors ever , he played a different person in each role , you could not type cast him ) . thomas mitchell as the king of thieves is smart and in this film extremely dangerous . another thing that the production did with understated talent was show a europe moving from medieval to renassiance existence . if there is a fault with this film : it is simple . it has a happy ending .
