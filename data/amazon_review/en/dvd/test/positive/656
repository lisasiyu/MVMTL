please stop the crying already : - ( ... ... ... i really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc . i have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length . the movie is about a giant gorilla ! it is a fantasy film kids ! the original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well . i think the remake is incredible ... ..is it better than the original ? in some ways yes ! in some ways no ! thats the way it goes ! i still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone 's movie collection ! i wish peter jackson would try to remake son of kong into as good a movie ... ..now if he can pull that off ... ... . ; - )
