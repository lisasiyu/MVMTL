it is still fun ! ! even after all the years , the show is entertaining -- not rocket science stuff but just plain fun & entertaining . the cast stay to character show to show ( & season to season ) . while the plots are n't complicated , they allow the viewer to escape for about 25 minutes into enjoyment , & knowing that the good guys will triumph & live to fight another day
