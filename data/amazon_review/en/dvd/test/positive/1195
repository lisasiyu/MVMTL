i think it was a hoot upon seeing this film in the theatre espeically the part where candice bergen tries to woo burt back with her terrible singing `` better than ever '' i think that is the name of the song ..as always jill clayburgh was winning as ever and burt could n't been better too . its a shame jill 's middle age romance flick with jeffrey tambor .. `` never again '' got the due it deserved when ti came out . everybody should check that out , its a hoot too
