a compelling performance having been a fan of rigoletto for many years , i ordered this dvd based mostly on placido domingo 's participation . having watched it now , i have found it to be a rewarding performance . domingo 's duke is very gratifying . macneil 's rigoletto is vocally weaker , but his stage presence is powerful . on the whole his performance is effective as rigoletto . i 'm glad to have the dvd and expect to enjoy it many times
