almost solid gold to begin with , i wish these so-called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol ! that said , this is a rare case ( the 1st of its kind ? ) of a movie being better than the play it was based on . the general framework was of course the same , but in the play judy holliday 's part was taken by josephine hull , a very funny little old lady ( who also scored both on bway and on the screen in `` harvey '' and `` arsenic and old lace , '' to name the only 2 that i know of ) , and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges , it blossomed in the film . one problem , there simply were no witty lines , either in the play or the movie . this is odd for kaufman ( though the play was produced in 1953 , very late in his career ) , but about par for burrows ( early in his career ) . but still it was clever and interesting , the play had more structure than the movie ( typical of kaufman ) , but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play , which surprised me very much and made me wonder about kaufman . also the flick left out all the naughty words which i 'm sure hull barked out with delicious abandon ! ( note : kaufman co-wrote the play , burrows adapted it for the screen . ) this i think was more a sit-com than an actually witty kaufman comedy . and finally , judy holliday did not play a `` dumb blonde '' ! she only did that in `` born yesterday .
