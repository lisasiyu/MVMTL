i love the o.c . at first : when i bought the first season of the oc i did not know it . but then i watched the first episode and i loved it . all the characters play so realistic . each episode is different . sometimes it 's funny but is also often serious . after i watched all episodes i felt really sad , because i wanted to know how it goes on . but know the second season is out so i have more than 40 hours oc to watch . of course there are extras in the box like interviews and something like that . and the quality of the discs is also great . i have never bought better dvds than this . the oc is the best you can buy on dvd . and one of the best points is the very great price because you get almost 20 hours .
