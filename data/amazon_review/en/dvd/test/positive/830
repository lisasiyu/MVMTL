the alternative would 've been to make more of the same . a lot of fans of series 1 through 6 would say series 7 & 8 are a travesty , or that they are a letdown . i suppose that would make me one of the solitary voices of opposition . the way i see it , 7 & 8 are simply the natural progression of the show . even around series 6 , i 've noticed that the same tired old jokes were being run into the ground , particularly in regards to cat 's nose/sniff gags , one-liners about dead fashions , and kryten 's sudden and unexplainable lapses back into his inability to call rimmer a `` smeghead '' ( smeeee-heeee ! ) . i do n't know how the diehard fans abide it , but for me , it got a little old . starting with series 7 , there 's a bit more drama involved , and not such a disregard for the lack of continuity . the cliffhanger at the end of series 8 leaves you wanting , but as it 's now approaching 10 years since , i would n't hold out hopes for another series . do n't be surprised if that 's all , folks
