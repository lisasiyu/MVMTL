quite possibly the best ppv ever put on when i heard that ecw was coming back full-blown and in its entirety i knew i had to review the best ecw show ever put on , and without a doubt one of the best ppv 's put on under wwe 's name lance storm vs. chris jericho - one of the best openers i have ever seen , these two just mesh so well , and that 's mader completely obvious when you watch this the two dropkick spots are great but the ending makes you feel like you 've been cheated 8/10 super crazy vs. little guido vs. tajiri - excellent way to follow up the opener there are spots galore in this m atch with the top one obviously being crazy 's balcony moonsault this match has a lot of run-in 's but that does n't hurt it that much 7/10 psicosis vs. rey mysterio - i 'm kind of in the middle on this match , as its nowhere near as good as some of the stuff they have put on before it is still a solid bout with a great legdrop spot rey picks it up with the help of the 619 ( boo ) 6/10 sabu vs. rhyno - this starts right after rvd 's heart-felt promo , this was a little bit of a let-down although sabu ca n't be expected to do everything anymore , kinda feels slow and dragged-on even though it is only 7 minutes and that 's never good , great finish 5/10 eddie guerrerro vs. chris benoit - technical masterpiece , with both men using great ring psychology , only complaint is that just when it kicks into high gear it ends but that 's one complaint over one great match 8/10 tanaka vs. mike awesome - wow , is the only word that comes to mind when viewing this match , that and ouch , it is just a spot-fest but what a brilliant spot-fest it is where the action never lets up for a second , withouty a doubt motn 10/10 dudleyz vs. sandman & tommy dreamer - this had to be on the card , although it is not my cup of tea , it is still a very good match , the teaming of sandy and dreamer works like a charm and creates some funny moments 6/10 all this action is capped off by the trashing of eric bischoff , so i do not know how it could have gotten any better , great climax to a great nigh
