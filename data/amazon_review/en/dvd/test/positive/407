footloosin ' good time ! i do n't think that in real life a pastor can actually outlaw dancing in a town but it makes a decent story . great highlights in the film are when kevin bacon taught chris penn 's character how to dance ( lets hear it for the boy ! ) , the fight scene when bacon and penn beat up the corny tough guys , and of course the great dancing during the prom which closed the film
