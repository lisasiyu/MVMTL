a marvelous blend of the `` old '' and the `` new '' besides painting a satisfying portrait of `` upwardly mobile profesional black americans , '' `` boomerang '' is an appealing look at the oft-times amusing and tumultuous struggle between the sexes . eddie murphy , who served as producer , is wonderful as the `` player '' who gets his comeupance from a female equal , in the well-proportioned form of robin givens . a stellar cast that features legends eartha kitt and geoffrey holder , then up-and-comers chris rock , martin lawrence , and a pre-oscar halle berry , established performers like lela rochon , tisha campbell , and david allen grier , and an over-the-top grace jones makes this a classic in the truest sense of the term . watch the film with director reginald hudlin 's commentary . he provides colorful insight into the pivotal use of new york locations , costuming , casting concerns , the importance of background music , film economics , and unintentional social commentary . many times the director 's `` chat '' is dull ; that can not be said for the words of this talented young man . `` boomerang , '' like the word implies , is a film that warrants `` return '' visits .
