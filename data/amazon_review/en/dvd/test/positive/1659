great drama for trekkies and non-believers alike like the recent revival of the ford thunderbird , the enterprise season 3 dvd set is overpriced although the product within is beautiful . the video quality is fine , sound is rich , and the extras are good , but at least as much love and care were lavished on other series , like freaks and geeks , without the high price . ( through a series of fortunate events , i got my copy at a discount . ) i do n't consider myself a big star trek fan . most of the shows set in the trek universe work so hard to be `` star trek '' that much of the life is gone from them . my immediate attraction to enterprise came because it was a bit less formulaic than the other shows -- for example , `` comic relief '' is blissfully absent here . the goofy humor of star trek : the next generation never appealed to me . fox mulder 's dry wise cracking on the x files ? funny stuff ! commander data trying to be sherlock holmes ? not so much . season 2 of this series found an unusually natural and convincing cast awash in a sea of weak dialog and worn-out stories . ( wow , there are aliens trying to destroy the enterprise with a time bomb ! oh , it was only a dream . ) threatened with tv extinction , brannon braga and rick berman ( who wrote many of season 2 's episodes themselves ) brought in several important new writers and loosened the reins on the aging trek formula . all kinds of interesting ideas were unleashed and explored , characters gained dimension , and aspects of the difficult world we face here in the 21st century were reflected in enterprise 's 22nd . in season 3 we have a series that offers the excitement of the best space opera ( wowie zowie phasers , stunts , and great production design ) and the ideas of real speculative fiction ( cloning , dimensional shifts , and temporal manipulation ) . ruminations on loneliness , loss , and sexuality bring human drama to a genre that often settles for melodrama . ( curiously , religion is absent . ) at the same time , archer and his crew are dealing with the kind of stress and moral dilemmas that make the best episodes of er so compelling . few big-budget action movies pack as much interest and emotion as `` star trek : enterprise -- the complete third season .
