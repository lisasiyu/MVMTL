powerfully cool high budget old school action-packed anime ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! a cool fantasy action that will blow you away ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! maybe not fast as dragon ball but is soo high budget ! ! ! i mean ... the animation is superb ***** ( the moves , destruction and fights were very realistic ) , the character desing is soo colorful ( just as seen in the cover ) , the graphics are pretty realistic , good story but very simple , bad english dub but not that bad , cool song at the ending credits and the camera moves were awesome ! ! i said that this anime is like dragon ball because there are to many `` hadukens '' , jumps that make look like the characters are flying and the story about the bad guy that want the ultimate power to conquer the wolrd but the good guys also can have the ulmate power to protect the world . but this anime is not that similar to dragon ball . i like the concept of the characters ... i mean ... each character have a diferent power , one with a cool spirit sword , other with a power whip , other with `` haduken '' and the last one with the control of a giant power dragon ! ! ! obiously this anime concentrate more on the action and not much with the story . i never saw the serie , so i do n't care what people say about the comparison to the serie . p.s : this anime is like pg-13 style or a saturday morning cartoon but do n't worry ! ! you will be sooo entertained that you wo n't care . adios .
