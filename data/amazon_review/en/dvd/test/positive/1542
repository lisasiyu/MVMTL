i 'd give it 100 stars if i could ! this film brought me to tears . nights of cabiria is the first film i 've seen from this brilliant italien director . cabiria is such an enduring character that will always be remembered for her innocence , spunk , and most importantly , her defiant spirit after going through so much humiliation by scumbags who took advantage of her golden heart . highly recommended to everyone .
