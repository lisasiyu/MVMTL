two good flicks a previous reviewer trashed pi , why i can not comprehend , its blend of schizoid paranoia and underground religious themes leads to an engrossing and disturbing film , well worth seeing by anyone with an interest in philosophy , psychological study , and religion . some of the acting is weak , but then again it was a low budget film so one must forgive that aspect of it . however the direction more than makes up for it ... ... ... .ps his new movie requim for a dream is also a must see ... .
