this documentary was a bit weak 9-11 was meticulously planned out by our government . if people do not believe me , go read and study that day like it was your babay and you 'll find the truth . i was a bit skeptical at first as well . now my eyes are open to the totalitarian states that we live in . this is n't the united states of america , this is the beginning of a new world order . do n't believe me , we 'll probably never know , because we 'll be spoonfed our news on the war in iraq by the corporate media that controls and censors what we see and do n't see ! do n't think so ? you , along with millions of other ignorant idiots who choose to follow the war in iraq by watching cnn ( censored news network ) , or fauxnews . it pains me that people still do n't realize that there is no fight for democracy in iraq . its a fight for imperial ambitions , we need iraq for oil , and to set up a puppet government so it does n't scare israel , our ultra conservative evangelical christian politicians can sleep better knowing their holy land is out of the hands of `` radical muslim fundamentalists . '' no one will know until people actually open up a damn book and read for yourself , instead of relying on `` experts '' who `` know '' what is going on . i thought we were intelligent people , us americans ? most of you ca n't even figure out wat the problem really is . its our corrupt government
