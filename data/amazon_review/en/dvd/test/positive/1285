a must-buy for animations lovers ! bought this hd dvd without having seen the film previously , so it was a risk ... .and i won ! i absolutely enjoyed it from begining to end . this film is very under-rated . it 's witty , well done and clever ... unlike all these stupid animal films that are out now . buy this film even if you have n't seen it ... .you wo n't regret it
