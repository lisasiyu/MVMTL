brat pack i just have to ask how the other reviews can comment on how sloppy the package is when it is n't even released yet . they have n't seen it ? the package is very cool , it is a notebook 3 ring binder with 3 protective sleeves for the discs and 1 for the music cd . this is a great package for those who grew up with the brat pack era . i know what the packaging looks like because i work for the company who made them
