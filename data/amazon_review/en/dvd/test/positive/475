it 's about time ! finally , in this day of pc pablum , someone tells the real history of the confederate soldier ! you 'll learn little-known facts about the major players , including general lee of course , but more importantly , this set focuses heavily on the average man in the ranks and why he chose to fight . daily camp life gets attention as well as what the soldier wore and what equipment he used . the real reasons and motivations for fighting are explored and what life was like after the war when men had to go home in defeat to often-devastated homes . highly recommend ! it 's a must for serious students of the war and anyone who wants an authentic look at the period
