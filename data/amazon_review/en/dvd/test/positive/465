robben ford in europe , again ! well i am very surprized , frankly , that no one has reviewed this superb musical experience yet , so i will ! this dvd was released in may 2005 and is the first real taste of robben ford live since his excellent live set in baden-baden germany in the 1990s as part of the `` ohne filter-musik pur '' series-and they are all great ! in this paris set in 2001 robben has his best band yet- with a great drummer , super bassist ( check his solo in `` help the poor '' ) and , for the first time , keyboards . i ca n't praise this performance enough . robben exhibits his style masterfully , without a lot of show , and demonstrates how he has successfully combined jazz ( especially jazz sax ) with chicago electric blues . ford started around the bay area in the 1960s and built up a large following with the `` charles ford band '' ( named for his dad ) during the end of the blues power revival of the 1ate 1960s . he got to play with charlie mussellwhite and then miles davis which really extended his blues-jazz style and chops . i love the part in the interview ( a great bonus feature ! ) where he said miles liked him when he played his own stuff , his own way ... not what miles had originally thought he 'd play . well this dvd is well produced , has a good lenght and track selection and the sound is excellent , as you would expect from the inaukstik people ! the opening track `` prison of love '' one of fords strongest numbers is magnificent and sets the stage for the rest of the performance . it 's a cool jazz-blues . the top selection of the dvd is `` help the poor '' from his most famous and acclaimed recording `` talk to your daughter '' . this version is great the the solos are as good as you 'll ever hear from anyone ! i always thought this and `` born under a bad sign '' were ford 's greatest songs ever ! `` chevrolet '' is a remake of a donovan song `` hey gyp '' ( ford is a master of re-doing old tunes , especially blues , in a new groove and extending them ! ) this song was done by the animals as well in the late 1960s . it is great ! `` start it up '' is a ford rock staple with his trusty 1960s telecaster , which he plays through most of this set-that 's also unusual . his version of mike mcdonald 's `` nothing to nobody '' is outstanding with its great jazz chord structure . the minor key blues offering `` moonchild blues '' is perhaps the second greatest tune on the dvd , it sounds very close to the howlin ' wolf classic `` who 's been talking '' ! you just want to keep on playing it ! i highly recommend this dvd . it is the best new blues inspired dvd of 2005 and a great addition to anyone 's collection . if you only get one robben ford dvd , this is it ! great product and interesting bonus interview
