25 words or less engaging characters , interesting plots , decent writing/translating , fabulous animation , great music ( opening song is in russian , english , and latin ) . and tachikomas ! there ! 20 words ! you do n't have to be a fanatic ( or `` otaku '' as we otaku like to say ) about this stuff to like it . a word about the tachikomas : they are tank robots the size of a vw bug and designed like spiders , and they are definately with the `` good guys '' . they can even shoot `` silk '' and cling to the sides of buildings . and they sound ( and frequently act ) like children . you would never think of saying a robot that looks like a spider was *cute* , but the tachis 'll win you over
