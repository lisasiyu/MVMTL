they 're not just getting rich ... they 're getting even . eddie murphy and dan aykroyd star in this great 80 's comedy flick that never gets old , i seriously have seen this film so many times and each time it gets funnier with each viewing especially with the little things that you tend to miss during the first time . the scene where louise ( dan aykroyd ) wakes up in his own bed in the following morning after a terrible experience and tells his buttler in a very snoby accent that he had this awful nightmare where this negro ... and then he sees eddie murphy 's character next to him smilling had me bursting with tears of laughter , the comedic timing in this film was perfect i highly recomend this film .
