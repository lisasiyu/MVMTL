five stars are not enough having read through most of the other reviews of this excellent series , i find there is little new praise to add . we stumbled upon this series when it aired on masterpiece theatre one evening and have been hooked ever since . kitchen conveys volumes about his character 's inner turmoil and thoughts -- without speaking a single word . by watching the delightful interplay between foyle and sam , between father and son , between employer and subordinate , friend and friend , you discover nuggets of each person 's upbringings , beliefs , losses , and fears . the mostly-unseen character who influences them all , the soon-to-invade german army , continuously forces each character to internally re-examine his or her priorities and decisions . this series is superb . anyone interested in mysteries or in history will thoroughly enjoy .
