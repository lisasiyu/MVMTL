`` can anyone play ? '' first off i agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie . when denise richards sees matt dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like , `` is this just a game for the boys , or can anyone play ? '' she looks so sweet and hot that it 's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later . however she pulls ift off pretty well . in fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well . i could n't understand why kevin bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual , but that was actually pretty good acting ... .i ca n't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists , but it 's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing . i give it 5 stars because it 's both fun and funny , and of course very hot at times . well worth a look ...
