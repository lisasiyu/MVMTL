civil war great movie , great actors for such a sad part of the u.s. history ! it is great to see in this movie some men who really existed ( especially `` stonewall '' jackson ) . we do n't know if the personalities showed into the movie were really like this or if it is a pure fiction , but at the end of the day it 's not very important , because the historical interest is preserved
