a fabulous the nutcracker production i hate ballet . it is so boring , and i start craving dialogue after about twenty minutes . all that dancing gets so monotonous ! so it was startling to watch emilio ardolino 's film version of george balanchine 's the nutcracker ( 1993 ) on videocassette and just adore it . the sets and costumes , by rouben ter-arutunian , use color to perfection . the tschaikovsky music is glorious . and the dancing , by the new york ballet , is outstanding . i could even follow the story with just susan cooper 's minimal narrative read by kevin kline . it is a great ensemble cast , and macauley culkin fits in nicely as the nutcracker prince . bart robinson cook as godfather drosselmeier is magnificent , and newcomer jessica lynn cohen is enchanting as marie . i clearly do n't have a lot of experience in stage nutcracker 's , or any live ballet . a nutcracker expert may pan it for something . leonard maltin asininely called it `` much too stagey '' ! leonard , they call it filmed ballet ! of course , it is stagey ! and this 1993 production is as good as ballet gets for me . as someone at newsweek says on the front of the videocassette box , this is `` like having the best seats anyone ever had for the nutcracker . '' it is an enthralling plum pudding of a christmas present for viewers of all ages , especially dance lovers .
