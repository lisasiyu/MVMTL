phenomenal the acting is superb and the dedication to recreating the era is phenomenal . i loved the music even more after i saw the 3rd `` extras '' dvd and found out about all what went into making it authentic . and , finally actors who look like the jewish people of the times ! henry ian cusick is simply amazing and real and heartfelt as jesus . i 've never seen a better rendition . the main pharisee was excellent as well . if you did n't know this movie was a word for word portrayal of the bible you would n't think anything was strange about it . it simply comes off as a world class major motion picture . and then after you do know , you are so glad that they did it that way . i do have to disagree with one point of a reviewer that it `` made no apologies '' in portraying that the romans and the jews put jesus to death . i thought it was quite clear that god the father sent him to the cross and jesus accepted that role . the romans and the jews were simply instruments of god and that comes across loud and clear . i ca n't recommend this movie enough . you will get a lot out of it each time you watch it and you will watch it over and over . the interviews on the `` behind the scenes '' with the scholars and actors , etc . was excellent . make sure you get the 3 cd set to see all the extras
