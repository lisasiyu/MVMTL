the movie that started the modern american mafia genera the godfather set the american mafia movie genera . a good plot line with a tight scrip , superb direction and well acted . there are many murders , after all this is about gangsters but why it 's rated `` r '' is beyond me . it 's way less gruesome with less disturbing violence than casino and many modern ma films are much more violent . the power plays , honour and business scheming between the mafia families give the framework of the film with personal trial and tribulations providing more depth for the character development that echo throughout the genera ever since and make the godfather repeatedly watchable . i wanted a copy for a present and after spending months looking for a copy in the retail shops without success , i found this widescreen version at a great price on amazon within seconds and , i ended up keeping it .
