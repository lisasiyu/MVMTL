great soundtrack public enemy 's soundtrack to spike lee 's he got game is some great music . public enemy 's return after disappearing for a few years is a spellbinding concept album about the sport industry . krs one and the wu tang clan 's masta killa make guest raps on this album . this also has another great collaboration on it . on the title track the loop sample of buffalo springfield continues through and the stephen stills starts to sing the song at the end with flava flav introducing him . favorites include resurrection ft. masta killa , he got game ft. stephen stills , unstoppable ft. krs one , revelation 33 1/3 revolutions , politics of the sneaker pimps , what you need is jesus , and go cat go . recommende
