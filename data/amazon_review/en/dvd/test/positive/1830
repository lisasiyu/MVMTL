its sad that the hell raiser debut and hellbound were the only great hell raisers . for kirsty cotton ( ashley laurence ) , the nightmares never end . still fresh in her fevered memory of her father 's skinned corpse , the evil machinations of her uncle frank 's reanimated body and the unspeakable perversity of the cenobites . but the worst is yet to come . from beyond the outer darkness , from the darkest regions of the imagination comes hellbound : hellraiser ii . do n't bother with the other hell raisers their just plain crap & boring
