favorite film eighteen years ago we left california 's central coast to live in wisconsin where we 've endured many a frozen winter evening with a bowl of popcorn and a movie or two . of the many movies this means we 've seen , i 'd have to say the lady vanishes ranks as pretty much my all time favorite . i love the tension of the plot against the innocence of the time . this is a time we do n't well know today - a time of gentle courtesy and concern for others ; wrongness of bad things happening is simply obvious . this slice of a different day shows us life before electronic entertainment - the vaudvillian dancing , the whistling , the intricacies of human interaction and friendship - the respect shown automatically by the lady and her friends for each person . this is also before actors needed to be 'flawless ' and shallow . cruel enemies - both nationally and personally - slash this quiet , peace filled world . there is something valuable and instructive in this window to the past . a bit of accidental history that portrays wholesome times under international threat and prevailing open human goodness . it may be an odd reason to like a film so much , but there it is . this great plot , action , tension against the backdrop of a kinder and very real day , provide the kind of cultural fresh air that can give both perspective and direction
