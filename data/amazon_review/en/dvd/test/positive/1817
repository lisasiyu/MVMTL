great season , great tv show , classic ! i just finished watching the dvd . i was in college when the show first came out so i watched it sporadically and missed a lot . the second season is better than the second and really solidifys the show as a classic . the writing gets even better , as does the acting and the story lines . i slowly became more absorbed in the show and am dying for the third season to be released . i see that it was supposed to be released already and hope it will be soon .
