in the beginning ... holy cow , these 10-minute animated shorts are awesome ! the funnest part in watching them is to see superman , clark kent , lois lane and the whole gang in their originality . the stories are basic but smart , quick-paced , exciting , and heroic . yeah , the soundtracks are a bit over-the top at times , but that was the music style of adventure movies in the 1940s . i love the spirited characterizations and some of the stories like with the volcano , the runaway train robbery , etc . i also noticed how the recent donner and singer films have borrowed from these . especially in `` superman returns '' , his flying style of dropping out of the sky feet-first was originally done in these animations -- cool ! a must for superman fans .
