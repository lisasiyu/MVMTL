great , but i missed subtitles in spanish i loved all three chapters of this dvd , as well as poirot set 2 . the menu is easy to use , the quality of the picture is incredible , etc . the only thing i missed , where the subtitles in spanish . i speak fluently english , so that was not a problem . so , if you are going to buy this dvd and dont know english , dont buy it , unless you want to learn . and the sound is a little soft , so dont forget to turn the volume down when the dvd is over ... hope this was helpful , and have a great day
