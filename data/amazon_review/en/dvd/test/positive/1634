party line dances dvd this was a great video . in the past , i had bought some videos from other sources and also checked a bunch out from the library and most were not very good . they were out of date or did not have the kind of dancing we do around here . but shawn 's dance dvd was very up to date . it has the type of dancing that we often do in my location ( florida ) and at the lds church dances i attend .
