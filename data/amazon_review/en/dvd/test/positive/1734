for love is as strong as death a young couple , very much in love , stop off at a tavern in a small 19th century german village . a gaunt , grim faced stranger joins them . just recently the stranger had purchased a 99-year lease on a tract of land adjoining the village 's cemetery . the stranger had built an impregnable , `without door or gate ' , wall about the estate . the stranger , of course , is death , and within the walls of his `garden ' reside the souls of the newly dead and the innumerable candles whose flames melt the tallow of all human life . death attends the young man he is about to claim . the woman leaves the room for a moment , and when she returns the stranger and her beloved are gone . the woman gives chases , sees the shade of her beloved pass through the impassable wall to death 's garden . an old apothecary finds the distraught woman and shelters her in his pharmacy . the woman drinks a potion from an ancient bottle and is again in front of the walled garden - although now there is a door opening to a steep staircase . the woman enters and meets death of the staircases . i want to go where my beloved is , the woman tells him . death strikes a bargain - if the woman can save the life of just one of three whose candle has grown short , he will return her fiancé to her . i liked fritz lang 's destiny ( der müde tod ) a lot . death 's bargain plunges the movie into three episodes , as the actors playing the loving couple and death reenact endangered love stories in arab , italian and chinese settings . lang employs primitive , and effective , tricks - camera angles , double exposures , etc . - to show the dead filing past the living , to make carpets fly and to transform pagoda into elephants . underpinning it all is the fascinating struggle between death and love . it 's lang 's meditation on this struggle that i enjoyed the most . after that poignant scene on the staircase i was hooked on the woman 's quest for reunion . the musical underscore is appropriate , tasteful and unobtrusive . the print is in good condition , watchable with flares and scratches . although this disk is a little pricey , it contains no extras of any kind .
