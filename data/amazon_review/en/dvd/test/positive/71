good idea , altered for artistic purposes this is a great `` feel good '' movie , but hollywood altered the story for theatricality . in the film , a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up , in one year , to become calculus winners . there is a good backgroud article at : http : //reason.com/0207/fe.jj.stand.shtml that describes how the process took ten years , so that the original group of future-burger-flipping students were not the ones who passed the ap calculus exam . jaime escalante ( played by edward james olmos of `` miami vice '' fame ) actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time , reaching back to the junior high school that fed garfield high . the way that the movie was done , however , allows the viewers to see some of the decision-making processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them , especially their parents . remarkably , at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under escalante 's leadership . that 's 400 fewer future employees for kfc and macdonald 's . ( as escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student , `` so tough guys do n't do math - tough guys deep fry chicken for a living ? '' ) eventually , it appears that the education establishment won out , driving the brilliant teacher out , and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future . the idea is great , that no student should be regarded as hopeless , and that all should be encouraged to try , but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows .
