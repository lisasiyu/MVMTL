cheeseburgers not out of reach for action 'legend' whoa . seagal has just gone off in the last few years . after getting back to theaters with exit wounds in 2001 , he made the appalling half past dead , and has now settled into his straight-to-dvd throne . the guy must be making some serious change from these movies . he 's banged out around three flicks a year since 2003 , all so dedicated to the new formula that i can only applaud him . seriously . he just plays seagal , and he 's always an ex-secret agent , or something or other , he has the long coat to hide his wide-load body , and he whispers his words , getting dubbed in the process sometimes ( ! ) , and tries to underscore his films with a positive message about the environment , or life , or wisdom . i mean , the man was proclaimed as the reincarnation of a buddhist lama not long ago , which apparently does not conflict with his doing one cheap action flick after another for a few million . oh , and he has a band and plays blues and tours and appears in guitar magazines . what a renaissance man . i do n't remember the plot or story to this one , i only saw the last 15 minutes . suffice to say there are more exotic locales , another asian director , excessive use of seagal 's army of stuntmen , more shameless seagal mythology , more fat seagal in long leather coats . and yet , he is probably making more money than ever by now . after that mountain dew commercial , because we all know mountain dew is the preferred elixir of lamas everywhere , he is raking it in with these little gems . they either have a ) an asian director , b ) a rapper turned actor ( dmx , ja rule , treach , etc ) , or c ) both . the hairline retreating from his ever-expanding face , the acting still , er , bad , the action still incoherent due to editing that masks the fact that seagal ca n't do any stunts ( except for the one where he finishes off an ihop grand slam breakfast in seconds ) , you know what you 're going to get . idiotic 'entertainment ' and a damn good laugh , even a cry for how far the large man has fallen . no doubt this and two or three other flicks will be packaged together as a morbid dvd special
