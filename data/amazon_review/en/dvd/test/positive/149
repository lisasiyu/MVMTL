nice blend i enjoyed this workout . i love yoga for its awakening of the muscles and concentrated breathing , but it was my first experience with pilates . i enjoyed the mix because it gave my abs and biceps a workout , you get to reward your muscles w/nice stretches , and the 40 minutes went by quickly . i feel the pilates and yoga were blended well in this workout - great for beginner in either
