wow . how to get busted in a totalitarian regime : make a film like firemen 's ball . just watched that last night . amazed . brilliant transfer . may not be as poignant as loves of a blonde or his later works , but a rousing critique of the regime with some really funny scenes . but , again , that transfer amazed me . hard to believe it 's a 35 year old czech film . highly recommended . enjoyed forman 's comments on the film and the debacle that ensued . he was almost locked up for 10 years and was luckily helped out by none other than francois truffaut ! beautiful
