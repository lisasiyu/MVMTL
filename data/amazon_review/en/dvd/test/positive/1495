very good dark jackie movie . seriously , he is in a dark movie ! wow did this one catch me by surprise . i thought for sure i was getting another goofy jackie movie . not even close ! the movie starts out with jackie as a drunken cop . after showing him in some disgusting drunken moments , we get to see why he became like this . there is a group of kids going around terrorizing the police . they will do a standard bank job or something like that and then wait for the cops . having serious firepower , skills that will relate to the x games later in the movie , and already being rich , the cops certainly have theri hands full . so the cops have serious problems and they finally get jackie in a deadly game of 'can you do this to keep your fellow officers alive ' ? needless to say he does n't and becomes a drunk . when the band of x-games teens are causing trouble again a young cop tries to get jackie to help out . i know you have probably heard this type fo a cop story before but this movie is seriously one of the best looking movies i have seen in a while . all of the locations and buidings they are in are great to look at . if you have seen jackie chan 's who am i ? , rumble in the bronx , or even the well done first strike , then get ready for a change . new police story has very high production values and it is not cheesy . might not be what you are used to in a jackie movie , but it was a very nice change to see this . the movie gets between a 3.5 and a 4 but could have gotten a 5 . rongguang yu ( the iron monkey ) is in this movie and him and jackie do not fight . that dissapointed me just a bit , but they still had some really good scenes together . the special features are pretty good with behind the scenes , behind the dubbing of jackie doing his voiceover and a commentary for 2 scenes . also the picture is widscreened but the picture quality needs to be commented on . it seemed like i was watching a high definition tv . very nice
