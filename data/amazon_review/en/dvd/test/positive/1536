a great help wow what a great dvd ! i liked the show segmets the best and it was a big help planing our vacation , i never knew that there was so much to do in las vegas now . i thought the program flowed well and had a really good chaper index to quickly review the parts we wanted to see again . this looked just like someting you would see on the travel channel
