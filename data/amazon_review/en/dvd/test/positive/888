a pilates routine to grow and lean with.. i 've taken live pilates lessons in class and one-on-one setting . due to cost/transportation restraints , i wanted to keep up the progress i was seeing in my abs/core ( that no length or amount of sustained crunches ever gave me ) . i tried many and learned from many instructors via dvd , but once i got to hilary 's dvd-i realized i found the 'one ' who could both instruct and inspire most like a live instruction setting . her method is not commercialized , but personalized in its relaxed setting yet still true to the philosophy of joseph pilates without being too highbrow for a groggy early morning or weary late evening . in 30 minutes , you will cover a number of the standard pilates movements without losing focus on quality of movement over quantity . she 's very easy to spend time with . at the end of the workout , i 'm lightly sweating , stretched out , abs worked and feeling very feminine and strong.. get it . i hope you make the same and more progress than i have
