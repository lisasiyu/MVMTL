dull romance capped by effective suspense . like many hitchcock films , the first half of notorious is more romance than suspense , but the second half pure noir . cary grant recruits ingrid bergman , daughter of a former nazi spy , to spy for his agency . they apparently fall in love before ever starting an assignment . grant and bergman were two of the most attractive people of the 20th century , but for me , unfortunately together they almost bored me . i guess the chemistry just was n't there ; that 's my opinion , maybe you 'll disagree . however the suspenseful part of the plot picks up when he assigns her to spy on claude rains ( the invisible man , lawrence of arabia ) . the best way she can find to get close to rains , who knew her father , is to let him romance her , eventually resulting in a marriage proposal . some of the most suspenseful sequences of any hitchcock film occur as she 's trying to get information from rains , exploring his big mansion in south america . the suspense builds to a satisfying climax , making notorious at least a 4-star movie , perhaps one of hitchcock 's top five , but not as good as north by northwest or the man who knew too much
