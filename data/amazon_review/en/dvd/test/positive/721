busy doing nothing a drifter named trinity ( terence hill ) slides into a dusty frontier town where he discovers his outlaw brother bambino ( bud spencer ) is sheriff . disguised as sheriff , that is . bambino wants to rustle a herd of valuable horses ; trinity is enamored of a pair of comely mormon lasses . there 's more to they call me trinity than that , of course , but not a lot more . the mormons want to settle in a nearby valley and build a community . an unscrupulous land-baron ( farley granger ) wants to intimidate them out . there 's a band of mexican banditos swooping down every so often to test the resolve of the peace loving settlers . the draw of this one , though , is the quiet comedy and the interplay between hill and spencer . hill 's trinity is lithe and tanned , bambino is bearded and hulking - they 've got a little joe & hoss thing going . impossibly quick on the draw and dominating in all of the film 's many fights , trinity is about as laid-back a spaghetti western hero as you 're going to find . heck , he rides in to and out of the movie barefoot and asleep on a makeshift stretcher dragged by his horse , holstered gun trailing in the dust . hollywood ( and italia ) was cranking out counter-culture rebels with droning regularity back in the late sixties/early seventies , most with `off the man ' `tudes and ten-pound chips on their shoulders . what 's refreshing about trinity is that about the only thing he 's rebelling against is physical exertion and grown-up responsibility . bambino may be a crook , but he 's agreeably grumpy and , besides , those horses he wants to rustle belong to the evil major . they call me trinity is usually called a comedy-western , but its humor provokes smiles rather than belly laughs . it 's a good , fun , unchallenging way to spend an hour and a half . unfortunately , the direct source video version is pretty hard on the eyes . it 's presented in full-screen , edited down from its 2.35:1 aspect ration . worst of all the picture looks like it was duped off a bad video tape - indistinct images , faded colors , etc . this one is n't a classic , but it 's one of the better spaghetti westerns , and deserves a better presentation than it gets here .
