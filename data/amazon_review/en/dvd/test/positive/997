brilliant cast -- - with one exception this was a brilliant show on stage ( i saw the london cast performance ) and the dvd reflects the outstanding performances of this case in these unforgettable and inimitable dances . there is one exceptuion , who for me very nearly ruins the whole show -- - ben vereen . the show seems to have been engineered to enable him to show off , and his limited dancing and singing skills , combined with monumentally smug demeanour , reduces the efectiveness of the stellar cast . the stage show i saw was so much better for not having him in it . he is one of these talents who seem unacoutnably sucessful and popular in the usa , and for many of us in the rest of the work , his charms are invisible .
