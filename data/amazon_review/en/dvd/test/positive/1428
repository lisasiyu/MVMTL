great shavian comedy george bernard shaw wrote the screenplay based on his own very successful stage play of 1913 , and he even took an academy award for it - and deservedly so . it 's a crackerjack production , his best on screen . leslie howard plays the overbearing professor higgins and wendy hiller is the cockney flower girl transformed into a `` lady . '' both are perfect , and the whole thing is a lot better than the musical it became ( my fair lady ) . it sparkles throughout , and the shavian jabs at middle class society ( `` marriage - it 's the proper thing , but it 's not natural '' ) are wonderful and are just icing on an already rich cake . definitely worth a watch
