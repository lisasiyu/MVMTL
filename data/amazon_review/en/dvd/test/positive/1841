excellent i really liked this anime . a lot . especially the music . it 's so ... haunting . so of course i had to get my hands on the entire soundtrack . go get `` key to twilight '' . sometimes i just watched the thing to get the music . that 's not to downplay the goodness of the anime mind you . it was good . the only thing that made me sad was the open ending of the anime . you have to play the vid game for the entire storyline . and that sucks because as my husband says `` i have no game power . '' i had so many game overs i lost my passion for the game . i still do n't know how it ends . -sigh
