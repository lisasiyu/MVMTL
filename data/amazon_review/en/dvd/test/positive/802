apocolypto apocolypto is definately a violent movie . yet , somehow , the movie would not show the brutality and the horror of the aztec civilization if it watered down this part . instead , this movie is very real , and in mel gibson 's way , has a powerful message to tell . and in the final scenes of the movie , i could see how the 'want more ' of the aztec pursuing the young man could lead to corruption , and the ultimate death . this movie is shocking , but behind all the violence and gore , there is a message that anyone can see , and despite the `` r '' rating of this movie , this movie is definately worth watching . i thought it was extremely well done
