there 's a good chance you 'll hate this movie . if you 're anything like 80 % of the folks in the theater when i saw this film , you 'll probably start rolling your eyes , exhaling loudly , and moaning about 1/3 in . with that said , i thought it was fantastic . the fountain is flawed , for sure , in its pacing and its grandiosity , but what you get in return for patience is a very thoughtful and gorgeous experience . it 's clear that aronofsky really loved this project . other reviewers hsve said that this is n't so much a movie , but a work of art , and while i 'm a bit hesitant , i agree . do n't expect requiem for a dream . do n't expect a `` thrill ride '' . just watch it when you have the time/headspace to devote to it , and you 'll feel something , one way or the other . *the soundtrack , by the way , is nearly as beautiful as the film itself . definitely to be checked out
