sci fi that never goes out of style before buying any dr who series you should be aware that the special effects for the most part suck . however , the general plot is great and the plot lines are exceptional . this was a must have from my childhood , expecially since it was a tom baker ( the long scarfed doctor ) series . i enjoyed thoroughly because it brought to light the creation of one of the doctors most deadly enemies ( the daleks ) . it also contains a few characteristic one liners by tom baker .
