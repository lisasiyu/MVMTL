completely awesome ! the golden suns are here , finally ! this is an amazing set , and better than i remembered it as a kid ! compelling stories , good animation , great voice acting . tons of fun for any age . wish they made cartoons today as good as they did back in the `` day '' . the temple of the golden suns completely got me hooked on duck tales as a kid , and got me into reading the carl barks/don rosa comic books . i remembered it from , gosh , when i saw it in 87 ' , so it must have made a big impression ! go get it today - you wo n't be disappointed ! because life is like a hurricane
