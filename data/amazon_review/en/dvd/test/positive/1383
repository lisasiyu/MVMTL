beautifully filmed noir piece i really like this film . first of all it is absolutely beautiful to look at . tahoe and water water everywhere - all sumptuously photographed . the story is an emotionally intense rollercoaster of the lengths a mother will go to protect her children . intense , often suspensful and sometimes creepy , this is a keeper . swinton is amazing here - like one raw jangling nerve . she is amazing to watch . the rest of the cast is fine their roles , whether shady , clueless or sympathetic . well worth a view
