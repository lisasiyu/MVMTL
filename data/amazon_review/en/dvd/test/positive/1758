a bit light but nonetheless good historical wrap- up i think it 's hard to listen to everyone talk about what punk rock was - to sort of link mc5 to the clash from west coast to east coast - the reality is - like any art movement it meant different things to different people . and while one dyed in the wool punk might say robert fripp 's guitar solos were punk , another will tell you that guitar solos are self-serving , bloated , and not at all about punk . i 've always felt that musicianship , of one form or another , has always been necessary , the reality is good punk rockers learned their craft well , and quickly - good punk rock , for me and mine - was never about flouting lack of skill ( and it was n't honestly lacking from the great ones ! ) . it was also never about punk fashion for my friends and i , and mostly for the original punk bands it was n't much about the `` punk '' fashion either . this set of disks documents largely what we all already knew - that there 's really no such thing as a distinct punk rock movement - and that the garage bands of the sixties , and the rock and roll created in sun studios in the 50s was all incendiary and necessary to something young people needed to do in the mid to late seventies . the ny movement vs. the english movement is well documented if a little disjointed here . i never had much use for the romantic lyrical style of the new york scene and while patti smith is a genious - she was never a punk to my ears . punk needed not just attitude , fashion , or stylistic differences - it also needed something to rail against . and no one did that better than the pistols and the clash - or more specifically lydon and strummer . both individuals specifically missing for different reasons from this documentary . instead we are treated to henry rollin 's rolling eyes - just fine , a chubby james chance , pretty good , and even a slightly softened siouxie - as they all coast into middle age . much of the 80s scene is excused from this movie - husker du , the minutemen , the fall , manchester in general ( besides some quick footage of the buzzcocks and a second with pete shelley ( a bit more of devoto ) ) and scads more - for a treatement of nirvana . time to stretch and yawn if you 're me . i liked nirvana , i think cobain was brilliant - however , it 's not punk - and if green day or rancid get face time - it 's only because the audience was long built and harnessed into place by those what came before . as they say . it was fun to see rollins dish a bit out to the likes of limp bizkit and there 's some choice extras on the 2 dvd set . and it 's always interesting to hear biafra talk ( i like him , you may not ) . all in all a good purchase for those of you who never saw footage of mc5 , or some of the other seminal acts of the early to mid seventies ( who cares about the new york dolls ? ? ? ) . however , it is a bit short ... about 90 minutes . rock music of any genre to really be complete needs to spend more time with the performances and less time with the interviews/reviews . having the ramones bash out loudmouth is either going to grab you or not . sonic youth is a performance band , they are far better in person than any recording they 've done . having any sniffin ' glue or punk paper ( and god i miss those old tiny print mimeographed fanzines - there was something so intimate and delicious about them ) tell us it was a seminal moment is unnecessary . if you step in a ring and get trounced by a great boxer , you do n't need some sideline personality tell you you got your ass whipped . ok : ) have fun
