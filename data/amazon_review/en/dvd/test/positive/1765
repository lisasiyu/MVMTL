bubble boy this movie is hilarious ! jake gyllenhaal plays , jimmy , a young man who has lived in a bubble all of his life because he has no immunities . when jimmy 's love interest decides to marry someone else , jimmy must cross the country to get to niagra falls to stop the wedding . of course , he meets many new faces and adventures along the way . this movie makes me laugh no matter how crappy the day is so if you are interested in slap stick comedy , buy it and watch it with your friends . jake gyllenhaal is awesome as usual . this actor 's range is impressive..how 'd donnie darko go from living in a bubble to being a gay cowboy ? it is just neat .
