uplifting can you believe i just saw this movie . i had the pleasure of listening to liz murray at an awhonn convention . it 's not even that she is a seasoned speaker ... she told her story . i instantly was drawn to her . if you think you have problems ... well you can hardly believe someone could overcome all that she has . i left that convention with a whole different attitude about life . i can hardly wait for my girls to watch it , because all i have done is talk about her
