very old but very good considering when this musical was made , it is a great forerunner to the later broadway melody films . it is far superior to the remake with lana turner and joan blondell . in my opinion broadway melody of 1936 was the best broadway melody made . you ca n't really take anything away from broadway melody of 1929 , in as much as it presented itself with a lot of vigor , good cast and music which for its day surely had movie goers wondering when other musicals were coming . if you are a movie musical buff be sure to include broadway melody of 1929 in your collection
