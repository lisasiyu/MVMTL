highly recommended . for those who enjoyed `` road home '' here comes another wonderful version of an emotional film involving teachers . in this case the story is developing around the first love of an innocent village girl and the newly arrived teacher . in this mixture of sad and happy moments we can enjoy the innocence and purity of a young girl who discovers love for the first time , the effort of a teacher to remain impartial and fair as a teacher towards a girl that he started liking too . the involvement in the story of other teachers and people around their daily life , adds interest and emotion . soon the viewer is part of the story . the photography is magnificent and the music typical of the 60s . this wonderful selection of music is also a centerpiece in the development of the story . a very well balanced film , running smoothly and keeping the viewer interested , full of emotion , throughout the entire duration . highly recommended .
