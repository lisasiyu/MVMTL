the dark side of attachment reage 's o is the best-known of the sm novels , one of very few that has made it into the general awareness . this movie is a truncated version of the story , with some interesting differences . a movie is a visual presentation , so many details have been added or filled in . in that respect , the movie carries indelible marks of its 1970s origin - bell-bottom side burns , wide ties , and farrah fawcett hair for some of the women . bust implants were mostly unknown in the 70s , so the female figures are more natural and varied than in newer flicks , too . and , this movie comes from the time when `` safe sex '' meant not falling out of bed . in an effort to approach main-stream audiences , many of the book 's more repugnant elements have been dropped . still , here 's plenty of eroticism left in numerous synthesexual engagements . the movie 's pervasive theme of control , submission , and pain is intact . it will turn many people off - it was never meant to appeal to everyone , and does n't much appeal to me . the very last scene of the movie is a surprise , though . it 's quite unlike the book , and somehow made everything else make a lot more sense . //wiredweir
