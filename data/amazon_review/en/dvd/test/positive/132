love these workouts ! ! this dvd is great ! i watched the first 2 seasons of the show so i could relate to the people in the video , because i saw how much weight they have lost , and how their lives have changed by getting fit . those who have never seen the show can still relate to the participants because you can see that they are working hard and struggling also . i have lost 20 pounds in 5 weeks by eating healthy and doing this video daily . i mix n match work-outs each day .
