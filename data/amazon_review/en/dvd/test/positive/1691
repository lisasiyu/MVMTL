the dialogue cracks me up trekkies who are into the preservation of timeline and continuity probably had kittens when they watched this movie , but this movie worked because it highlighted the interplay of the cast - our favorite fictional characters . any two bit sci-fi director can make a movie with spaceships and any bean counter can keep a timeline straight , but we do n't watch star trek for these reasons , do we ? we watch them because only shatner , nimoy , and kelly can play kirk , spock , and bones . the scene where they 're talking about italian food in the pickup truck still makes me laugh today like the first time i saw it
