a beautiful , moving cinematic masterpiece one of the most recent additions to my film collection is vï¿½ctor erice 's espï¿½ritu de la colmena ( the spirit of the beehive ) , made in 1973 in spain . franco 's dictatorship was in its waning years - but the censorship the generalissimo had fostered still remained in effect - many directors of the day had to fight to have their films shown . if they portrayed anything that had to do with the spanish civil war - especially showing the resistance in a favorable light - they had to do it metaphorically . some films were cut to ribbons by the censors , some were delayed almost indefinitely - and some never saw the light of day ( or the dark of a cinema , if you like ) . erice 's first feature is set in 1940 , and shows a spain still reeling from the pain of the civil war . set in a small village on the castilian plain , the film speaks volumes about both the physical and psychological damage done by the conflict . the village is seen to be quite run down - the family at the center of the story lives in relative comfort in a large old manor house , but it , too , is in a state of neglect and disrepair . while quite spacious compared to the homes of their neighbors , the rooms are shown to contain little furniture - and the one meal we see the family sharing , a breakfast , is a sparse one . the members of the family seem to exist in their own isolated orbits - coming close to each other at times , but never really connecting . the two young sisters - ana ( ana torrent ) and isabel ( isabel tellerï¿½a ) - share more of a bond than the parents have with each other , or with their children . the girls ' father ( portrayed by popular spanish actor fernando fernï¿½n gï¿½mez ) is a beekeeper - the first time we see him in the film , he 's tending the hives , dressed in his protective gear , looking a bit like a space explorer . their mother ( teresa gimpera ) writes letters to an unnamed man - from the address seen on an envelope in one scene , a refugee from the fighting living in a camp in france . we never learn if he is a former lover , a relative , or just an old friend caught up in forces over which he has little control - but from the frequency of her letters to him , and the emotional depth of the words she writes ( which we hear in a voice-over ) , it 's obvious this is a person about whom she cares a great deal , and whose absence torments her . the girls are the real focus of the story - especially the youngest , ana . she appears to be around 6 years old - at that age when the fantasies of childhood are about to be pushed aside by the realities of life , a time of difficult transition for a child . she still accepts everything she sees as being real - fiction is an unknown concept to her . a travelling cinema comes to town , setting up in the town hall - it 's clearly something that has happened before , and we see the children gather around the van , before the dust has even settled , clamoring to know what film will be shown . on this occasion , it happens to be james whale 's 1931 classic version of frankenstein . ana and isabel are among the children and adults who crowd into the makeshift theatre to see the film . ana is captivated by the entire spectacle - and as i mentioned , she 's at the age when everything she sees on the screen is as real to her as what she sees on the street everyday . ana torrent , the young actress who portrays ana in the film , had never seen frankenstein before - and in one of the most moving scenes i 've ever witnessed in a film , we see her face in the dark , illuminated only by the light reflecting from the screen , as she reacts , honestly and openly , eyes wide in wonder , not acting , to the story before her . at one point , she leans over to her sister isabel and asks , `why did the monster kill the little girl ? why did they kill the monster ? ' isabel tells her later , as the girls lie in their beds , awaiting sleep , that `it 's all make-believe - nothing in the movies is real ' . ana 's not buying it . still obsessed with the experience and story of the film , she later listens intently to a story isabel tells her of a spirit that lives nearby , in an abandoned barn . isabel warns ana that the spirit will only appear when called by someone with a pure heart , who believes it is real . ana returns to the barn several times , calling `it 's me - ana ' , to no avail . after a few visits , she arrives at the barn to find it occupied - a wounded freedom fighter , on the run from franco 's guard , has taken shelter there . when he awakens with a start , hearing a noise , he immediately draws his pistol - seeing that it 's ana , he relaxes . ana is either determined that this man is the spirit she has been seeking , or simply decides to make him into the spirit , and befriends him - she offers him an apple , and later sneaks out of her house with her father 's jacket , to keep the man warm at night , inadvertently neglecting to remove her father 's pocket watch before handing it over to him . ana 's vision of this man as her own manifestation of the spirit is shattered when he is caught by franco 's police and killed . her father is called to the makeshift morgue - once again , using the town hall , returning to the scene of the film that affected ana so much - to view the body . the police captain has found the pocket watch on the dead man , and has connected it to ana 's father - he 's obviously been brought in for questioning , probably a common practice in a society under the shadow of franco 's paranoia . his assurances that he did n't know the man , or how his jacket and watch came to be in his possession , are evidently taken as truth , and he is allowed to take his property and go home . when he confronts ana with the watch , simply by opening it at the breakfast table and allowing the chiming mechanism to sound , it 's pretty apparent from her facial expression that she knows something about it . he later follows her to the barn - she does n't know that the man has been captured and killed - and when her father attempts to talk with her there , she runs from him . her failure to return home prompts a search party made up of villagers scouring the woods and countryside at night , carrying lanterns - a striking visual reminder of the scene in whale 's frankenstein when the villagers searched for the monster carrying torches . ana is found sleeping in the ruins of an old castle , and brought home , obviously traumatized . as we see her sleeping in the room she shares with isabel , we notice that isabel 's bed has been stripped of its linen - perhaps a sign that isabel , being a couple of years older , is now in her own room , having `grown up ' sufficiently in the eyes of her parents to warrant this `promotion ' . ana 's experiences have left her changed - but how much is unclear . the border she has crossed - or is beginning to take the first steps in crossing , at least - is one that is not skipped over in the course of a day or two . it 's something that takes years to accomplish . as the film ends , we see her poignantly calling out to her spirit once more , `it 's me - ana ' . the cinematography in this film is astonishingly beautiful - luï¿½s cuadrado worked miracles , not just in his camera angles and framing , but in capturing the honey-colored light that is so essential in conveying the feeling and atmosphere of this film . in the documentary the footprints of a spirit - one of the several fine extras included in criterion 's new dvd release of the film - director vï¿½ctor erice and his co-screenwriter angel fernï¿½ndez santos , speak of their original intended storyline , and how they wound up discarding the opening scenes - they said that once they started filming , they realized that the opening , looking back from the present to the time depicted in the body of the film , was a drag on the overall effect . it 's an interesting look into the creative process . as it turned out , the film is as close to perfect as cinema can get . criterion has done a masterful job in restoring and packaging it for re-release . since i 've never had the opportunity to see this work in a theatre on the big screen , i have nothing with which to compare it - but i can say that this is one of the most beautifully filmed , moving cinematic creations i 've ever experienced .
