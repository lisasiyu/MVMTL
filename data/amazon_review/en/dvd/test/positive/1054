enthralling `` winged migration '' was shown on pbs not long ago . i set my vcr to tape it . not having the time to check the length of the program , i had the vcr record it for one hour . as the tape played , i became totally enthralled by the majesty , strength , and beauty of the birds , the gorgeous photography , and perfectly accompanying music . then the taping cut off . the program had been one and one-half hours . i was missing the last half hour . far from being disappointed , however , it was a blessing in disguise . for this film is so extraordinary that a mere taping from cable does n't do it justice and i decided to buy the dvd if available . i searched pbs ; they did n't offer it . next stop : amazon . sure enough , they had it , and it arrived two days ago . the dvd is so magical i ca n't stop watching it . plus my purchase helps support these wonderful people who created this tribute to the wonderful birds . i have now returned to amazon to buy *five* more as gifts . i know i will be giving family and friends a wonderful experience when i give them a dvd of `` winged migration . '' it is an experience not to be missed
