heartbreaking i love these types of movies , b/c all of the reviews on this page are very thoughtful and interesting . i agree with most everything , but the one thing that keeps popping up that i do disagree with is the idea that the characters are totally unlikable . i personally find the characters extremely sympathetic . these people are all in incredible pain . they are miserable . not one single character is happy . they are all trying to medicate their pain , oblivious to the fact that the love they are all seeking is within arms reach , yet they step on each other to `` get theirs '' to such an extent that by the end no one is happy . yes , may is an incredibly bad mother , but she has been a shell of a person her entire life , with practically no joy whatsoever . ditto for the others . how in the world are these not sympathetic characters ? i have a lot of love in my life . of course i sympathize with those who have none .
