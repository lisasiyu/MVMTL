explores the `` unknown '' american revolution on the frontier this is a great movie that just gets better with the years . released in 1939 it had to compete with `` gone with the wind '' and `` the wizard of oz '' , so it ran a little under the radar . when it comes to the revolutionary war 99 % of people think gen. washington at valley forge , brandywine and the climatic battle at yorktown va. maybe more interesting and just as important was the war that was fought on the american frontier . that is the subject of this movie and it is done well . a boyish henry fonda plays gil martin and claudette colbert ( who received top billing over fonda ) stars as his wife , lana . clothing and props are authentic as well as the flintlock rifles that are used . john carridine does a great job as `` caldwell '' , the loyalist leader of the indian forces that attack the `` whig '' settlers . best of all it has been digitally remastered and looks better than ever . a special features section explains how this was done . it is good to finally see this movie on dvd and it should be in the library of everyone who enjoys historically based movies
