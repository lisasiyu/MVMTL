not my favorite seasons but still a must own ... . i had never watched mr. show up until a little over a year ago when they started playing it after midnite on tbs slightly edited . i was hooked and began recording every episode on tivo , until i realized they seemed to be edited so i picked up the 4th season and loved it , there were so many hilarious sketches on that thing , my favorite being the story of everest . i finally picked this up a few weeks ago and have watched it several times , and while i found myself laughing out loud often , i did n't find this to be as clever or funny as the 4th season , aside from one or 2 sketches , not too much really stick out like the majority of season four . a must own if you 're a true fan of the show , for the commentary alone
