a glorious sendoff for two fine actors . . . richard harris and oliver reed inhabit roles worthy of their larger than life talents in ridley scott 's glorious gladiator . the film has had many reviews , so my two cents are for harris and reed . everything about this marvelous , intimate epic is first-rate , and you must see it if you have not , and on a big screen tv if you can . richard harris as marcus aurelius , caesar for twenty-five years until his murder by his son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) , brings his authority and gentility to bear , never needing to raise his voice to be absolutely in charge . his caesar is a man , no more , no less , wondering if , after all these years , what does he truly leave behind ? how will history treat him ? we get to know him well through his conversations with his daughter lucilla ( connie nielsen ) as well as his trusted general , the son he wishes he had , maximus ( russell crowe ) . it was close to harris ' last role , and most definitely one of his best . harris has played kings in the past , but never this realistically . and what can you say about the late oliver reed ? along with harris , he was one of the last of the original brit hellraisers , and the wear and tear on his face and body make him the perfect proximo , former gladiator and now trying to make his fortune on other fighters . he does n't play proximo , he is proximo . you ca n't help but think of all the great roles reed played over the years , such as bill sykes in oliver , vulcan in baron munchausen , otto von bismarck in royal flash , athos in the three and the four musketeers , hannibal brooks in the film of the same name , and of course his performance as gerald crich with glenda jackson in women in love . his loss was a great one for not only the filmmakers of gladiator , but for all of us . take a look at the 200-minute documentary on disc two of this three dvd set and you will find a large portion devoted to reed , his unfortunate passing only three weeks from the end of filming , and how scott , the screenwriters and the rest of the crew of gladiator brilliantly completed reed 's wonderful performance . oliver is probably smiling down , guinness in hand , saying , `` good on you , mate . '' gladiator is an epic , to be sure , but ultimately it 's about people , and how they survive in a deadly time . djimon hounsou as juba , the spiritual center of the film , derek jacobi as senator gracchus , who wants to try to bring rome back to marcus aurelius ' dream , ralf moeller as hagen , who comes to respect maximus as a true leader , and all the cast turn in sterling performances . no one but ridley scott could have shepherded this film to as emotionally satisfying an experience as it is . ( i think he really should have gotten the oscar on this one : how could it be voted best picture , best sound , best visual effects and russell crowe best actor without acknowledging who pulled it all together and made it work ? ) see gladiator , check out everything on the three discs , and savor some of the best work from two wonderful actors : oliver reed and richard harris . we who are about to view salute you . .
