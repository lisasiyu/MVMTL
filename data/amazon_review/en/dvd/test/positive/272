watanabe 's new masterpiece samurai champloo has become one of the greatest anime series ever with this final volume . it ranks well beside cowboy bebop , watanabe 's other masterpiece of anime , and in many ways surpasses it . watanabe 's series , though based in fuedal japan , does not limit itself to those restrictions , instead taking a surrealistic view of history , which allows for both minor and huge discrepancies , and the larger the lie , the funnier the episode . along with the comedy , the story centers around great action and even greater music . but in this volume , drama dominates . all of the characters meet the conclusion of their own personal stories , while wrapping up their story as a group . jin faces a man directly linked to his past as a swordsman ; mugen faces a family bent on revenge for mugen 's past life as a pirate ; and fuu finally meets the sunflower samurai . though you may think i spoiled it , just watch and see , for none of these endings end exactly as you would expect . then , after all three of these linked episodes are finished , you are treated to a reggae-style rap sung partly in english but mostly in japanese . to me , this was the perfect ending theme to a series that relied heavily on its music . so as not to spoil , i 'll finish my review saying this . the end of samurai champloo is both exciting and a bit sad . it 's a perfect conclusion to a perfect anime series , and sufficiently answers all the questions left behind in the previous volumes . if you have any anime sense , then you 've already seen this anime and love it . if you do n't , then hurry and get this so that you can say you were one of the first to see one of the best . this anime was definitely worth me collecting every separate volume , and i 'd recommend the same for anyone else out there . right now , i 'm hoping watanabe takes the same direction he did with cowboy bebop and makes the samurai champloo movie
