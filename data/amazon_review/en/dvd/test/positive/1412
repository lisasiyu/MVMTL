i spit on your shoe i spit on your grave is a fun film for fans of wes craven 's `` last house on the left '' and other `` rape/revenge '' classics , there are some elements of this film that are genuinely gruesome , and others that are practically laughable , either way , it 's not a bad way to spend 100 minutes of your life , not if your like me anyway . joe bob brigg 's commentary on this film is a great treat for anyone who has heard about this picture because of it 's controversy , because he does a great job of explaining all of that , and also if your just a big movie buff and want to hear interesting facts about the movie , because that track is chock full of info that is a great addition and joe bob is pretty entertaining anyway , meir zarchi also has a commentary track on this dvd witch is interesting because i had heard that he had kept pretty quiet about this picture since making it , but frankly i was ready to fall asleep about 40 seconds into his track so i ca n't really say i found it that interesting , all in all `` i spit on your grave '' is a fun midnight movie for hardcore buffs , and curious horror fans alike
