top notch entertainment i could spend a paragraph or two telling you what the plot/story of this movie is about . or you could read any one of the hundreds of other reviews for this film , and find out that way . most of you probably know it by now , as it is . a few good men is on my ( and my wife 's ) list of top ten movies of all time ... .with plenty of good reasons . as it has been said in many other reviews , the acting in this film ( from all the supporting actors as well ) is excellent . the story is good too ... .very interesting , actually . it would be easy to look at this movie as simply a `` blockbuster '' kind of movie ... .which , essentially , it is . it 's got a-list talent in front of , and behind the camera ... .it made a hell of alot of money at the box office , so yes it 's a `` blockbuster '' . but it 's also a damn good story , as mentioned before . another thing i liked about this movie , was the fact that the writers avoided any romantic involvement between tom cruise and demi moore 's characters ... .something most other films on this scale would have done . and i know it 's been said in many other reviews , but i 'm going to say it again anyway ... .jack nicholson really is the cornerstone of this movie . no , not because of that famous `` you ca n't handle the truth ... . '' line . but because his acting really is that good . it seems so natural . his mannerisms are so natural , that he could pass for a real life military leader ... .i am in the military myself , so i can vouch for this . and even though this movie is over two hours , i was never once bored ... .you wo n't be either
