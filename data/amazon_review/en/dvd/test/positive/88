a good bit of drama mixed in with fun ... . y'know - i do n't care what anyone else says 'bout this film . i liked it so there ... : g : it was a good bit of childish fun at times , as well as a lot of drama . i cried my eyes out for those children because of their father being at war . it 's got funny stuff with the cousin and `` it '' , which eddie voices ever so brilliantly ... and i loved the aunt.. i knew she was something special , siding with the children and helping them . i loved her ! kenneth brannagh was hilarious as well . i do n't know - i just loved it . i think you should give it a dry . i think it 's a good mix between a typical family movie that has a good thing to say to the viewer and a fanstasy like cs lewis or even tolkien at times . the moral of the story ... wishes ca n't last forever ... but you 'll just have to see the movie to see what i 'm talking about , now wo n't you ? :
