a beautifully subtle and genuinely emotional film this is clearly one of the most polarising of jane austen adaptations on film . some viewers will love the genuinely moving acting , the authentically costumed characters , the beautiful scenery and sets , the incredible story-telling and the wonderfully subtle touches that abound in this film . others will loathe the complete absence of makeup , the fact that amanda root is visibly older than 29 , the slow and tender story , the use of natural lighting and the re-writing of the mr elliot sub-plot ( including his unforgivably and casually cruel behaviour towards mrs smith ) . i acknowledge both of these views . certainly amanda root does not enhance her natural sweet looks , and she does look a little too old for the part of anne elliot , but mon dieu , her acting ! that is something else again . in terms of the emotional involvement and the ability to subtly create this gentle and loving character , no better actress could have been found . if only she 'd been permitted to `` youthify '' her looks a little ... after all , in the novel she is described as a very pretty girl - although it 's true her looks had faded somewhat , her appearance revives mid-way through the novel to the point where she has enough beauty to attract the admiration of passing gentlemen - but to be honest , i do prefer superb acting to superb looks , and that is why i find amanda root 's portrayal so very moving and real . ciarï¿½n hinds is excellent as captain wentworth , anne 's love whose proposal she rejected some years ago . he is not movie-star handsome , but a well-looking man whose serious demeanour is not cloaked by his occasional more lively ripostes . in personality and character , he is undeniably the right match for ms root 's anne . the interaction between the two of them is so gracefully subtle that it might be missed by viewers who expect a more obvious approach . he is very deliberately ignoring anne , although with perfect politeness . more and more , the appreciative viewer will notice that there is a quite remarkable sensitivity between the two of them , and the beauty of anne 's character is so wonderfully brought out by amanda root 's acting that the love between these two characters is truly and fully realised . the sub-plots are also superbly explicated . anne 's selfish and heedless father ( corin redgrave ) and monstrously insensitive and vain sister elizabeth ( phoebe nicholls ) , not to mention her laughably tiresome sister mary ( sophie thompson ) , are so well played that one becomes genuinely outraged on anne 's behalf as one sees their carelessly selfish behaviour . mr elliot ( the brilliant samuel west ) does n't really get enough storytime in this adaption , unfortunately - i do think the script did n't quite manage to include his motivations and personality well enough for a proper understanding of his character . but the wonderful fiona shaw is perfect in the role of mrs croft ( anne 's put-upon friend who has fallen upon hard times ) , and lady russell ( anne 's mentor ) is just sheer delight in her well-meaning snobbery as played by susan fleetwood . i also found absolutely perfect the self-seeking mrs clay ( felicity dean ) and the thoroughly nice charles musgrove who , having been rejected by anne , decided to wed mary instead ( very , very well played by simon russell beale , who makes this sort of role look completely effortless ) . the look of this film is lovely in many ways . the lack of makeup may take some getting used to , but there 's no denying it 's authentic , and with such excellent acting from everyone involved , the dynamics of the film are unsurpassed . the truly magnificent singing of opera singer rosa mannion in one of the scenes is the first truly appropriate musical performance in any jane austen film . ( all too often , the standard of singing or playing in this sort of film is clearly 'quite nice ' , but certainly not the result of natural talent honed by years of training - as would indeed have been the case with young ladies of the genteel class . or ... if no natural talent was possessed , perhaps the young lady in question would learn the harp instead of singing . but music was an essential asset for any damsel of the period who had any pretensions at all to social graces . ) to sum up : for those who want a film that is purely escapist , that is full of lovely-looking people floating about in 18th century clothing and that is `` exciting '' to watch , this is probably not a film that will appeal to you . for those , however , who are willing to plunge solely into the subtleties of this film and its beautifully moving performances , there will be great enjoyment for you
