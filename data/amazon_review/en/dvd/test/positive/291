dance on first , let me start off by saying i think the casting choices for this movie were perfect . i had doubts that the movie would be any good , because i 'm not exactly a fan of jennifer lopez 's acting , but she did a brilliant job playing her part . the movie had great sensual dance seens , and a substantial , interesting storyline to go with it . i 'm addicted to dance movies , and anyone who says a dance movie with older people in it ca n't be good is definitely wrong . richard gere was amazing . this movie rocked
