another pearl from dr. yang , jwing ming and david silver having owned the videotape of this offering from dr. yang , i was a little apprehensive about spending money to buy the dvd . i was very satisfied with the information offered on the vhs tape , but having already owned the material , it did n't make sense to purchase a dvd unless there was something added to the material . generally , when a company releases a dvd of a previously released vhs tape , there is very little added to the dvd release . fortunately , in line with the high quality of ymaa publications , this dvd has approximately two hours of material that was not on the original vhs . combine this with the ease of access that a dvd offers and the taijiquan , classical yang style dvd becomes even more of a bargain . the video offers material and instruction for the following : the taijiquan thirteen postures the fundamental 8 stances taiji qigong , with stretching and three sets taught the yang style taijiquan sequence ( the long form ) the video also has an extensive lecture on taijiquan theory by dr. yang as well as a demonstration of fa jing and a list of all the movements of the long form . the lecture is vital to anyone who wants to learn taijiquan . merely imitating the postures and movements , which sadly is how many people practice taijiquan , without an understanding of the philosophy from which taijiquan developed , would severely limit one 's experience . dr. yang discusses how taiji is between wuji ( nothingness ) and yin and yang . this concept is extremely important and vital to the performance and practice of taijiquan . when you begin the form , you should stand in a beginning posture which represents wuji , or nothingness/emptiness , during which you settle the body , relax the breath and bring all the parts of your body and mind into this wuji state . then the thought/intention is born in the mind and the taiji ( which came from the wuji ) splits into the yin and yang . the dead hands and body , maximum yin , become alive and slowly inflate and expand to a balance between maximum yin and maximum yang , along with the whole body . now the form begins . i see many practitioners walk up , stand still for one second and leap into the form without any understanding of where yin and yang spring from . the transition from wuji to taiji to the interplay of yin and yang is one of the more fulfilling and engaging aspects of taijiquan . dr. yang points out that taiji , the theory of which is explained so well in this video , has been around for approximately four thousand years , whereas taijiquan has been around for perhaps a thousand years . the use of this theory in daoism is also explained by dr. yang . the link between taijiquan and daoism through their mutual use of the philosophy of taiji was one of the initial reasons for my interest in learning taijiquan . dr. yang goes on to illustrate through the use of scientific formulas the relationship of taijiquan and the laws of physics . this lecture is just the preparation to begin to use the other parts of the video . too many times tapes are presented by martial artists with little thought for tying it all together and explaining the meaning of what is offered . this video is extremely well thought out and presents the viewer with a strategic approach that will enable them to go far in their quest to learn taijiquan . throughout the video there are visual clues as to when to inhale and when to exhale while doing the form or the taijiquan qigong . the demonstration of the long form offers detailed instructions when you click on the yin-yang symbol . i would have to write a ten page review to give justice to all the material presented on this dvd . a wonderful addition to dr. yang 's presentations and a worthwhile purchase even if you already own the vhs version of this video .
