this has a some memorable moments murphy was at his best in this . this was the era where eddie murphy was the `` it '' guy . everything he did turned to gold . and back then , this was gold . samuel l. jackson was unknown in the eighties even though he was earning his living out of acting in hollywood films . at the beginning of this movie he plays the father of eddie murphy whose raw , cutting edge humor raises eyebrows and complete silence amongst his family . i have watched `` raw '' many times and found it very funny to a point . the last 25 minutes are kind of dull , and not much , if any laughs but it 's pretty much a laugh riot up until the last 25 minutes or so . the funniest parts include the bill cosby , and richard pryor imitations , and the part about eddie wanting a mcdonald 's hamburger as a kid . even when it loses its momentum toward the end , i still watch this disc just for that .
