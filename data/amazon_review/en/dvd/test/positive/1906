i loved it ! ! the first story `` the spiderwoman '' was very good . 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion . it was a good story line with some humor thrown in there . the second story `` crevices '' was amazingly awesome . 5 out of 5 stars in my opinion . to me it was a genius story line . the only problem is that this story should have gotten some more showtime . it was the creepiest one on the dvd . norio tsuruta did i very good job . so ... congrats to him : ) the third story `` the sacrifice '' had a good story line to it . 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion . i think they could have done something to make the hideous head a little more ... scarier though . the fourth story `` blonde kwaidan '' was horrible ! 1 out of 5 stars in my opinion . i 'm sorry ... but there was really no story line to it . it hardly explains anything ... it was just a waste of film . the film used for this story should have been used to make `` crevices '' a bit longer ; ) the fifth and final story `` presentiment '' was pretty good . 3 1/2 out of 5 stars in my opinion . it was kinda slow a bit , but it really did have a good story line to it . all and all this was a very good dvd . glad i bought it . i have no regrets . ( except for watching `` blonde kwaiden '' )
