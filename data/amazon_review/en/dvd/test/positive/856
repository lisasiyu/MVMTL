harryhausen takes the torch from o'brien with these classics ! if i think of a cyclops , there is only one that comes to mind ( i know there were two in this movie ) . it is the cyclops in the 7th voyage of sinbad . if i think of a fire breathing dragon , it is from this great movie i see the definative dragon ! ray harryhausen has created so many incredible creatures it is amazing that there are some people out there that just do n't know what they are missing . the golden voyage of sinbad is another classic included in this set . the least of the three movies included in this set is sinbad and the eye of the tiger , it is a good installment showing what a master craftsmen harryhausen had become ! the dvd set has great transfers and some nice extras . this is essential harryhausen .
