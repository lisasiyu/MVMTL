a movie they would never make today ! this is a great film . but , sadly , it would never be made today . i mean , try to imagine a film in which a 15 or 16 year of character has an abortion and it is taken as just another plot point . ( compare this to crowe 's singles which brought back the oh so convienent miscarriage , like something out of a 1940 's movie . ) also , imagine a film begin made today which invests so much time in developing its characters . yep , you ca n't . so enjoy it for what it is , a window on a lost world .
