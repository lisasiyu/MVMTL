30 year-old ... going on 40 perhaps kurosawa 's most darkly comic , `` fun '' movie . based very loosely on a 1929 dashiell hammett ( author of the maltese falcon and the thin man ) novel entitled , red harvest , yojimbo employs many of the same conventions . namely , the nameless protagonist who finds himself in the supremely corrupt town , and , warned to leave , stays on to punish the guilty . mainly for his own cynical amusement . the yojimbo character is the worldly anti-hero , and the only truly self-aware person in the entire movie . he sees power-hunger , avarice , and cowardice for what they are and knows all too well how to manipulate the two warring factions into destroying each other . he is a ronin , a masterless samurai . literally translated , it means `` wave-man '' or one who has been cast adrift on the waves . no master to serve but his own need to eat , his own whim , and no devices beyond his sword and resourcefulness . it is easy to discount the yojimbo character as completely cynical , as a man loyal to none , who kills for the mere implementation of a plan , or for profit . but for as skewed his morality may be , i can not agree . the yojimbo character invariably throughout the course of the film makes moral choices , but denies all sentimentality in making them and claims ( though probably falsely ) other reasons for his actions : he frees the woman kept prisoner by the sake brewer and helps her escape with her family ( giving them the money given him by one of his yakuza bosses ) ; he spares the life of the foolish farm-boy who ran away to be a gambler only to cry for his mother at his first brush with death ; and upon hearing the news that the inn-keeper ( his only ally up to this point ) has been imprisoned , he nearly rushes off to face down the dangerous and gunslinging tatsuya nakadai and co. , armed with only a small knife . it is as if he views `` normal '' people differently . as if the samurai and yakuza are classes of people , like himself , who have accepted this violent way of life . that , having made that choice , anything that comes their way -- including death or dismemberment -- should not be a surprise or thought twice about . toshiro mifune 's character may kill an evil man for amusement or for his own end , but he would not harm or rob an innocent man or debauch an innocent woman . he may be `` a hungry dog , following the smell of blood '' , but it is not the blood of honest people . in the dain curse , another of dashiell hammett 's books about the character from red harvest ( known in several books and two dozen short stories as only `` the continental op '' -- an operative for the continental detective agency ) , the nameless man is told , smilingly , by the book 's heroine that he is a monster ... but a nice one , and good to have around when things are dark . i think that very much sums up the yojimbo character as well , and also about how the character sees himself . some critic in a review i read wrote that tarantino does not make movies about violence so much as he makes movies about violent people , and their lives and thoughts and beliefs . i would say that yojimbo and its excellent , hilarious , and insightful sequel sanjuro certainly fall into that category . i think that yojimbo is often written off by pseudo-intellectuals as kurosawa 's foray into `` popcorn cinema '' , but i could n't disagree more . i believe that this favorite movie of mine was kurosawa 's expression of the philosophy of action , of confrontation , of a 1960s jaded-but-not-corrupted good versus evil . also , i would like to add , it has one of the best musical hero 's themes in all of cinema
