inexpensive backstage tour i rated this only four stars because the audio track on my dvd was out of sync with the video . it appears that the film to dvd transfer did n't compensate for the film audio being several frames ahead of the images . on the other hand i now have images of the utilidors . i managed to take two backstage tours of walt disney world during the 1990 's . the keys to the kingdom tour and the three-park backstage magic tour were expensive and took up an entire day -- but i thought them worth the trouble and expense . it took me three years to book the backstage magic tour , and for several good reasons i did n't get to take home photographs of the backstage areas such as the utilidors . modern marvels provided me video images to keep these vital infrastructure of walt 's utopian village fresh in my mind . i learned about the new expedition everest ride , and how the tree of life was grown by the imagineers . i love the monorail system and the contemporary resort -- featured ! this dvd lets me tour walt disney world and its secrets in the comfort of my home , without flying cross-country and putting up with crowds . it is n't `` the real thing , '' but this dvd allows me to scratch my walt disney world itch until i get the time and a couple of thousand dollars to return to orlando
