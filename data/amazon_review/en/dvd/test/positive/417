exhilerating ! i 've been doing this workout for several months , and it 's still challenging ! but everytime i do it , i feel invigorated and strong ! basic kickboxing moves are repeated and built upon , and the instructors ' explicit descriptions ensure that each move is done properly and effectively . and her accent is pretty cool ! legs/butt , arms/shoulders , cardio/aerobics , and abs are all covered ... the perfect well-rounded workout ! highly recommneded !
