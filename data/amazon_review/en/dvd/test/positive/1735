the critics did n't get it . so who listens to critics ? the frisco kid , directed by robert aldrich , is the quirky inventive saga of a young polish rabbi who is sent to america in 1850 to take over a congregation in san francisco . getting there proves to be quite a test of his stamina , his adaptability , and his religious faith . gene wilder 's performance as avram is a jaunty , sweet , and convincing triumph of comic bravado . after docking in philadelphia , the rabbi plays good samaritan to three nare-do-wells who later rob him and strand him in a strange land . fortunately he comes upon some amish farmers who give him shelter and money to resume his trek . after a brief stint working on the railroad , avram meets tommy lillard ( harrison ford ) , a bank robber with a heart of gold and a quick temper . the two team up and go ricocheting from one adventure to another -- an escape from a posse , a trial by fire at the hands of some native american indians , a visit to the brotherhood of silent monks , and two violent encounters with the bad boys who robbed avram in philadelphia . gene wilder and harrison ford are one feisty team as rabbi and rescuer in this rough-'n'-ready romp that rivals wilder 's earlier blazing saddles in wild west hilarity . director robert aldrich is a seasoned hand at blending roughhouse and laughter , as fans of his earlier the dirty dozen and the longest yard will attest . with a full posse of screen talents , the frisco kid rides tall in the comedy saddle . movie critics of the era panned the movie saying : `` the pairing of gene wilder and a young harrison ford may sound intriguing , but this film is not . it 's a startlingly unfunny comedy in which most of the jokes misfire and the evolution of the characters is forced and unbelievable . wilder is a great comedic talent , but salvaging this material is beyond him . '' evidently they were n't looking for a good time . talk of plot character 'evolution ' should be worried about in film making classrooms . i think they should have actaully sat back and just enjoyed the romp . the frisco kid is an offbeat comedy that manages to convey the sturdy faith of a believer . avram will not travel on the sabbath for any reason ; he returns his share of the money from lillard 's bank robbery ; he transmits the joy of judaism to the indians ; and he agonizes over murdering a man in self-defense . whereas this movie will probably not become a smash with the public , it is highly regarded for the religiously sensitive .
