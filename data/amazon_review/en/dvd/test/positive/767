not for the little ones -- a review of leapfrog 'storybook factory' in the product description it says that this video is for the 3 to 6 year old age range , but having children in that range myself , i can tell you that this is incorrect . for unlike the other leapfrog videos , this one is really meant for older children who are either on the verge of reading , or who have just started reading . i say this from observation of my son ( 3.5 ) and daughter ( 5.5 ) and their friends . those of them that are almost reading , or who are sounding out short words and sentences , understand the importance of punctuation and 'get ' the songs and the points of the story which emphasize inflection and reading naturally ( chunking ) . for the younger ones it just passes over their heads which is perfectly understandable since they have n't a good idea of what sentences and paragraph structure is all about . five stars . it 's short , but for the right kids it 's an invaluable tool for teaching about story structure and reading . young children will watch lily , tad and the gang , but do n't expect them to learn much . but buy this video . if you have the other videos ( which are amazing ) go ahead and get this one to go along with them . when the time is right , your child will just absorb this information like they did their letters
