liquid tv revisited this move gets my vote as i 'm some one of the liquid tv era i enjoyed see the animated aeon take a real person roll . the movie leaves room for sequals as was the idea with origonal animated version . hopefully there will be more to come . she 's hot for being as dressed as she is compared to the origonal animation . the science fantacy special affect were new and innovative without being dark in it violence . it would be nice if mtv was still as entertaining as aeon
