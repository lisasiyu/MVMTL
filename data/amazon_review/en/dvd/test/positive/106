good relationship movie i really enjoyed this movie if only for joan allen 's portrayal of a bitter blooming-alcoholic living in the 'burbs with 4 beautiful daughters around 15 to 21 . kevin plays a retired baseball player now dj ( for wrif-fm , the station i listened to often in detroit when i was in my late teens and early '20s ) . he too drinks way too much . they find solace in each other . i loved watching joan allen and the movie does have a good script . i liked all the major characters in it except one . all but the detestable middle age guy . he only goes out with young women is made to be the guy you love to hate . i think most women over 40 will like this movie . i highly recommend it to them and anyone who enjoys films about relationships .
