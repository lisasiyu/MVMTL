unexpected barbs of humor ; great score ; worth it i expected a hystrionic-filled movie , and was pleasantly surprised by wisecracker oscar levant . he makes the film . of course , whenever you buy one of these joan crawford works , you 're going to get her flashing , emotive persona , but the stiletto-sharp writing and the beautiful score keep you from cringing . it 's a treat to be front row at one of the several oscar levant / james garfield ( really isaac stern ) piano/violin duets . this film is worth the investment . you will want to revisit the musical performances .
