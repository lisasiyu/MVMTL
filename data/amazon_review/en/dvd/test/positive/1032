a stirring wwii film ! dana andrews is excellent as the captain of a downed army air corps b25 bomber over japan . these us flyers are captured and put on trial in a civilian court in front of the international press for suppossed & quot ; crimes against humanity & quot ; . the japanese secretly torture the airmen one by one trying to discover if they came from a land base or a carrier . the story basically revolves around whether or not the american airmen will tell the japanese what they want to know . the final minutes of the film are quite stirring . the film music master , alfred newman did the score for the film and cleverly chose not to use very much underscoring music until the final scene in the film . although the music he uses is borrowed and not original his adaptation of it is powerful
