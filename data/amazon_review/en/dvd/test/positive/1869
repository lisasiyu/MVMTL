oscar winning comedy john cleese brought his monty python insanity and `` fawlty towers '' confusion to a fish called wanda , a hilarious caper film about a diamond heist and all the double-crosses that come with it . what i really appreciate about the film is that comedy finally got its due : kevin kline won the best supporting actor oscar for his inspired portrayal of otto , the intense but dense hit man who loves spouting philosophy but ca n't hide his overwhelming ignorance of everything else . twenty years later , i still laugh out loud at his performance . i believe michael palin won the british academy award for best supporting actor as well -- and he 's hilarious as well ! ( i 've always thought that comedy films have always been shortchanged : peter sellers should have won for dr. strangelove and steve martin should 've been at least nominated for all of me and then nominated for best supporting actor for little shop of horrors . ) everything about wanda works , even the little winks such as the name of cleese 's character , archibald leech -- which was cary grant 's real name ( grant and cleese both come from the same part of england ) . a fish called wanda is a comedy worthy of serious study . no kidding
