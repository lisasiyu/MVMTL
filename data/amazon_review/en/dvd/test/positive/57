good cop movie this is more realistic then some may admit . you see it all the time in the stories on tv , reality is twisted to the point where no one knows what the truth really is , best example is michael jackson . everyone has their opinions and the media is a great tool to use if you have the power to get it on your side . that is what this movie is all about . the movie depicts the evil intentions of 2 immigrants trying to become movie stars by filming their brutal murders . the plot was pretty original . i do n't think i have seen any other movie doing this although i may be wrong . it was interesting how they were using the hand held camera video for a lot of the scenes to help with the realism . you can see behind what was being shown on the video he was shooting . there was quite a bit of satire and irony in this movie . almost to the point of overwhelming , but overall i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good cop movie . i would say that this is somewhat similar to the movie paparazzi . storylines are a bit different , but both show how the media changes things around to make the better story .
