good information ... i bought this dvd and i was not disappointed . i give it a 4 only because there was n't complete balance in all of the `` experts '' . particularly the mary magdelene expert . not that it really mattered , but there was now counterpoint to her beliefs that `` jesus used to kiss mary on the mouth , much to the disciples chagrin '' . for those who claim bias , i would slightly disagree . dan brown has said that his book was fiction . so for national geographic to create a documentary investigating something that was ficticious from the start is admirable . some amazon reviewers call this dvd biased and even believe that the catholic church funded the dvd . i honestly beg to differ . the da vinci code is a fanciful story . so for national geographic to take the bait and create this dvd , gives dan brown more exposure . if anything , this dvd portrays the early catholic church as misogynous with their negative and false depiction of mary magdelene . the debunking of the priory of sion with its exclusive membership is comical as well . but they had to research it as it was derived from the book . the dvd bonus features are pretty good as well . they give you a little true/false quiz at the end . man will continue to search for proof . however , those who believe in god ( and have a relationship with him ) , need not apply empirical evidence or follow logical conclusions to prove or disprove the da vinci code . even if the da vinci code was completely true ( which it is n't ) , that would n't change my faith or belief . this is something that the dvd touched on . it is christ 's message that is important , not necessarily his social life .
