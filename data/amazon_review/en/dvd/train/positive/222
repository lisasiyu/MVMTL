a beautiful story of love and family there comes a point in almost everyones life when we wake up and realize we 're no where close to where we thought we 'd be . i 'm only 21 and i have had that day . george ( kevin kline ) has had one too . he 's a forty-ish architech who 's fallen out of touch with his estranged ex-wife and his children , most notably his teenage son . whats worse yet is that , upon realizing his failure as a parent , he finds out that he has n't much time to make it better . he 's been diagnosed with cancer and his time is short . george decides to get to know his son by building his dream home with him . george 's son ( played brilliantly by newcomer hayden christensen , and if you 'd seen chistensen on the tv show higher ground then you already knew he could pull this off ) is far from thrilled about the quality time he 'll be spending with his father and is determined to get out of it , or at least make his father miserable during the process . what 's heartwrenching is that george has n't told anyone about his condition , but once it 's revield you can only imagine the heartache in store for the central charactors , including his ex-wife played by kristin scott thomas . kevin kline gives the performance of his career here , as does christensen who plays the gothic loner prostitute with so much conviction you feel for him every second of this film . as the movie winds down to its tear jerker of an ending you 'll be left wondering if you 've done all you could to be the best father/son/mother/wife/husband you could so that when you pass you 'll be remembered favorably . one can only hope . beautiful film..
