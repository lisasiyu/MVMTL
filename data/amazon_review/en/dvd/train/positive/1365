one woman , and what a woman , against them all hard to make an action film with a woman as the main character , against all the indiana joneses and bruce lees of the world . difficult to transform a video-game character into a real flesh and bone cinema character , against all the draculas and frankensteins who did the reverse trip . they had to bring some kind of english fabula into the picture , accent , tea and everything else , plus a touch of cambodian safran buddhism and an ice-cube of siberian whitish russianism . and it all works if you also add a pinch of extra-terrestrial magic that looks more like some arabian astrology than anything from another constellation . but it does not really matter . lara croft is ready to run her first race with her chamber-valet and her rocking technical agent . and it works as much as we can hope , and in the end we can say the most admirable characters of the film are the sleigh-dogs who bring her back to her english mansion somewhere in a somewhat rainy tolerable climate . we recognized though some typical inspiration from the extremely british clive barker , but that might have been an illusion . dr jacques coulardeau , university of paris dauphine & university of paris i pantheon-sorbonne
