another great dora video ! my son loves this ! we are accumulating the dora dvds one at a time because i get tired of hearing the same ones over and over ... but i must say that dora is just about the only one that does n't get on my nerves . i even catch myself watching her from time to time . this has some movement for the kids to participate in , some learning , and fun songs . an all around great dvd for the little ones .
