`` i saw you in an orange grove ... '' james mangold identity is one hell of a movie . the twist is amazing , did n't see that coming . the ending will shock you to pieces . john cusack and amanda peet are superb in their roles , he plays a former cop and she plays a hooker trying to get home to flordia . clea duvall also appears in this film , duvall was previously in girl , interrupted ( another mangold film ) . this film kept me interested for all its 90 minutes . great direction , top-notch acting , and awesome plot . identity is the best pyschological thriller of all-time , i highly recommend this engrossing little film
