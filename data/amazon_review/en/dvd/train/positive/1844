amazing ! brings colonial india to life . as a great fan of the book , i was slightly apprehensieve about seeing the tv series . however , i really feel it does the book justice and brings the characters and india to life with its fantastic scenery and sumptuous costumes . amy irving is perfect as anjuli and although unsure at first of ben cross 's performance , i soon warmed to him as ash . the picture on the dvd was really good , as was the sound . a must see dvd for anyone who is interested in the history of india
