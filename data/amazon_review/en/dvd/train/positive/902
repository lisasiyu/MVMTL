great b grade horror ! i went into watching this film a little aprehensive . i love horror movies but 99 % are usually never scary in the least bit . ( usually they are just very fun to watch ) this movie was creepy as hell and has a high amount of tension that continues to build . it actually freaked me out which is very hard to do . this film and malevolance are the only 2 horror films to give me that gut feeling of fright that i crave from this genere of movies in about the past year or so . my dog even started growling at the tv and barking being the savage gaurd dog that he is . if you love horror films than this one is a must see , the story is very similar to and is basicly a mix of wrong turn and the texas chainsaw massacre , and they pull it off very wel
