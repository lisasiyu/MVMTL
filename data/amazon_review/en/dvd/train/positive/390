thoroughly entertaining this is a really good movie with an excellent excellent screenplay . the movie begins with the birth of punk , when a small roomful of people were fortunate enough to catch the sex pistols when they first came out , changing the course of music , and ends with the death of acid . as tony wilson puts it in the film , it is the `` story of manchester , '' that begins when a group of young and idealistic local boys decide to screw london and its record companies and start producing their own records out of manchester , and boy , has music history benefited from this decision . it 's interesting to note that as these young lads on the forefront of the music scene in manchester began to age , they become less idealistic as they were in their youth , and more acknowledging of reality and its limits . my only complaint is that i wish the movie could have had more on joy division and new order , than on the happy mondays . why did tony wilson ever sign a band that came in last place in manchester 's battle of the bands ? ? ? the casting for this movie is outstanding , as well . two big thumbs up . p.s . i do n't know why they used the cover that they did for the dvd . it really has nothing to do with the film
