f troop another `` must buy '' box set along with numerous other american tv shows ( a list too long to mention ) . i live in the uk and the tv stations here seem reluctant to show classic tv even with the advent of satellite/cable . i used to be very envious of american viewers who had access to tv land , however i now see that they no longer show classic shows from the 60 's preferring to now stick to shows from the 80 's onwards . i purchased season 1 when it was released and laughed from start to finish , even my wife who never saw the original limited run of the show enjoys watching it and laughs just as much as myself . i ca n't remember much about season 2 although i will when i watch the dvd , one thing i do remember is that it was very funny and would recommend anyone to purchase it
