brainy baby - abc's believe it ! ... this is a great video . brainy baby just seems to really know how to connect with children when it comes to teaching . the lady who gave this a one star and wrote a book about her feelings , is a bit over the top and has way too much time on her hands . we also homeschool our children and found that this video really helped them when they were younger to learn the alphabet . remember , this is a preschool video ! your children are being introduced to learning situations , not studying for a college exam ! we have found that all the brainy baby videos are top quality and do an excellent job of teaching . our boys knew the entire upper /lower case and all the letter sounds around 16-18 months ! it was amazing and i know that these videos played a big part in that . i am also impressed that all of their videos have a very specific educational outline that all my teacher friends say is excellent for teaching preschoolers . after doing a little research , i found a little known fact that it was brainy baby that created the first set of `` infant-preschool '' videos over 10 years ago ( way before the einstein series ) . so , that really gave me confidence that the producers at brainy baby really had the experience and track record . my advice , i do n't see how you could go wrong for a mere $ 15 investment in your child 's future . i own all of them and wish brainy baby would make more !
