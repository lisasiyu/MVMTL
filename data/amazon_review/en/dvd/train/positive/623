european arthouse movie par excellence `` intimacy '' is sexually explicit and raw , as one would almost expect from a european `` art-house '' movie . the sex scenes are n't really the focal point of the movie -- it merely establishes the setting for our protagonists , jay and claire . the story becomes quite intriguing as jay decides that he wants more than just anonymous weekly romp with claire . acting by timothy spall is excellent as usual . he is awesome in serious roles
