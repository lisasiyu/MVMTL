the best comedy ... ever ! this movie has been my # 1 comedy for many years ... still is ... and most likely will continue to be for many years to come . it speaks to anyone `` raised '' in a cubicle - you will find in almost all the characters `` someone '' you knew at some point in your life , when you worked at `` so and so '' . so many real-life scenarios i felt as if someone had been watching me with a camera back in those days ! and every time i 've watched it ( and yes ... that number is in the `` double '' digits ) i always find something that i overlooked or have forgotten about and rediscover it with delight and laugh out loud all over again , as if for the first time ! a true gem ! feeling blue ? just pop this movie ... you 'll forget your worries - if only for a couple of hours..
