excellent continuing the high standard set by the quality of episodes from the third season , season 4 of star trek : the next generation maintains a high standard throughout . the conclusion of the previous season 's cliff-hanger `` the best of both worlds '' does not disappoint , it 's the rollercoaster finish we were all hoping for . it does n't end there though , the writers were brave enough to not have the next episode be `` back to normal '' as star trek is so good at doing but write a real character episode `` family '' mainly dealing with picard 's trauma after being assimilated by the borg . there are n't any terrible episodes this season , qpid is a bit silly with the crew as robin hood characters - most of the stories are strong . `` future imperfect '' continues the brinkmanship between the federation and the romulans ( with andreas katsulas of babylon 5 fame and riker telling picard to `` shut up '' ) , `` data 's day '' is an entire episode from data 's perspective , `` the wounded '' introduces us to the cardassians , `` first contact '' is what star trek 's all about , then we get into `` the mind 's eye '' and `` redemption '' where the romulan , klingon and federation triangle plot finally starts to come out .
