great content - lousy packaging ! i 'm in the uk and therefore it cost me quite a lot to have this package shipped over the atlantic but it 's the only way to see this series until way into next year . as has been reported below the packaging is very poor because the dts disc ( the very one i want ) is not secured correctly on the double disc spindle and has been bouncing around for the last 4000 miles ! the disc surface is now scratched and damaged . i see no point in sending it back to amazon for replacement because the chances are it 'll happen again so i 'll have to try and get it repaired which is a nuisance . this item would have got five stars were it not for this problem and it 's a great shame
