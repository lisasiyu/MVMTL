`` sometimes the god 's bless you in the morning and curse you in the afternoon '' i must admit that initially i did n't want to watch this movie . i 'm not a big brad pitt fan and i viewed this as just another vehicle for brad to strike a glamorous pose or two and nothing more . fortunately i changed my mind and gave it and chance and i 'm happy i did . 'troy ' released in '04 is an epic of grand proportions , brilliantly directed with a crisp script , stellar cast and memorable soundtrack . brad pitt was perfect for the part of achilles as was eric bana as hector . i would also like to credit peter o'toole for delivering one of his best performances in years as priam , king of troy , diane kruger as the lovely helen and sean bean in the role of king odysseus
