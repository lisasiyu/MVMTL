i really like this one ; - ) to be honest , the firm is n't one of my favourite series . often , there are instructors not giving clear cuing and they can be out of time . for some reason , i decided to give this a go and i 'm glad i did because it 's one of the better workouts of theirs . there is lots of variations in movements and music so it 's kept fresh and interesting . for once i found the cuing very very precise and right on time . the instructor , alison davis , not only cues well to let you know what 's coming up , but also tells you all the time about proper form and technique . the mix of toning and aerobics is perfect and i 've found results already . it 's a little over 50 minutes all up , and all you need is two sets of dumbbells . it 's using basic choreography but the level is probably not for complete beginners - more of an intermediate to advanced level . it 's fun and i like to do this once or twice a week along with my other routines and dvds . i thoroughly recommend this
