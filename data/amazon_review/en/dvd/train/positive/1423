relevant and thought-provoking although this is an inaccurate adaptation of the original , it seems best to interpret this film on its own merit . those who have read the novel will find this difficult , but others are in for a treat . although somewhat shocking at first , this finely crafted film contains many nuances of political and social commentary that become more apparent on subsequent viewing . this film has aged well , given the current political climate and world events . here we see a vision of government founded on the politics of fear and openly contrived war set in a framework of wwii and cold war-styled propaganda . unfortunately , the parody is not as exaggerated as one might hope . visually , the film is spectacular . the score by basil pouledouris is itself worth the price of admission and is one of the best i have heard in three decades of collecting soundtracks . despite this recommendation , i should emphasize that this film is absolutely violent , with the stated aim of depicting the realities of war and is definitely not for the faint-hearted . an interesting aside , probably not well known outside australia , is that australian politician pauline hansen ( one nation ) ran a youth campaign directly modeled on the graphics and narration style of the federation propaganda web clips depicted in this film ; an hilarious blunder considering the controversy surrounding her campaign ( accusations of fascist leanings by her critics )
