in search of . . . eleven years old when his father , architect louis kahn , died in 1974 , filmmaker nathaniel kahn sets out in search of the man he hardly knew by visiting the sites of his architectural creations , from the salk institute in la jolla , california , to the capitol building of bangladesh . along the way , through interviews , old footage and photographs , much is revealed about this elusive , enigmatic , and often difficult man - including a closely guarded private life with children by three different women , while remaining married to only one of them . a personal film documenting the life and career of a public man , `` my architect '' is wonderfully engaging , leaving the viewer with a complexity of emotions as we listen to the comments of those who admired him , those who loved him , and those who did neither . especially revealing are the interviews with the two women , colleagues in his firm , who became romantically involved with him and years later still treasure the memory of him . an architect in bangladesh sums up the final image of a man whose work was inspired by a kind of mystical genius and who gave his love to mankind . moods mix and shift gracefully in the film from the discomfort of seeming to disagree with his mother 's reverent estimation of the man to the sweeping effects of time-lapse photography and a whimsical scene of rollerblading around the great courtyard of the salk institute . included in the dvd is an interesting and informative question and answer period between the filmmaker and a small theater audience , with additional scenes not used in the film .
