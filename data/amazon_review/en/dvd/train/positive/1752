clear , clean , concise if you have a swiss ball and you do n't have this dvd then you are not getting everything that you can out of your ball . this is an excellent training dvd if you want to maximize your fitness conditioning and increase your functional strength , suppleness , agility and coordination . the 3 training segments are each 20 minutes , not 10 minutes as another reviewer reported . the videography is excellent , clearly and simply showing each movement without any fancy fadeouts or quick switches . each phase is more challenging . i would say that the phase 1 section can be done by most people of average fitness after a couple of weeks of practice . however at first you may need your remote to pause the dvd until you acquire the skill to transition into and out of some of the more challening postions . let 's face it , if you are n't at an average fitness level then you should be doing a different overal kind of training , not focusing on abs . personally i am 56 years old and teach holistic nature workouts professionally . i have shared the training methods in this dvd with several people already and they have all benefited tremendously from them and are now including them in their workouts . have a ball
