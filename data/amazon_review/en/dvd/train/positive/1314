poorly extended 60 's film project tragic '' is a word that may become synonymous with the name of edie sedgwick . the 5 stars are for edie 's smile , and nothing more . this `` let 's start '' , and then `` stop '' , `` start again '' cycle of this film presents as a messy , disorganized glance at ms. sedgwick 's disturbing life . another 'tragedy `` exists here . our educated culture should recognize that if edie were n't exceptionally beautiful , there would n't have been much fuss over an ancestor of a historically noted family . beauty still takes precedence over most other attributes . it 's been over 35 years since the death of edie sedgwick , but the `` glam-famishished '' still wo n't let the beauty get her rest . the film 's black and white scenes show the brilliance of edie 's past beauty , but are all cut and pasted into a confusing , tangled decoupage . the additional color footage of the next decade is woven in carelessly . if it was just edie 's glowing wedding sequence that were included , it would 've been much easier to watch . the `` two teenagers '' who appear in the the colored segments seem out of time with edie 's glory days of the 60 's . this is not a spiraling masterpiece.not a work of art nor imagination galore . just commercial trash for the star struck . for other than commercial purposes , it is a film that spotlights it 's own defeat .
