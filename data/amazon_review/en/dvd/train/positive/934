i 've got issues with this dvd , but hey ... . i 'm giving this dvd four stars because the sound is good ; it 's excellent . i 'll overlook the fact there are times he 's singing , but the microphone ai n't quite there . it 's obvious marilyn manson puts on one hell of a show . this dvd is rockin ' , in that sense . just remember , teeenie boppers , it 's theatrics . alice cooper , iggy pop and others , in the late sixties and seventies , did this sh -- . manson ai n't nothin ' new . it ai n't like satananic theatrics are scary anymore . this dvd borders on a three star rating . it 's just that he does put on one hell of a show . marilyn just is n't all that and a bag of chips . his theatrics are good , but it 's hard to take a man , in a thong like s & m type outfit , seriously . oh , when he supposedly pisses on himself is just so ridiculous . i 'm sorry . smellin ' his butt with his fingers just gets comical . i still give it the four stars because i like his music , and this dvd sounds good . the editing takes numerous clips from numerous shows and combines them into one song . sure it 's well done , but it ticks me off when bands do this . bad religion did it ; but , my lord , how much money does this band have and they release this kind of dvd ? it annoys me . i probably should give this dvd three stars , but it does rock . you just have to get over the fact marilyn looks like an idiot . he lacks that toughness to pull off the look , if that 's possible . if he walked into a bar lookin ' like he did with the thong leather pantie crap , a woman would kick his butt ... you can reference a guns 'n ' roses review of mine , i believe even axyl rose , in his cute little shorts , could kick marilyn 's butt ... i know that was n't politically correct , but it 's true ... screw it , i should give it three stars , but the show is flippin ' fun..
