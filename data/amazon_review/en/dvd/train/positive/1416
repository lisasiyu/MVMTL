disdisgutingly gory to to be totally honest , i only saw this movie once . it was in 1974 when i was 12 years old . yes , we snuck into the theatre . i remember the warnings at the time. `` completely concerned with disgusting gory violence '' those warnings were very true . this movie is not for those with queasy stomachs for there are a number of scenes which could make the average person puke . that is providing they are not edited out for this upcoming release . one being where baron frankenstein says , `` to know life , one must f ... the gallbladder '' which he does after cutting open the female frankenstein monster . the lopping off of a head with curved shears was a good one too . the fact that this movie was originally in 3d made for some good close ups of intestines and livers as well . too bad the dvd will not be in 3d . as with most classic horrors , the acting is not deserving of any awards , but i believe that any collector of horror/gore flicks should cosider this movie
