you can get lost in this bio-pic you can immediately feel that you are a part of history and even when you know their ( frida kahlo , diego rivera ) story you still get surprised amused and amazed . i have seen their actual work and this film brings it back . for people that do not know their story this is an excellent introduction . i found it interesting how frida ( selma hayek ) and diego ( alfred molina ) complimented each others personality so well from the beginning until where we leave them . also the films surrealistic qualities will remind you of `` water for chocolate '' . many times this enhances instead of distracting form the reality of the films port ate . the colors being vibrant and even the music being vibrant fives a three dimensional quality to the film . i have only seen one other julie taymor directed film `` oedipus rex '' ( 1992 ) which also had this quality . julie seems to know how to bring out thoughts that we do not know we have our selves and we see many things in a new way . i started to buy the soundtrack but do not see lila downs on any of the tracks . and her singing was the soul of the movie . now it is time to read the hayden herrera ( book ) `` frida - a biography of frida kahlo '' to see how much is in this screen adaptation by clancy sigal .
