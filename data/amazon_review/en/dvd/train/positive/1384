a great gift to all who loved the man to really get an artist 's personality , sometimes you need to see them live . i do n't know if that 's true with johnny but i know it sure does n't hurt . this is a very young johnny with luther and marshal . three friends , lots of fans , and a set of songs that you 'll probably recognize from his few albums that were out at that time . yes , there are several repeat performances but nothing really overshadows the fact that you get to see this piece of music history . it does n't take any of the shine off it is what i 'm saying . complete with some teasing onstage banter and a one or two minute bout of outright goofyness as johnny imitates an anonymous singer ... if you ca n't figure out that it 's elvis he 's impersonating ... than you do n't know elvis and you were born in a cave . this is not a rock and roll show by any means . it 's perfect and original country concert and what a collectors item . a real treasure . glad i got a hold of a copy . no problems with audio or visual quality . for the time period , having to turn the volume up a little extra is not an issue [ for me atleast ] . enjoy
