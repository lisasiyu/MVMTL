good good film it 's not a movie for those who hate to see sex on screen and this is certainly not porn but art to the highest degree , scenes of actual penetration and oral sex are such that they seem to draw you into the artist lear that is ken park . the plot is solid enough without being staid , the acting is good . i found this absolutely easy to watch simply because this is reality ... .reality onscreen for once ... passion is here , sex is hear , nudity is hear ... trust and love is here for all to see . this is film making as it should be ; giving the view a film where they have to see it a few times to come to grips with it 's sheer uniqueness . i recommend this .
