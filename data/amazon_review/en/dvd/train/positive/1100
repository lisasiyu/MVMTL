room 101 revisited after expecting `` the english patient , part vi '' we were pleasantly surprised to see ralph fiennes head off into uncharted waters . a dark blend of `` nineteen eighty-four '' and `` brazil '' emerges in a fully-formed recreation of the stalinist revolutionary state , with subreferences to practically every dictator who graced the twentieth century . donald sutherland has a chance to shine in a fabulous castro-esque ( the early years ) beard , and we were also highly impressed with lara flynn boyle , and tom hollander as the son-turned-heir , an unfortunate dictatorial truth still being played out in north korea . mr. hollander was suitably portrayed as a short man next to the leggy boyle , and the 1950s peronist costumes set an appropriate tone . draw whatever conclusions you will from the film 's final scenes- they are the results of torture and re-education camps- but many russian , cuban , argentinian , north korean , chinese , afghani , italian , cambodian , george orwellian dissidents would agree that `` land of the blind '' is a superbly accurate and ironic piece of work .
