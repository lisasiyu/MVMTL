this is my favorite of the muppet movies ! i like the muppet movies and my favorite is the muppets take manhattan which i found to be cute and funny . i originally had this movie on video , the pan and scan video tape and i also had the video tapes for the other muppet movies but i gave them to my little cousins and then i bought the widescreen dvd for the the muppets take manhattan and i coould n't be happier with the dvd and now i just have to buy the dvd , s for the muppet movie and the great muppet caper and the new dvd 's for muppet treasure island and the muppets christmas carol . btw : i did n't buy my muppets take manhattan dvd from amazon . i bought it in walmart for 5 dollars
