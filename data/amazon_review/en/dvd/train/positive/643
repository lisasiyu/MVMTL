enjoyed it i actually liked this movie and i do n't understand the bad reviews maybe they were expecting a smarter movie i do n't know . anyways the plot was easy to follow and made some sense and the action was okay . i am not going into the movies detail because i do n't want to ruin the story for somebody . i will recommend this movie to people and most will enjoy it but those crazy people that like perfect movies and complain about every detail will not enjoy it all . rent it then maybe buy it if you like it
