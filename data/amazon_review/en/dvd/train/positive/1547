a good film from a great man was it worth the attention ? definitely . was it worth the money ? absolutely . was it worth the effort ? certainly . was it worth two years ? probably . was it worth the wait ? not really . does it deserve to be the last effort of the great late director ? unquestionably . as the plot of eyes wide shut unfolds , tom cruise and nicole kidman struggle to attract the audience 's attention . they attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world , in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream . as good of an actor as tom cruise is in this movie , nicole kidman manages to steal the show from him . the scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything : him , her daughter , and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed to die for and the broadway play blue room . the only flawed scene for kidman as alice , an ex-gallery manager , who is currently unemployed , is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare . her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance . the famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar . it captures the viewer attention , but is it really needed ? that scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life . the entire scenery inside the rich mansion , where the orgy scenes take place , where the masked men pray on hookers , is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity . stanley kubrick , a master of filmmaking , gives an imaginary twist to marriage , dreams , and reality of life . but once the viewer exits the theater , he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears . such effect is indeed kubrick 's last legacy .
