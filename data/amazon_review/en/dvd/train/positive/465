enjoyable i utilize this tape on those days that are n't scheduled `` off '' days but on which i really have a hard time gathering the oomph for my usual high intensity workouts . i do break a sweat , but i have dance experience and can embellish moves as needed . in general , i love dance but despise dance workouts , ( boring and often annoying ) , but this instructor is genuine and her choices and pacing are appropriate . further , she breaks the video down into mini-routines , so if you wanted to , you could memorize the routines and mix and match them to your own music , ( she provides counts - mostly 8 but some 4 & 16 - throughout the video ) . the background dancers have typical bodies rather than being ridiculously skinny with huge boobs , which is a nice change . finally , if you do not emphasize your core and hip movements , this workout will be much less effective , so if you have n't danced before and are n't used to posture and breathing , keep in mind that you will need to focus on using these muscles , or your moves will be too sloppy to provide a workout
