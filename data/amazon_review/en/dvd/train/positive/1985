better than expected after reading some of the more negative reviews , i thought that this movie would be a dud , but it was not . i found it to be interesting , although a bit predictable . as a historical drama it brings to light a story of which many may be unaware - the murder of a low level movie producer by a publishing magnate . good plot , good acting , good story telling and plausible ending make this movie enjoyable
