great series lucille ball 's second tv show `` the lucy show '' does n't seem to come close to her first , the extremely popular `` i love lucy '' , in amount of reruns syndicated on television . this is a shame since the quality of the two shows are very similar . in the series , lucy stars as lucy carmichael , a zany secretary working in a hollywood bank for her stodgy boss , mr. mooney . lucy 's less-than-efficient secretarial skills and wacky hijacks frequently infuriate her boss , but somehow she is loyal to him not matter what . the five episodes included in this dvd feature some famous guest stars including carol burnette ( playing lucy 's librarian roommate carol ) , and john wayne , milton berle , ruta lee , and george burns . like in `` i love lucy '' , lucille 's character fawning over the movie stars is very amusing and even though the series was made a decade after `` i love lucy '' , she still does much of her physical comedy pretty well . the picture quality of the episodes is not the best and the menu navigation for the dvd is somewhat confusing , but those problems are not bad enough to distract from the shows . while its not quite as good as lucy 's first show , it 's still a great show and worth a look if you enjoy `` i love lucy '' or lucille ball
