you could numb your brain thinking about the paradoxes , but an excellent film i would love to discuss the paradoxes in this movie but that would give away too much of the plot for those who have not seen it , which should be the reason your reading this review . any story dealing with time travel will have them , it is unavoidable . think of the `` grandfather paradox '' . if you were to travel back in time and kill your grandfather , you would never exist . if you never existed , you could not travel back in time to kill your grandfather . so for purpose of this movie you must suspend your disbelief . the plot of this movie is brilliantly cohesive , as it can be . it just requires a lot of thinking . this film is beautifully shot , has great acting , and a great story . i definitely recommend this one .
