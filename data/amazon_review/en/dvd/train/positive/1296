boiler room may boil your nerves some folks might rent or buy this dvd for its well known names , but vin disel and ben afflec play very small roles it is giovanni ribsi that shines . he plays a young college drop out , who turns to an in-house , illegal gambling den to help him release his inner rage and built up anxieties towards his demanding father . ( spoilers ) but it is his discovery of a boiler room operation hawking non-existent stocks and bonds for non-existent companies that really steers this movie . fantastic interactions between the main character , and vin disel character . i appreciated the relationship beteen giovanni and the secretary character , but i felt it was under-developed and weak . could have been left out , or developed better . i saw this one in the theater , and now own on dvd , and would recommend it to any pre-mba student , or wall street wannabe . it is great training . mc white said : check it out !
