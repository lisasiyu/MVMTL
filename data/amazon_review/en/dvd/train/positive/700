a must have ! ! we love this whole series of dvd 's . our 13 month-old son never watches tv at home , but on long car trips , these are life savers ! the music is beautiful and soothing and the images are great . he loves the `` real '' pictures of children , animals , and nature scenes . we received the `` god of wonders '' as a gift , and have since purchased the other two . these are a great alternative to the einstein videos if you want christian music along with the videos
