the long-forgotten misunderstood chevy chase movie when i was 12 this movie was a staple on the then still-blossoming hbo . i think i 've watched it or seen bits and pieces of it like more than thirty times . as a kid there were a lot of things i did n't get , of course , but it was funny to me . now , that was 1982 . twenty-three years later i saw it on amazon and nostalgia just washed over me . i had to have it . finally , i thought , modern problems and foul play have been released to dvd , two childhood staples ... i watched both movies . modern problems was as i remembered it , mostly . i get all the jokes and situations now that i 'm an adult , of course , but there were some other things i got as well . this is n't the happy-go-lucky chevy chase that we all remember from cassyshack and seems like old times , this is the darker side . modern porblems has its share of ridiculousness , but beneath the surface , this is a pretty dark comedy . when chevy uses his telekinetic powers to make his ex-girlfriend 's date 's nose start bleeding , jesus it is hysterical , but at the same time ... when you have a chance to think about it ... quite grim . there is an underlying 'life sucks ' theme going on here which was where the world was in 1981 and i think this movie captures that pretty well . is this my favorite chevy chase movie ? no . fletch and vacation and christmas vacation and caddyshack are . there 's been a lot of others , too . is this a classic ? i 'd say , yes . here is 1981 all rolled up and categorized in a comedy by the reigning star of the time . a little slice of regan-era fatalism . enjoy
