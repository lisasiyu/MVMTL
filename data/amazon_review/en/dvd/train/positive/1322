gore and humor at the opera . dario argento 's terror at the opera is simply about a psychotic hooded killer who terrorizes an opera diva whom he adores . the opera diva is betty , a young singer who gets a chance to star in macbeth when the original lead has an accident and breaks her leg . her powerful ( not ) performances in macbeth attracts the killer who randomly kidnaps betty , ties her up and tapes a row of sharp pins under her eyes forcing her to watch him commit murder . later on in the film we find out why he does this to her aswell as the killers secret identity . terror at the opera is more of a slasher rather than a horror , ( as there is no real scary moments in the entire film ) but still a good horror . tato is a very enjoyable horror/slasher . for the usual horror fanatic , it does deliver as it is gory and strangely at times very humorous . the camera work is great in this film as it exaggerates the gore by simply zooming in on a penetration of a knife or when the camera becomes the eyes of betty , showing us what she sees through those sharp needles taped under her eyes . apart from gore , tato also has a mystery factor . as the film progresses introducing new characters and reminding us of old suspicious characters , the viewer soon begins to wonder who is the killer . and of course this does lead to a twist at the end . with plenty of violence , mystery , thrills and humor , dario argento 's well paced feature will not dissapoint . one bad thing i can say about this film is that the acting is quite bad , but that maybe the result of the terrible dubbing . however , terror at the opera is still an entertaining film and well worth a look
