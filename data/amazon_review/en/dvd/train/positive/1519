will film critics stop praising how glorious tarantino is ! ! ! yes , this movie is awe-inspiring , awesome ( i 'm running out of adjectives here , lol ) but will certain film critics ( roger ebert i hope you read this ) stop going around and saying how everything with dark humor , odd narrative , talky dialogue , etc. , is tarantino-esque ? ? without godard writing the blueprint on how to be a film essayist , there would n't be a tarantino-esque ( qt also owes a lot to elmore leonard , scorsese , depalma , and blaxploitation. ) . if i read one more review from overrated critic ebert about how tarantino paved the way for filmmakers that have a godardian bite to their films , i might kill myself , lol he never says how great of an influence godard had on tarantino . nor does any other critics say how godard 's `` breathless '' created modern cinema . its as though these critics totally ignored godard 's methods , and pretend geeks like tarantino created them . shame on you ebert . that 's like saying christina aguilera created that soulful yet high-scale histeronic singing she does , when whitney houston and mariah carey did it before her . give people the credit they deserve
