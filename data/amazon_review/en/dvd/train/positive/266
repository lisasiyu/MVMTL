10 stars ! i ca n't say enough good things about this movie . i watch a lot of anime , but i have to say this is the most well animated movie i 've seen . you completely forget you 're watching a cartoon . the characters just come to life . all of their subtle movements make them seem like real people . especially hana the transvestite . she was animated with so much attention to detail . it 's so incredible ! and then there 's the story . three homeless people find an abandoned baby and go out searching for the mother . these characters show so much heart and you really find yourself caring for them . and each of their situations for why they 're homeless are all so real . so then they find the mother and then there 's a huge twist in the story which i wont give away . i 'll just say the ending is a miracle . fantastic movie
