first season and still the best the first season of seaview was the best and season 1 , volume 2 has some of the series best episodes . mutiny , doomsday , the invaders , the indestructible man , the buccaneer , the human computer , the saboteur , cradle of the deep , and the enemies are top-notch . i 've always loved seaview 's incredible monsters and mutiny 's giant jellyfish is a sight to behold . the threat of nuclear war is realistically portrayed in doomsday . i still get shivers up and down my spine when robert duvall opens his eyes in the invaders and when the robot stalks patterson and kowalski in the indestructible man . only seaview would have an episode about someone bold enough to steal the mona lisa . this story ( the buccaneer ) works because the villian is believable ( a touch gay by today 's standards but that 's why the story works ) and the relationships between the crew members are emphasized . in the human computer , seaview is controlled by a computer that 's supposed to replace the crew . star trek did a similar story but seaview 's is better because only crane and an enemy agent are on board and the sight of these 2 men stalking each other on the deserted sub have great impact . by far the best episode for me is the enemies . with it 's crazy cold war politics , crane and nelson against the bad guys , and that wonderful room where people on one side seem gigantic compared to those on the other side , how could this episode miss . as always , the special effects , the black and white photography , and paul sawtell 's wonderful theme make seaview one old series that 's worth visiting over and over again
