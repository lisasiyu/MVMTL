the truth will set you free a wonderful movie about a boy whose family are coal miners in ireland . this young boy wants to dance instead of following him father and brother into the coal mines . he rises above the ridicule of him family and friends and finds a mentor who helps him fulfill his dreams . what i love so much about this story is that one realizes you do n't have to follow the norm in order to be happy and succeed . what we need to do is follow our hearts . i loved this movie and i believe you will too
