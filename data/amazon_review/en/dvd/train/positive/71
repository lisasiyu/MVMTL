an 80 's classic i love this movie ! ! i remember the first time i saw it , i was about 6-7 yrs.old , on a plane & on my way to puerto rico . eighteen ( or so ) years later , i bought it & watched it with my family , it brought back so many great memories , we loved it all over again . i love the music , the dancing & the actors/actresses , the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is an 80 's movie ! we all know how 80 's dance movies have the bad fame of neing corny ! i have to admit , it did have some corny and bad acting moments , but all in all , i think this is an amewome movie , i love it & recommend it
