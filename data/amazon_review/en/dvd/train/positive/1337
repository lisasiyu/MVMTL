excellent in almost every way i am a relative newcomer to the world of adam dalgliesh , both in print and in film . i had read both this novel and a predecessor , 'a certain justice , ' and came across this film as it was presented over a two-night episode of pbs 'mystery ! . ' i am , as it bears mentioning , completely unfamiliar with the work of roy marsden in this role , and so approach this presentation with relatively fresh eyes . ( although , i doubt i would have enjoyed his performance having been completely captivated by 'the sandbaggers . ' ) shaw 's presentation of dalgliesh is understated , and most definitely contemplative . those looking for melodrama will be deeply disappointed . the film retains all the essential elements of the novel , and most of the subtext usually lost in novel to film translations is pleasantly preserved in this rendition . certain motivations of the secondary characters are truncated , but this is a necessary convention of the form , and is not done capriciously or in disservice to the overall narrative . my only complaint is the presentation of the actual physical church building . given its importance in the overall story , more effort could have been made to create a more imposing , reverant , and solemn atmosphere of this crucial location . as this is but a minor quibble , i hardily recommend this production , and give it four stars
