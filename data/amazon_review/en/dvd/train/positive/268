like it even better on dvd to be honest , i loved the japanese original of this movie so much that my first watching of the american version was a little tainted . but i just watched the richard gere version again , this time on dvd , and found that i really like it more than i realized . gere is so winsome ( i 'll pay to watch him dance any day , he is aging gorgeously ! ) , and lopez so elegant , and all the other characters so interesting , and the music so sexy , why quibble over which movie is better ? this story is entertaining and touching in its own right , even if not as nuanced and heartfelt as the japaese version . i have watched ballroom dancing competitions for years , and this film conveys the romance and excitement that draws people to those competitions . the story is charming , adult and pg with a satisfying ending -- how rare is that combination these days ? the dvd offers good insights into the ballroom training and hard work behind the movie , as well as a wonderful `` sway '' music video . which reminds me -- the soundtrack is excellent , and i bought that , too .
