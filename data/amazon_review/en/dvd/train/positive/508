it 's fun quentin tarrantino promised us a `` horror film for horror fans . '' he lied . it 's not scary , it 's not suspenseful , but it is a fun movie . i got ta say , the first half is really , really good , but it gets a little lame when the vampires show up , but it 's still one of those movies you can watch over and over .
