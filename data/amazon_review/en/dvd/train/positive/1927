gumboostic ! ! ! ! i bought this dvd sometime ago , but forgot about it until i discovered it just sitting there among my dvd collection . i watched it and bwoy ! was i taken away or what ? being originally from southern africa brought back many memories as we used to grow up listening and mimicking gumboot dancing . this is a must-see dvd and the dancing , choreography and music has been excently put together to bring this explosion of energy and power ! makes you feel like you are actually there ...
