blockbuster ! ! this film is the best review on record of what happened in 1967 . the reviews that denigrate it do n't answer the charges , they just distract . the facts and the evidence show that israel attacked a u.s. ship in international waters and tried to sink it , for whatever motive . some feel that it might have been because israel , our `` gallant little ally '' , was executing pow 's because they did n't have the logistics to care for them . others feel it that they were going to sink the ship and blame it on egypt , thereby drawing us into the conflict directly on israel 's side of course . ( where have we seen this before ? ) the detractors ca n't deal with the facts and this film proves israel is a murdering , traitorous , backstabbing nation whose only alligiance is to themselves .
