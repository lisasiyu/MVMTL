great summary of corporate crime because the enron scandal has become one of the biggest securities frauds in american history , this documentary sums up - in a nice little package - how organized and white-collar crimes are costly to society in both human and financial terms . more importantly , this documentary shows how the american criminal justice system responds to criminal careers of corporations . as a result of the aforementioned , i use this audio-visual as a teaching tool in my criminology class and highly recommend it to professors and students alike .
