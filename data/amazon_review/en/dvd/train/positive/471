clever as ever ( almost ) if you 've viewed season one , and liked it ( and you must have-otherwise why would you even consider buying season 2 ) you will enjoy this second dvd . though the first season was [ to me ] much more interesting and action packed , probably because it was new and a fresh idea , this season 's storylines continue to make surprise twists and turns . just to watch eva longoria 's and marcia cross 's characters get what they want , one way or another makes this a worthy purchase . not a learning experience , but excellent mindless entertainment ! !
