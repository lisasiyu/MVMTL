not so complete this dvd is a reworking of a tv series from the mid-90s that was released on vhs as `` jacques pepin 's cooking techniques '' . unfortunately , not everything from the original series has been included on the dvd . as stated by other reviewers the presentation format in the dvd is also combersome , with most segments lasting less than five minutes and then returning to the menu . it would have made a much better product and been less disjointed if they just released on dvd the original series as originally made . also the dvd features a couple of segements from jacques ' early 90s series `` today 's gourmet '' . it would be great if kqed would release these on dvd also . nevertheless , the dvd does present the basic and most common techniques used in the kitchen , and is useful for anyone who wants to improve their skills as a cook .
