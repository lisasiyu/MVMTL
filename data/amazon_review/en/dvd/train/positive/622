the capriciousness of life rarely has a film drawn me in so deeply that i remain affected days after i viewed it . `` the son 's room '' is profound in its ability to create its moods especially in the latter half of the film . i feel that the director 's presentation of this happy family , in the film 's first half , is what allowed me to feel the result of an impending tragedy so personally . i kept thinking that i wanted everything to go back to the way it was before . i shared their grief as if it was my own . i also applaud the presentation of an italian society which is unlike the comic opera italian experience presented in american films over the past decades going back to the silent era . the film may not affect you as deeply as it affected me , but i highly recommend the absorbing story that is presented .
