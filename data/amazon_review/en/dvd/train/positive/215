an unforgettable experience most of you guys for sure remember that day on july 1985 when suddenly you turned on the tv and dozens of bands played all day long their best songs for a noble and humanitarian reason . when you buy this cd remember that you are helping to save human lives in africa , and that is worth much more than the wonderful songs that you will listen here . the best performance of all ? probably mick jagger 's give me just another night , the cars ' heartbeat city , david bowie 's heroes , queen we are the champions , u2 's ( birth to the world ) bad , tom pettys ' refugee or duran duran with hall & oates
