thrills and romance when i first began watching this movie i thought what is going on all these lights and cars chasing each other but after i got past that i thought it was a wonderful movie . melanie was ok and rachel was amazing but hugh dancy was the most amazing one of all . i never expected to see him that way and to see that shower seen well ... ... i 'll let every one see it for themselves . i think this movie was really great and who ever does n't think so should watch it again because maybe they fell asleep or some thing because this movie was great
