laughter is what the `` magic '' in this classic english farce is this movie perfect ? far from it , but this is part of its charm . none of the reviews i have read thus far have included the priceless , utterly hillarious scene enacted by the superb sir laurence harvey performing the `` to be , or not to be '' soliloquy from hamlet in front of a stodgy uppercrust theater audience while performing a striptease ! the final shot of his codpiece being tossed out into the audience is worth the price of the movie alone .
