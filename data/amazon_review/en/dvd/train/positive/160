this is an artful piece of direction . i 'm not very familiar with the books of daniel handler ( lemony snicket ) but , even by judging this film alone , i 'm going to say that his work appeals to me a lot more than harry potter . the kids enjoyed it a lot and after watching it they wanted a second round . the story centers on three adorable and gifted children who 're abruptly orphaned when their parents die in a mysterious fire . their search for a new home and well-meaning new guardians is constantly interfered by the malicious count orlaf ( jim carrey ) who hunts after the bauedelaires ' family fortune . the main reason why this film is so genuinely unsettling is because the story relentlessly uncovers the deepest fear of every child , namely the death of parents and the large risk of ending up with ill-natured new guardians . most fairy-tale do n't even dare to bring up this nightmarish idea , but `` lemony snicket ... '' entirely revolves around it . equally effective are , of course , the ghoulish landscapes , the dark scenery and the amazingly eccentric characters . most of the time , it feels like you 're watching a typical tim burton film and that 's a giant compliment , since his style is practically unique ( sinister , witty and heart-warming all at once ! ) . there 's a lot of cgi here but not to the point to annoy you , since all these exaggeratedly fake special effects ( the leeches , aunt josephine 's seaside-house ) contribute to the morbid atmosphere . the cast is terrific as well , with jim carrey as count orlaf in one most memorable performance to date . i have to admit i initially feared that carrey 's performance would be far over-the-top , but he 's surprisingly mature and convincing . the bauedelaire-children are very well cast as well and so are billy connolly and meryl streep in the most important supportive roles . the great cast is completed with respectable names ( luiz guzmï¿½n , catherine o'hara , jennifer coolidge , cedric the entertainer ... ) in small roles . sublime film . it 's funny , it 's interesting , it 's creative ! i recommend taking a chance on this one- if you like art , if you like jim carrey , and if you like unique plots , highly recommended for all type of audiences !
