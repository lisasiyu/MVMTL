watch it with gettysburg i 'm not a civil war expert , but having recently visited fredericksburg , chancellorsville , and gettysburg , i paid very close attention to the history told me by the guides as well as the books i read . when i came home i watched both gettysburg and gods and generals again , and i must say , the events of these important battles come to life in these dvds . yes , there 's always going to be some interpretation done , but overall i thought the acting was well done and the information reliable . the characters were well developed , as i felt that i got a chance to really know what these men were like . if you want to see history , then i would recommend this and gettysburg as well
