buy this dvd/cd it is worth it this dvd/cd combo is a very worthy effort by coheed and cambria . it includes all of their hit songs and they are a joy to watch live . the only bad thing about this package is that the audio on the dvd is sub-par . this doesnt mean that it is bad , it just isnt the kind of quality i would expect from a big time band like coheed and cambria . even though the audio isnt that great , i still watch the thing all the time . the best part of this package is the cd that comes along with it . this is worth buying this product alone . i suggest putting the cd on full blast and watching the dvd on mute . all in all i give the dvd 3 out of 5 and the cd 5 out of 5 which averages out to a decent 4 . this should hold anyone that needs a coheed fix until they put out their next c
