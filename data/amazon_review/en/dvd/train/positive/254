new transfer on the vip edition everyone here seems to want to chime in their own commentary on the film 's content , so i 'm only going to bring up the only thing that matters -- how does this new transfer measure up ? the new anamorphic widescreen transfer alone makes upgrading to this edition a no-brainer . if you are trying to decide weather to get this hopped-up edition ( vip ) , or the old version , this is the one to get . who cares about all the junk in the box , i gave mine all away , i just wanted the new version of the movie . as of this writing , the vip edition is only way to get the anamorphic version . the older , original issue of this film is non-amamorphic and will not be suitable if you have a widescreen or a 4:3 hdtv with 16x9 enhancement ( unless you want use the `` zoom '' effect ) .
