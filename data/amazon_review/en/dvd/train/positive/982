if you enjoyed `` ju-on : the grudge '' . . . . . . then this film may be for you ! like `` ju-on : the grudge , '' `` ju-on 2 '' presents a series of interconnected vignettes . though the non-linear presentation can sometimes confuse the viewer , it takes only a moment to realize the correlation between the last portrait and the next . so , be patient ; ) this film has a bit of a postmodern spin ( which many horror-film scholars may enjoy ) . one of the main characters , kyoko harase , plays an actress known as `` the queen of horror . '' she is taken to the infamous saeki home to give a television interview about her own experience as a horror actress . it is there that she is marked with the curse ( in a fairly unpredictable way ! ! ) and , there that true horror enters her own life . to the joy of many viewers , toshio figures prominently into `` ju-on 2 . '' though the make-up on toshio is a little flat ( unlike `` ju-on the grudge '' ) his acting is still pitch-perfect . nonetheless , it is interesting to note that yuya ozeki ( who play toshio saeki ) did not understand the part he was playing in earlier films ( simply as a result of his tender age ) . he has now refused to watch his own films and his parents go to the premieres alone : ) ( you can discover this information on the american version of `` the grudge '' in takashi shimizu 's commentary ) . some reviewers seem hyper-critical of this work . yes , the film has some missteps , but they are easily overlooked . if you watched and enjoyed `` ju-on : the grudge '' then try `` ju-on 2 '' . . . you might be pleasantly surprised !
