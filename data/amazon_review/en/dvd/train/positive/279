hands down , the most realistic wwi combat film to date ! all i can say is wow ! this is ricky schroeder ? no way ! rick does an unbelievable job in this movie and proves himself to be a true actor worthy of extreme praise . the story line is excellent and true to the actual event the movie is based upon . they spent the time and got all the details right on this one , the historical accuracy is extremely impressive . this is not a `` chick flick '' as it has a lot of intense close quarter combat , which is not the case with many modern wwii films . that makes some parts of the movie a bit graphic and nasty , but wwi was graphic and nasty . the hand-held camera work is a bit jumpy and almost too over-the-top in trying to place you `` into '' the action at times , but the movie is certainly good enough to overcome the overzealous camera work . if you want to know something of wwi combat , there 's not a better movie out there right now - at least that i know of . with all due respect to `` all quiet on the western front '' of course - both versions . the lost batallion should be in any military enthusiast 's collection .
