a wonderfully ridiculous bit of fun this is a very delightful bit of silliness . do you remember how visually wonderful `` chicken run '' was ? well , this is even better . wallace is a daft inventor who , in this story , is running a humane pest removal service named `` anti-pesto '' and gromit is his intelligent and loyal dog . gromit is the one with the common sense and is the only one in the whole film who seems to know what is going on . and gromit never says a word . however , he is quite expressive and we always know clearly what is on his mind and why he has the concerns he has . the town is concerned about the rabbits eating their vegetable gardens because the annual giant vegetable growing contest is about to be held . the sponsor is a local hereditary heir , lady tottington ( wonderfully voiced by helena bonham carter ) . she is being courted by the scoundrel victor quatermaine ( voice amazingly by ralph fiennes ) . he also loves to shoot rabbits , but this bothers her ladyship and once she meets wallace she becomes more taken with him and his humane ways . wallace comes up with the idea of trying to condition the rabbits to not want to eat the vegetables and things have to be stopped before the process is completed . the rest of the movie is working out all the crazy details of the unexpected results of the partial experiment . lots of fun and quite a visual treat and a stop-action / animation triumph . enjoy
