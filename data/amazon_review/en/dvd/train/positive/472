good workout but ... i used the tape about 4 days a week and i really saw a difference in my body , especially my arms . i only did the toning portion . i felt silly doing the dance portion and i really do n't care for the music . other than that , i recommend this video for toning . i have also tried `` optimizer '' and `` strength and grace '' which are also very good and there is no dancing .
