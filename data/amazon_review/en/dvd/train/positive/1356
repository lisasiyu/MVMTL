way to go willie worsley saw the movie and it was great , especially since i grew up knowing willie worsley ( and mr.worsley , if you are reading this , i still hate basketball ! ! ) ... but it was a great movie depicting more than just the success of the team , it was a success for the times . mr. worsley continued to break grounds , and his love and devotion to the welfare and success of many youths , to this day , is a testament to his lifelong vocation , that of a true mentor , father figure , leader and friend
