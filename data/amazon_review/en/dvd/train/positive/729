relive childhood memories wwe produces good quality documentary dvds ( i ca n't always say the same about their raunchy live shows ) . this is another well-made , interesting , and entertaining wwe dvd . it brought back lots of memories for me . a lot of the 80s gimmicks seem corny and overly tame by today 's standards , but they seemed pretty dumb to me at the time , too , and i was just a kid . one sort of sad thing is to see bobby heenan 's commentary . he does n't sound or look anything like he used to . he appears gaunt and withdrawn and slurs his words . he says with a touch of sadness in his voice that he misses the days of going out there and entertaining the fans ( realizing , i 'm sure , that he will never again be a personality on any wrestling programming )
