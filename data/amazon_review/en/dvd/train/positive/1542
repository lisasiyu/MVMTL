not his best , but still very , very good ! yeah , ok , the drummer is way off , his timing sucks and he looks alternatively sick , angry or distracted . maybe he was sick that day . but we have to remember that it is a live performance with all the screw-ups that come with it . betts is still a master guitarist and band leader . my only question is why is the sound on the cd so much fuller and better than on the dvd ? they were recorded at the same show ! i have to also highly recommend the 3 cd instant live set , recorded with this same band
