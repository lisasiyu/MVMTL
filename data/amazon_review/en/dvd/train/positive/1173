korda classic . sabu appears to be having a very good time as mowgli , the child adopted by wolves who lives among the wild beasts as one of them ; he swings from tree to tree like a nursery tarzan . in the dark-green jungles of this lush , handsome alexander korda production ( directed by zoltan korda ) mowgli has more to do with humans than in the original kipling novel . patricia o'rourke is around for a suggestion of precocious romance ; also joseph calleia is there for posterity ... the screenplay by laurence stallings perhaps wandered a bit from kipling , the segments concerning the python , the treasure and the ruined city are still thrilling in their way . children will probably still love the movie , and adults will have a better time than they expected ... look for a very young , very american rosemary decamp
