a bit formulaic , but excellent for shakespeare classes shakespeare 's _hamlet_ is the real star of the comedy _renaissance man_ . many films have featured groups of social misfits who have grown and changed through the assistance of a caring teacher , but in how many of those films has the teacher been dead for almost 400 years ? danny devito is funny in this family-friendly film , but it is the bard himself who shines best here . i use this film in my college-level shakespeare courses and find that it is more useful for teaching shakespeare to young adults than most of the recent film adaptations aimed at the younger generation ( _she 's the man_ and _10 things i hate about you_ come to mind ) . _renaissance man_ celebrates the magic of shakespeare that even recent films preserving shakespeare 's language , such as the _hamlet_ starring ethan hawke , do not . in _renaissance man_ , shakespeare 's beautiful language is not replaced . rather , it is read and then internalized by the characters who produce their own modernized version in the form of a rap song and chant . the film teaches about some of shakespeare 's rhetorical strategies ( e.g. , metaphor , oxymoron ) as well as his themes ( e.g. , mutability ) . while the recitation of henry the fifth 's famous `` crispin day '' speech at the end of the film is a little sappy , the characters ' reaction to and obvious enjoyment of the _henry v_ stage production is not . the characters in _renaissance man_ model for the young people of today how shakespeare should be experienced .
