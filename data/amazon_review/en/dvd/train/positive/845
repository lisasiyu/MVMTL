a `` cross '' to bare this is one of the most beautiful films i 've ever seen . everything about this film says `` beauty '' . from the beautiful storyline to beautiful scenery this film tugs at your heartstrings . mary steenburgen is perfect ( and yes beautiful ! ) as marjorie rawlings who seeks to discover her true calling in the florida backwoods . the music is ... .well beautiful . i wish a soundtrack was available for this film , as i would buy it in a second . by the way , this film received a 5 minute standing ovation at sundance . why ? because it delivers the goods . if you are looking for a film to `` fill your heart '' , you found it . watch and enjoy . i hope i run into mary steenburgen one day ( quite possible here in l.a. ) as i want to tell her how great and beautiful she was in this film ( it 's important that she know ! ! ! )
