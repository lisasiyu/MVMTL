displaced from ny/nj growing up as a kid in the ny metro area , march of the wooden soldiers was always on wpix channel 11 every thanksgiving . it had become a tradition in the family to watch it every year . after being transferred to maryland , i have been unable to find it on any station ( all 385 on cable ) . this version has both the colorized and the orignal black & white version on the disc . it is wonderful ! ! worth every penny for the memories and to keep the tradition alive with my children
