under-rated ... intriguing movie with as many layers as an onion . there is also a surprising , rare commentary by star val kilmer ( one of the most under rated actors of the day ) in which he alternately teases and admires with warmth , director david mamet ( `` dav-eed mam-ay '' ) , as well as the black ops/rangers-types he plays in spartan . best to go into the film unspoiled and be surprised , several times over . for anyone who loves espionage with a twist , this one wo n't disappoint
