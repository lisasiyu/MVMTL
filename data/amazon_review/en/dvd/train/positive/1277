a wild & creepy sleeper ! stuart gordons `` dagon '' is a unique horror gem that belongs in every true horror fans collection ! while not as well known as re-animator this film adaptation of another h.p.lovecraft nightmare is one of the very best out there . this one is truly what nightmares are made of & i for one enjoyed the hell out of it . excellent horror film !
