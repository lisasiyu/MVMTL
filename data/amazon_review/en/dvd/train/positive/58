great instruction , great program , great fun this program is simply the best kid 's program i 've ever seen . i really ca n't say a lot that has n't already been said in other reviews , i just wanted to also voice my opinion as to how terrific this program is . - a couple of quick points that make this program so special are ; the instructor , the program itself , and the amount of fun the kids on the program are having , and the amount of fun my children have doing the program . - the instructor has a great time interacting with the kids on the program , and also to the viewers at home . he is funny , but yet professional with his instruction , and really does a good job with the kids . - the program itself is like nothing i 've ever seen before , the movements are a combination of karate techniques ( with a non-violent approach ) , aerobic movements , and basic physical education activities , it 's a very nice blend , and it really flows together well . - and last , but certainly not least , this program is fun to do , and easy enough for all my kids to follow along with . this is terrific program
