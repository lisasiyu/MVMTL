fun , effective workout after dealing with back pain and general weakness for months , i finally decided to get proactive about the problem and start doing a daily workout . i 'd tried this dvd once before , but had no idea of the incredible effect it can have in a very short amount of time . after starting to use it daily just a few weeks ago , i already feel much more limber and energetic all day . my aching back has disappeared , my arms and legs are significantly stronger , and i feel more clear-headed and lucid all day . i can personally attest that the claims on the back of the case , that it will `` give your body an active workout and help you develop inner peace and outer strength '' are entirely true . i highly recommend this program . be aware that it 's pretty strenuous , and i often find myself sweating heavily by the end , but if you do it every day , and really put some effort into it , you 'll feel and look better very quickly
