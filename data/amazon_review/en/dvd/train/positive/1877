fun with adolph and joseph great to see gregory peck having such a good time playing arch-menace joseph mengele . the plot is plausible , if somewhat naive and short in the hard science department , but i 'd suspend my disbelief to watch sir laurence olivier play this nazi hunter anyday . the rest of the cast are a bit like card board cut-out villians and good guys , but the boy hittler is a kid only a she-wolf mother could love
