a beautiful portrait of humans i really think this movie is great , but i do n't think most people would . the love story between jeremy davies and milla jovovich is just so sweet and quiet . to be honest , i think that was the best thing about the movie , the realtionship of these two characters that was so moving . this movie just portrays the fragility and emotional complexity of people so beautifully
