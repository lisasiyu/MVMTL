five early british gems this box set contains five ealing studios comedies from the fifties that are just great examples of this genre of films . i had seen whiskey galore and a run for your money before so the other three were new to me . i liked the titfield thunderbolt the best and the maggie the least , but all are fine movies with typical english humor and good casts ( look for charles hawtry of `` carry on '' fame in passport to pimlico ) . the set is a bit pricy , but if you love the british comedies of this era , it 's not to be missed
