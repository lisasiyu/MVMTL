the best ! i absolutely love this workout dvd . it is by far my favorite . the music is fun , janis is a wonderful instructor and her kickoboxing moves really pump up my cardio . i highly recommend this one for people who like kickboxing . plus the bonus is that each segment is 10 minutes , so you can do it all or mix and match
