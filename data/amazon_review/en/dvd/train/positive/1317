great beginner dvd i really enjoyed this dvd . great moves , beautiful scenes . it relaxed me just watching it . i like the variety of workouts , some easy and some a bit more challenging . something for everyone . i started this because i had a tweek in my back , and after a few weeks i feel much better . i 'm ordering other products from this instructor . highly recommended
