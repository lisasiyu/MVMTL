a classy document of a classic band this is an illuminating glimpse into the music and song craft of the band . composed primarily of interviews with individual members of the group and producer john simon in studio settings discussing the music on their timelessly classic second studio recording `` the band '' . this one is for music lovers . many of the interviews take place at a mixing console in a studio , with john simon , robbie robertson and levon helm adjusting track levels to bring up and highlight the various components of the mix . absolutely fascinating stuff . having listened to this music hundreds of times over the past 30 years , it was revelatory to hear some of the more creative parts of this complex whole isolated , with insightful commentary from the artists who created it . also fascinating , in more of a train wreck kind of a way , was seeing the interview and solo studio performance asides of garth hudson and rick danko . both brilliant artists , but both seemingly still paying the price of the lifestyle that accompanied the height of the band 's fame . rick 's remarks on the loss of his best friend richard manuel left me with chills , knowing that not too many more months from this interview and rick would be gone from this place as well . well worth the bargain price , this will be one of those rare dvd 's that i actually return to again and again
