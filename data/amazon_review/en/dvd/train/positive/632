superb value package if bette davis is not remembered as the best actress to come out of hollywood in the golden era , she certainly was thought so at the time and this package easily demonstrates the range of her talent . this set , compared to volume one , which contains obvious davis hits , covers a wider period of her career from 1937 to 1962 . two favourite davis films , `` the man who came to dinner '' and `` marked woman '' are included . more detailed reviews of each of these films can be viewed under their individual titles so by way of a quick summary : - `` marked woman '' is a sensational 1937 film about prostitutes who go to court to get their gangster pimp incriminated . this was the first film davis made after she walked out of warner brothers and was sued for breach of contract . she lost and returned to the studio but with a new found respect . she gives an intense performance and the film is very exciting with a great downbeat ending . - `` jezebel '' is the 1938 film for which davis won her second oscar , a precursor to `` gone with the wind '' and directed superbly by william wyler . the film is a soap opera about a willful southern girl and would fall into trivia without davis 's subtle performance and wyler 's attention to detail . - `` dark victory '' from 1939 was possibly davis 's favourite role about a long island socialite with a brain tumour . the film is a tour de force for davis who might have won another oscar if the film had been released in a different year . - `` the man who came to dinner '' is an ensemble piece , an excellent version of the 1941 kaufman and hart broadway hit . davis supports monty woolley , a character based on alexander woolcott , who hilariously dominates the film . - `` old acquaintance '' from 1943 maybe the quintessential woman 's picture with davis starring with rival miriam hopkins . it is a picture which resonated with `` woman 's issues '' in 1943 and was remade in the 80 's as `` rich and famous '' . - `` whatever happened to baby jane '' is the famous teaming with joan crawford in a baroque tragedy which has become a cult ( and camp ) classic . the film was shot on a small budget and in 3 weeks and it shows . the extras alone make up hours of additional viewing which enhance the films immeasurably , although some of the commentaries are poor with far too much gossip about davis 's overanalysed relationship with joan crawford . best of all , the excellent documentary `` stardust : the bette davis story '' has been included . the collection is great value
