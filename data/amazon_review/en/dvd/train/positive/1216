radford removed the eurythmics ? i love this film and have always wanted to make a sequel , i 'm just a little miffed that they took out the eurythmics music . according to one reviewer it was on the insistence of the director , now grant it i do also like muldowney 's score ( and own that particular s-track ) and feel the newly replaced tracks work well in maintaining a bleak a-tonal atmosphere , i still sorely miss the eurythmics music and feel radford should have left it as it is or at least made sure mgm included a 2nd audio track version . this could be another unusual case of an artist not being the best judge of his own work , at least in my opinion i feel the eurythmics ' added a unique flavor and spirit to the film . i can understand at the time radford may have had studio pressure to use them as was overly common practice for just about any film made in the 80 's to have a slapped on pop tune soundtrack from whoever the hottest flavor of the year was . still i think this film was an unusual exception , interesting coincidence in the same year another pop group ( toto ) surprised many with a great score for dune .
