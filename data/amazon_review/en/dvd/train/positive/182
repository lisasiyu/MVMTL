total body workout i have n't done this workout in awhile and thought i 'd wipe the dust off of the cover and try it again . i forgot how challenging this workout is . the lower body almost killed me . i could hardly step down off my transfirmer when it was over . which is good b/c i need more strength in my lower body . the upper body was hard ( i did n't think it was as hard as the lower body though ) , with the push-ups killing me every time . i forgot how much i enjoyed this workout in the past . i will definitely add to my rotation . i had the vhs version , but i 'm glad it 's on dvd now . having it chaptered is easier , in case i want to do lower or upper body only combined with another firm workout
