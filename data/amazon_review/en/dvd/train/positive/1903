outstanding tutorial ! this dvd is very well done . unlike phil hellmuth 's dvds ( which were suprisingly inadequate ) , lederer truly takes the viewer through a number of sound , substantive advice and strategy that acheives its goal -- to provoke thought and to tighten your play . this very much added to my game and gave more , and different perspective ( s ) to this wonderful game . an earlier review claimed that it is `` not complete '' ... to which i would agree , with one caveat -- can any dvd/book/article truly `` completely '' cover such an intricate game ? maybe , if it were a collection of 10-12 disks or more ... but , even then , there are different perspectives and strategies -- some you may subscribe to , others you may not . i only wish this dvd had more to it because of the fact that it was very insightful , helpful and instructive ... i could have watched another 2 hours of lederer 's teaching . if you are looking for an instructional course that bucks the trend of those that claim so-called `` million-dollar strategies '' and fall short , and you want to improve your game -- this dvd pays for itself . lederer does n't hold back , afraid of revealing his secrets that may provide for others to beat him at the table . he lays it out in a great framework , delivering it in a way that of him really wanting to help you in your game . another great attribute -- he does n't drone on and on about his tourney conquests with an air of how great he is ( unlike some other dvds - no names mentioned phil ) . in fact , i do n't recall him talking about any of his `` great moves '' , except for situations that he has encountered and the results -- good or bad . lederer is a confident player , and it shows in his teaching of the game . highly recommended !
