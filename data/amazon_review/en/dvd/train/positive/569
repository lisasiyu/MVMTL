a great workout this is one of my all-time favorite the firm tapes . it is a great combination of cardio and strength . the time flys when i 'm doing this tape . i read the reviewer that said that these reviews were not by 'real ' people . i 'm very real and in no way connected to the firm company or any of it 's affiliates . ( sounds like legalize , but it 's true ) . i discovered the firm a couple years ago and discovered that even though i thought i was in good shape , i was wrong . firm tapes really put you through the paces . if you really do the tapes and stick with them , you will get stronger and feel better . i did n't loose a ton of weight , but i did get fit enough to be able to do a triathlon this last summer . i 've been doing workouts since before we had vhs tapes ( i used audio tapes that came with a poster that showed the moves ) . i 've tried just about every exercise instructor out there . they all have good and bad and so does the firm . but , all in all , i have to say that the firm workouts are the hardest , safest , most effective , and most fun i 've ever done .
