rated on the fun factor , but not a great film i had to give this one 4 stars just because it is so fun . it is deeply flawed at points and as deep as a puddle , yet it is funny and still has some moving moments . the nostalgia factor works as well if you were out and about at the time . affleck comes across a big dope , but that 's okay ( cuz i think he is ) . ricci is great - why is she so underutilized ? that girl has a power in her . rudd is the sweet sort of everyman good guy and it suits him well . love is , well , actually ... good here . i liked her and i felt for her character . hudson is very , very funny , particularly in her scenes with jay mohr - they have great chemistry . garoffalo is the best in a tart-tounged smaller part . definitely worth a spin for an easy-on-the-eyes comedy . best line , garoffalo in a moving cab trying to light a cigarette : these matches are disappointing me !
