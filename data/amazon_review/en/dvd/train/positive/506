great documentary ! the 6 episodes really showed how broadway evolved and how it became what it is today . it has great footage from all sorts of broadway productions from 1893 - 2004 . it empisises the great broadway producers & compsers too . the special features are very nice too . if your a fan of broadway buy the dvd set , the cd set & the book they are all great
