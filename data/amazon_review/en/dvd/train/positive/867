pretty good , 6 year old loves it i 've rented several of the barbie movies with my 6 year old and this is her absolute favorite , so i 'm thinking of buying it for her for christmas . i doubt i 'd bother buying any of the others , it 's too easy to rent them , but this one stands out for us and she keeps asking to rent it over and over again . do n't buy this if you expect to share the true story of rapunzel with your kids ; there is n't much here from the original , other than the long hair . but it 's an entertaining story ( especially if you 're a girl under the age of 10 ! ) and it teaches kids the importance of telling the truth and sticking by your friends even when it is n't the easiest thing to do . my daughter and i enjoyed the extras , too . i 've probably seen this one about 8 times so far , and i can honestly say as a parent that it 's not bad : it does n't have me running out of the room each time my daughter asks to start it up , and it does n't drive me nutty over awful , repetitive songs
