the show is great i love this show it 's my favorite show on saturday afternoon but it 's sad that they cancelled this show now i have nothing looking forward too on saturday afternoon only work but that 's it . i love brennan he 's the coolest with his electricity powers aka as the elemental . then there 's emma but she had left the show in season 3 her psyonic powers were cool . then comes jesse and that new girl i forgot her name have n't seen the show lately . then there 's shalimar i like her powers but it 's not my favorite out of all these peoples . i ca n't wait for season 2 and season 3 to come out in box set because buying it seperate cd 's costs alot of money
