delightfully funny . this movie was both entertaining and at times , hilarious . charlie sheen is great as the fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist , denise richards is funny as his ditzy , shallow girlfriend and angie harmon is appealing as the editor of the newspaper . also , jon lovitz is hysterical as sheen 's plastic surgeon best friend . this movie is a must for those who want some lighthearted humor . i highly recommend it .
