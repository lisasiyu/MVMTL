the best workout - ever ! i love the firm workout tapes . i used them before my wedding trying to get fit . they really do work in 10 workouts or less ! once i had my baby , i started using them again , and with no doubt , they worked ! this is the only workout that i really enjoy , i do n't have to work out for 2 or 3 hours to get the effective results . i think about this workout when i 'm not doing it , and i really enjoy it ! i recommend this and any other tapes from the series to anyone . trust me , you just put in the work , and the workouts do the rest ! they 're not easy , but they are effective
