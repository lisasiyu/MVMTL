a bug 's life ( collector 's edition ) a bug 's life ( collector 's edition ) ~ dave foley is one of the best animated movies that i have ever seen period . the animation is top of the line and this movie is so much better then antz . the story begins with ants collecting food for an offering , and then our `` hero '' manages to trash this cermoney and then trouble begins . the story is well developed and well written and unlike `` antz '' we are here spared pseudo political messages and this is good since the movie is after all made for children and not adults . one important message that is sent is to children is to tollerate different people and not to judge people . the music is splendid and the dialogue is right on the money . highly recommended indeed
