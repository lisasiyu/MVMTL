enchanting movie ... this is one of miyazaki 's best . in the vein of 'totoro ' but a bit more grown-up . it 's probably my favourite after 'nausicaa ' , which is his masterpiece . there is a quality to miyazaki 's animation and story-telling that is indescribable . you have to experience it to understand it . the attention to detail and the intimacy in his narration is really special . though it 's probably easier ( for english speakers ) to watch the movie with the english dialogue , it 's so much better with the original japanese soundtrack . the english dialogue lacks the softness and subtlety of the japanese version . this is a great family film ; a film people of all ages can enjoy . i am definitely going to be buying the dvd , 'cos i 'm going to want to share this movie with friends and family
