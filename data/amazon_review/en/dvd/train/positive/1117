what a great compilation bruce dickinson is one of the greatest performers of our time . not only is he fronting one of the greatest metal bands ( iron maiden , in case anybody did n't know ) , but he is also an accomplished solo artist , as well as a master fencer and airline pilot . bruce can do it all and he is'nt slowing down ! anthology is a must have for bruce completists . as far as i can tell , everything is here . 3 concerts , videos and interviews all on 3 dvds . most of this stuff i 've not seen before or it has been a long time since i have seen it . such as the shows . most of the videos i have not seen . mtv does not play the good stuff and niether does anyone else , so if you have'nt seen the videos , this set is for you . bruce conveys an intelligence that a lot of metal performers do n't exhibit . he stands above the rest and is certainly an individual muscian that is'nt afraid to try new things . if you 're into maiden and bruce 's solo stuff , you will like this set . also , roy z. , dickinson 's producer and guitarist is phenominal . adrian smith is always a joy to watch and all of bruce 's different solo bands spout great musicians . bruce is a god
