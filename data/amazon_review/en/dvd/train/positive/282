`` she loves me ! i can tell that through her screaming . '' very funny , i love the ol ' classic screwball comedies where everyone is screaming hysterically , running madly and falling all over each other . oscar 'o.j . ' jaffe , played with psychotic brilliance by john barrymore , is a hyperactive megalomaniac stage director who after discovering carole lombard and making her into a gigantic star smothers her with his controlling nature until she finally has enough and leaves for hollywood . after she leaves he has nothing but flops until he 's in danger of loosing his theater , so in one desperate last ditch effort he tries to get lombard back . how neither howard hawks nor john barrymore got an oscar nomination for this movie is a mystery to me . d : howard hawks ( rio bravo , bringing up baby ) oscar 'o.j . ' jaffe - john barrymore ( grand hotel , diner at eight ) lily garland - carole lombard ( my man godfrey , to be or not to be ) oliver webb - walter connolly ( it happened one night , libeled lady ) owen o'malley - roscoe karns ( they drive by night , it happened one night ) max jacobs - charles lane ( it 's a wonderful life , arsenic and old lace ) mathew j. clark - etienne girardot ( the kennel murder case , the hunchback of notre dame '39 )
