if i could i would give it 10 there are no words to describe this movie . the book is amazing but is does use many `` bad '' words in it . the movie uses some but nothing drastic ! ! this movie is the best . what can you expect from such an amazing cast . the developement of the characters is very well presented and this movie very likely will make you cry , male or female . after this movie you just want to watch it again and again . some of the scenes could be cut shorter but they also `` make '' the movie . after watching the movie , you should discuss it with the people who watched it with you , it 's interesting to see other peoples thoughts on this movie
