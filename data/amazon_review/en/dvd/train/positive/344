agnostics are smarter than atheists those who use evolution as proof there is no creator are , in my opinion , narrow minded . evolution only disagrees with written texts of creationism . one needs to look well beyond . if i were god i would want my people to be able to neither prove or disprove my existence ... yet i would leave some doubts or unanswerable questions for man to ponder ... like science that breaks down at the moment of the big bang . those that study the human body have barely glimpsed the complexities of this evolved life form and i find i have a gnawing feeling about how adaptive evolution alone got us all the way here . a bit of doubt leaves that door to god open , albeit not a god exactly like one 's holy book might have posited . many great scientists are believers of sorts so i find atheists to be arrogant , and agnostics perhaps closer to the truth . who knows ... if string theory is in fact reality , perhaps god resides only a dimension away
