really great fun ! i picked this up in vhs at a video store for 99 cents , figured it would be an okay piece of entertainment . boy , was i surprised ! this is an excellent bit of comedy , beautifully acted , wonderfully edited , totally enjoyable entertainment ! the dysfunctional family dynamics are hysterical , the young people are attractive and funny , the plot twists are very unexpected , and it 's simply beautifully done . do n't miss this one !
