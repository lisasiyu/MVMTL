back to its origins ... and the story twists and turns ... watching this movie was like watching part 1 , onlything things just got a lot stranger , and we 're finally getting up close and personal with the tall man . i promise that you will be left hanging . if you are watching these films strictly because of 2 and 3 , then you may be a little dis-appointed , as this one does deliver some really good action , but not at the end , the end is more suited for those who like to read into there movies , who like the stuff with lairs , such as myself , in which case , you are going to go deep into the rabbit hole with this one ! to cater to action fans , it is said that don and bruce ( campbell ) were talking about having bruce in phantasm 5 and tie the evil dead franchise into it somehow , which could work considering that both of them deal with trancendence of time and space , and both seem to root themselves in the lovecraftian mythos , not to mention the fact that phantasm 2 and 3 were total evil dead , as well as bubba ho-tep which don aslo directed ! i really can not but love don 's non-sold out way of doing things . he raises the money for his love , and pours himself into it , has a lot of fun , and always delivers something well worth watching a million times over , so long as you have the patience or interest i guess , which ever . he 's a strange one ! one of the best ! : ) p.s . this movie contains a lot of flashback scenes made from un-used footage form 79 . a blast from the past , very cool
