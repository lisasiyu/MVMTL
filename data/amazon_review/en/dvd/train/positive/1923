belongs in every pilates video library ! ! ! i do n't usually write reviews but i feel compelled to spread the word ; this workout is an excellent value . i own many fitness and pilates videos . i have also used a pilates reformer with a personal trainer . this dvd is the first workout i have seen that has someone actually perform the exercise on the reformer , then show the mat move . the production quality is excellent and the cueing is right on target ( and not in the least annoying ) . if you have never tried pilates mat work this dvd ( or the beginner version ) would be very helpful . if you are already familiar with pilates mat work , this would be an excellent addition to your library
