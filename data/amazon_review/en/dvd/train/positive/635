much better than expected after reading the reviews i thought the dvd was going to be horrible , but it 's actually pretty good , and so far one of the best instructional hip-hop videos i 've seen ( i own a groovaloos dvd and tina landon dvd and have used darrin 's dance grooves ) , and the instruction is also better than some teachers i 've taken classes from . in general , nothing beats actually having a good teacher and choreographer so they can critique your form and technique . however , i very happy that the instructor , dave scott , did give some tips on technique instead of only showing moves to copy . ( the fundamentals section is too short , but pretty good ) . i only wish he gave more tips on technique . he also breaks down routines at different tempos ( which most instructional videos do not do ) , and this is essential ! i think it 's important to get the fundamental moves right at a slower tempo first , rather than rushing through the movements just to get through the song . he does turn around from the camera a few times so you can follow the moves without confusing your left and right , but i wish he did that more . the only main problem i had is that there are only two real routines you can learn , and that 's it 's not very `` take it to the streets '' oriented . no breakdancing instruction , really , or street dancing tips . so if you want to improve your breakdancing , this is n't the best dvd to buy . overall , it 's a good dvd for the price and i would highly recommend for intermediate to advanced dancers looking to expand creative moves , improve their ticking/waving , and get ideas for choreography . for beginners , it would still be a good investment but will be fairly difficult . i would suggest that instead of matching the moves , it might be good to just mirror the instructor so you can at least get used to moving your body in certain ways .
