japanese cinema at its very best with the slew of well known asian films from the likes of kurosawa , tsui hark , ect . it is easy to overlook these precious gems known as the zatoichi series . truly incredible , shintaro katsu owns this role and plays the part so damned well you 'd swear he must have walked around every day of his life carrying a cane sword and pretending to be blind . the swordplay scenes are some of the greatest i have ever witnessed and i 've seen it all . they are so realistic and provide a nice counterpoint to the frantic flying wirework approach of the chinese . if you are a fan of japanese cinema you owe it to yourself to see these films . i guarantee you will be utterly captivated from start to finish
