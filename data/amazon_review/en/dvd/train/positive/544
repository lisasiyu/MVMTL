sexy , not serious if you 're looking for a faithful adaptation of dracula , this is not it . this is not a movie to be taken seriously . it 's a fun , popcorn movie that will not make you think . at all . seriously . not a thought in your head , unless it is to marvel at the best thing to come out of scotland since kilts , gerard butler . butler brings a frustrated sensuality to the role of dracula not seen since frank langella 's campy 1970s performance . if you 're not in love with him already , you will be after watching the dvd extras . his interviews are charming and fun . though watching his audition reel , where he tried to emote wearing full `` atilla '' hair and make-up , was sort of uncomfortable . so if you like wire fight scenes , new intrepretations of old myths , mardi gras beads and pretty scots , this is the movie for you . if you want to think , there are plenty of documentary dvds available on this site ! cheers
