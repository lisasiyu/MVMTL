one of the best remakes ever i remember that the original movie made me cry but nothing could prepare for this remake . the movie was emotionally gripping and compelling . i cried hysterically through the last half of the movie feeling the pain and disappointment that the young piccolo was going through . i was impressed by the way brian stood strong and full of faith all the way up to the end . i thought that both actors did an incredible job , but i was most impressed with sean maher 's performance . he was believable as the care-free loving husband and competitive spirited football player . this movie really is worth your time , and i can guarantee you that at least one tear will be shed for this tragic and compelling story
