why oh why do n't i read reviews before i buy ! ? ! ? ! even though this set has 4 dvds , it 's really chopped up and feels incomplete . some of this i know is a result of technical difficulties ( such as the who still playing while the broadcast was disconnected ) , but there are songs i specifically remember , and looking forward to seeing . i was very disappointed to not have the complete concert , or complete sets from bands ( and no led zeppelin ! ? ! ? ! c'mon man ) . it 's still a landmark concert , the set from queen was amazing , and the proceeds go to a good cause , but that does n't mean that i 'm not disappointed . when will the complete dvd come out
