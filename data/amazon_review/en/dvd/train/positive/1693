who 's foolin who credit has to go to the people behind april fool 's day . eschewing the typical slasher formula , the movie plays like an update of ten little indians . a group of college students are invited to muffy st. john 's island getaway for a weekend of fun and foolishness . the writers set up the fact that there are some practical jokers amongst them , so when real murders start , the viewer has to wonder if they are n't jokes , but they seem too real for the frightened crew , and hostess muffy has started to act like she 's missing a few raisins in her muffin . although it starts a little slowly , once it picks up , it has some neat suspenseful moments and a predictable but enjoyable climax . deborah foreman , ken olandt , amy steel , jay baker , clayton rohner and griffin o'neal head the cast , and it 's fun for a change of pace slasher/suspense flick
