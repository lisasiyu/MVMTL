very funny over-the-top lds humor i was very surprised by some of comments by those who gave negative reviews . this is a comedy and it was meant to be over the top . i thoroughly enjoyed it . unfortunately , many of us have met folks who approach both ends of the spectrum presented by the two main characters . this fact and similar stereotypes are what make these two caricatures so funny . my wife and i were rolling during several of the scenes . better than some lds movies ( rm , it 's latter-day night ) , nearly as good as others ( god 's army , singles ward , saints and soldiers ) , it 's worth a view if you want to have a good laugh
