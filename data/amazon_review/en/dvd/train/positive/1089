history by a great story teller this is far too big and rich a film to be contained in any summary description . it is rich in its beautiful depictions of childhood , family , and of sexual love , rich in its narrative of the growth of fascism , and fascist personalities , in pre-ww ii italy , rich in its analysis of the unjust relationship between the owners and the workers of italy 's farm lands , rich in the beauty of its sets , costumes , and scenes . it is a rough , rambling , long film , badly dubbed in the english version , but it is also an indispensable , inimitable , and immensely enjoyable journey through a vital part of modern european history . i saw the `` short '' version of the film shortly after its release in 1977 -- it did not have a long run in the united states -- and never forgot it . i saw it again , just now , thirty years later , but this time , the director 's much longer cut . it had lost none of its power .
