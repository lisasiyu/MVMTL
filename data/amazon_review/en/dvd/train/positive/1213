'' the story is told through a fictional bomb disposal squad commanded by a young engineering student turned lieutenant , brian ash . fascinating story and technical details when they stick to the actual bomb disposal material , but the personal stories are so much cliched fluff -- the main one is that ash falls in love with the daughter of a scientist working on the bomb disposal effort . they are temporarily blocked by the fact that she already has a husband who is also doing an important job -- he is one of the codebreakers at bletchley park working on the enigma secret . but not to worry -- hubby obligingly kills himself so the lovers can get together with a clear conscience . as the church lady would say `` how convenient ! '' also the one extra is nothing much , a documentary from the history channel , not on the british bomb disposal effort during the war , but just a general piece on bomb disposal in general . in conclusion , if you like realistic war stories , buy it , but use the fast forward whenever judy geeson says `` oh , brian !
