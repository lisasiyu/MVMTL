haiku + .45 semi automatic = hana bi simply stated , the most important film of the 1990 's ; probably of the last twenty years . the film is in its entirety a meditative experience , combining a slow and calm build-up of chi or prana-force-energy with explosive violence . beat takeshi 's violence , however , is not gratuitous , but righteous anger in action . as a schizoid world falls down around him , takeshi takes the role of samurai -- indeed , `` such a man was already samurai . '' this is a film of mystery , of soft color and light ocean breezes from the south china sea , and of poetry . if the warrior immortalized in book of five rings or gitopanishad has an equivalent in modern times , surely it would be in this strange character , this japanese-style colonel kurtz in hana-bi . but then , you must watch this film for yourself . you will not be the same person when it is over
