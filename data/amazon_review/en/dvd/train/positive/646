great movie , people should stop complaining if you have never seen this movie , see it now . its a thoughtfull and intriguing view of the computer industry from its roots to now . sure , some things might have been cut , but if you are like me and have never seen it before , its still a great film . great interviews and funny commentary , and no obvious axe to grind , i highly recomend it
