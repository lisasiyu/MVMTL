superb this is a great 2 act and a requiem play , and dustin and the cast do a superb job . however , it still does n't equal lee j. cobbs ' portrayal of this delusional salesman and his last years of justification of his life . i would like to see the version with frederic march as willy . i am sure this scenario about the trials and tribulation of willy loman are carried out in the real world , more times than we really know . overall , a fantastic story by arthur miller and worth 5 stars all the way
