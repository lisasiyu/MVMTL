a simple and cute kids movie my four year old loved this movie . the plot was very simple and easy to follow , nothing too complicated for her . the animation was also great for the movie 's target audience , very soft and warm . it 's a good-hearted little film and george is such a sweet , funny and cute little guy throughout . it was light on plot , probably easily predictable by anyone over the age of six , but such a cute movie that i did n't get bored watchingn it with her . this is a great movie for young children
