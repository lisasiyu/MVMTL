good clean fun for today 's kids , too . i purchased this set for my 10 year old son to watch before his first trip to camp . he could n't get enough of the stories ! he watched another episode at every oportunity . i had intended to cut off the tv time one evening just before the `` snipe hunt '' episode , but he and his younger sister begged to watch just one more episode so they could find out what a `` snipe '' was . as a parent i found it refreshing to see my children enjoying these programs . there is n't as much `` political correctness '' toying with the plots . the boys at the camp are allowed to be boys , and must face consequences for their actions . there is teasing and trick-playing , but no one is oversensitive to the jibes . one boy ( marty ) is guided through his fear of horses with both a firm and gentle hand . i highly recommend this series for all parents , especially those with boys in the 7-12 year old range . but , i must say , my 7 year old daughter loved it , too !
