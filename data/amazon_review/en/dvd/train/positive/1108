you need a crazy sense of humor to watch this i never thought this would be as funny as it was but it was . you really have to have a wacky side though , the same side you would use when you watch anchorman or harold and kumar go to white castle . i understand some people not being able to get on this level of crazy stupidity to laugh at this but if you are this is definitely a movie you and your friends need to watch . there are a lot of hidden jokes you wo n't get until the second time you watch it like when the new owner left his hummer parked outside and i just got a was spray painted in front of hummer sorry if you do n't get it . snowboarding buddies rick ( jason london ) , luke ( zach galifianakis ) , anthony ( flex alexander ) and pig pen ( derek hamilton ) are living like kings on alaska 's bull mountain . partying hard , looking for girls , and doing just about anything to have a good time is what life on bull mountain is all about . but when town founder papa muntz dies , his son ted ( willie garson ) decides to sell the mountain to a nasty colorado ski mogul john majors . everyone is going crazy because they 're losing their jobs and they ca n't afford to keep living where they are . by his plans to turn the boarding mountain into an espresso-and-tofu ski resort , and it 's up to these idiots to save the mountain .
