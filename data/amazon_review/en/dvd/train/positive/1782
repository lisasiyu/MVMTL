gentle clifford this is a great addition to a clifford collection , with nothing remotely scary or questionable . the episodes include camping it up hooray for cleo home is where the fun is lights out which all emphasize enjoying nature , and clifford 's charm school best paw forward clifford 's hiccoughs an itchy patch which generally emphases manners and being yourself . all in all , sweet , neutral entertainment for my 3 year old , though older kids would enjoy it too .
