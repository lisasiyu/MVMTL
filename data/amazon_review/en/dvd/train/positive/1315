hey pinocchio , your nose is growing ! one of the best performances jim carrey has given . a very good concept for a film . funny , refreshing , original and very well done . i felt it could have been a lot better with a little less comedy and a little more drama to get the point across better but still a must see for any jim carrey fan . great acting , casting , screenplay and filming . i recommend it
