character study allen 's september ( 1987 ) suffered from highly dismissive reviews which remains consistent with the public 's view that allen should produce comedies . allen 's willingness to risk , whether he fails or not , should be a clear invitation to consider this piece if just for the purpose of contrasting his present work with earlier films that defined him as a professional funny man . the discerning viewer might enjoy this character study about six people if he or she wants a piece that demands a bit more reflection . as other reviewers wisely point out , allen borrows from chekov , particularly uncle vanya , in september and shows us how selfishness and thoughtlessness have their repercussions on innocent bystanders . but the plot unfolds carefully as lane ( mia farrow ) struggles to deal with unrequited love for a struggling writer ( sam waterston ) and an unwelcome guest in her mother ( elaine stritch ) . i tend to favor the scenes which take place in candlelight . lane 's best friend , stephanie , ( dianne wiest ) plays the piano as various characters reveal their fears and desires in carefully constructed monologues and dialogues . we learn a great deal about how professional concerns do not always eclipse the existential questions people face or the reality that people can go on living while harboring painful regrets . eventually , a particular truth surfaces which sends the characters reeling but allen gives us a reprieve by offering an ending that is fair albeit unnerving . allen fans who enjoy his comdies should switch gears to view this film . like his more sober films , september offers viewers the pleasure of character development as the fuel which moves the film forward .
