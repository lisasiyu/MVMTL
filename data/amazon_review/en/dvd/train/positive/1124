excellent movie i grew up watching martial arts movies and always wanted to see one that has more depth and meaning . this movie does not follow the sterotypical path of most chinese martial arts films . the actors communicate on many different levels that one would not expect . i was very pleased and inspired by this movie . this will be on the top of my favorites list for many decades
