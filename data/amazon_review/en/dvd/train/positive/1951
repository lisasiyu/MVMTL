apples and oranges paul reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we do n't see , what we expect and what surprises us . the thing about my folks does n't set any new standards for film , but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents . sam kleinman ( peter falk ) has been a workaholic , at times pushing his wife muriel ( olympia dukakis ) , his daughters ( mackenzie connolly and lydia jordan ) , and his son ben ( paul reiser ) into the background . one day muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving ! her daughters , along with ben 's wife rachel ( elizabeth perkins ) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts , leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle sam to sort things out on a road trip with son ben . the road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members . sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic ben to the pleasures and fun of living . the trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story 's warm ending . all is not what it seemed : it 's better and , well , different . falk and reiser play off each other like the pros they are , but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when olympia dukakis is on screen , reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film . well worth viewing . grady harp , january 0
