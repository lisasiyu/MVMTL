4 1/2 stars jessica alba in a bikini ! a must see jared ( paul walker ) and sam ( jessica alba ) are a pair of salvagers living a poor but mostly happy existence on the shores of the bahamas waiting for that day when they 'll finally find the sunken treasure ship that will solve all their problems . when jared 's old friend bryce ( scott caan ) arrives on the island to relax it looks like their dreams will come true when they find the wreckage of the pirate ship zephyr . unfortunately , the zephyr is resting next to the a crashed drug plane carrying 800 kilos of cocaine ... cocaine its owner ( james frain ) wants back . into the blue has great acting , good directing , great special effects , and good writing . let me start off with saying i definitely prefer paul walker not driving fast cars and this film just proves i 'm right . the acting in this film has got to be its strongest point jessica alba does another great job in her third movie of 2005 and paul walker does a great job as well . scoot cann also has a standout performance as the standalone jerk ! the special effects were probably the second best aspect because since basically all of it was underwater they did a very exceptional job like with the explosions and stuff . the writing and directing were also very good but i believe the acting stood out the most . overall if you like jessica alba or paul walker or underwater adventures you 'll love this movi
