head of it 's class ! one of the best of the head-in-a-box genre ( see also `` the head '' ( 1959 ) victor trivas , dir ; `` the frozen dead '' ( 1966 ) starring dana andrews ) this particular movie is enlivened by the relentless saxophone score and the notion of a man out shopping for bodies for his decapitated fiancee at strip clubs . hey ! might as well have the best ! the story is straightforward and stupid : a car crash decapitates the fiancee , so of course the only rational response to this predicament is to keep her head alive in a box in the basement . why could n't he keep her body alive , too , then just stitch them back together ? well , the scientist boyfriend must have lost his head because he did n't think about this course of action . or many he was thinking with his little head and seized the opportunity to create a more bodilicious girlfriend with some cut and paste action ! anyway , the girlfriend gets jealous ... watch out for a woman scorned ! `` no baby , it 's not like that . i was at the strip club looking for new bodies for you ! '' yeah right try that out around my house and see what happens . anyway , the plan goes awry and the nasty humanoid critter gets out of the closet ( ohhh i 'm in a cold sweat over that one ) and the movie finally ends . and not with the expected bang , either . fabulous hideous terrible schlock . highly recommended !
