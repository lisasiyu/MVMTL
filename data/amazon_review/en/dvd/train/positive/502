when the dolls ruled for those of you who saw the dolls back in the '70 's , this is a time capsule version that brings you back to max 's kansas city , kenny 's castaways , club 82 , and more . the dolls are young , brash , alive , and vital . seeing johnny healthy and built , or jerry nolan chubby , it 's worth the price of admission . all of the dolls are energetic and engaging . at the time , the world was their oyster and there was no place to go but up . great sloppy chaotic versions of their greatest non-hits . a nice feature of the dvd is the performance only section , as well as the commentary . it does bog down a little in the middle , but picks right back up again as soon as the band hits the stage . some of the comments are very funny . the black & white photography lends a `` historic '' feel . it 's way better than it should be , given the time & technology advances since then . it ends around with the red patent leather gigs at the little hippodrome , but without fan fare or anything maudlin .
