multi-cultural view of domestic violence this movie was good , but as usual the book was far better . i think it showed that her husband had some tendencies towards wanting to dominate his wife , which turned into full-blown abuse under the stresses of losing his job & medical license , and returning to shiite iran after decades of living in the united states . i think the book shows that he was n't this `` dream husband '' that suddenly turned into a monster . the warning signs were there all along - for example , she met him when he was her physician and he kissed her right on the treatment table - obviously , an inappropriate action . what was amazing to me is that other americans in iran did little to help betty , saying she needed to submit , what 's the problem ? etc , while it was the iranians who understood moody 's family history & reached out to help her in a real way - helping her use the phone , finding ways for her to escape the dangerous oppression of her husband , and ultimately smuggling her out of the country . the movie seems a little overblown , because , well , it 's a movie ... they dramatize things . i recommend reading the book , too , which is betty 's true story
