christopher walken of course , christopher walken is one of the all time best actors and abel ferrara is an outstanding cult director . their co-operation is probably among the best ever happened to cinema . although the story itself is nothing to cheer about , especially where ex-con walken goes charity , the acting and photography is worth watching this movie over and over again . great acting by larry fishburne as well .
