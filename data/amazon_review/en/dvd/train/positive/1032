heartwarming and good for an evening in ... ... ... for anyone who has ever longed for a second chance with the one they `` gave away '' ... ..for anyone who has ever wished they could go back and do something over in a different way ... have that second chance to say things that went unsaid or maybe to try and say them better ... or even just the urge to re-experience a special point in time when `` feeling '' was what life was all about , this movie should be right up your alley . it is a sweet and charming little love story that i have actually watched a few times ... ... .and still like it
