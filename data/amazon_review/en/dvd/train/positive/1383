care-a-lot is a place we all can go . . . the care bears movie is a wonderful movie for the whole family . with great voice acting , including mickey rooney as the narrator , mr. cherrywood , this is a special treat that will warm your heart and make you laugh . the opening song was written and sung by the great carole king . it sets the stage for what the care bears are all about . in their clouds and rainbow filled care-a-lot , they look down and see children who have stopped caring and need a friend . little stars flit about and help them . the story is about a magician 's assistant named nicholas who finds a magic book with an evil spirit . nicholas has always felt lonely . the evil spirit takes advantage of that , and uses him as a pawn in her scheme to get the world to stop caring . this is almost too much for the gentle care bears . luckily , they get some help from a kind lion who lives in the forest of feelings with other cute critters . there are lots of cute songs that make the whole film touching and delightful . as far as this being a feature-length commercial , the only thing that smacks of commercialism is when more and more care bear cousins keep popping out of the woodwork with no character development or dialouge . but that is minor . my husband even loved this movie and was humming along at the closing song !
