baseball mysticism - give us a choice my all time favorite sports movie next to `` pride of the yankees '' and `` hoosiers '' . the only criticism i have is that they should have made two endings . the `` upbeat one '' used in the hollywood release and the `` gritty downer ending '' as read from the final pages of the book . and let the viewer choose before watching the film . i 'd still pick the one used by hollywood but it would have been nice to have malmed 's literary ending also .
