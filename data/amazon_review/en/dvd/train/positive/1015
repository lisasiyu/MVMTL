it is n't texas ! ! ! this is probably my most favorite movie ever , but i would like to point out to all the people , including the official amazon.com review , that it is n't texas ! the movie was filmed in kern county- specifically bakersfield , california . nowhere in the movie does it imply that it is texas , and in fact locals will recognize many landmarks from the 70 's , including i think it is 19th street with the hub ( where we all bought western clothing and boots ) , the pawn shops , and the porn shops . the turn-off where bobby gets caught up playing a piano on the back of the pick-up truck is to shafter , ca , one of the small dust-bowl era farm towns in kern county . the bowling alley was freddy 's top of the hill on union avenue , where we all went bowling in high school . bobby works not in the texas oilfields , but in the oilfields , now for the most part non-producing ( although the oil supposedly is still there , just being held for economic reasons ) , that are located out near taft . now that that is cleared up- the movie itself is incredible and in my opinion nicholsons ' best and most raw acting , without the goofy cliche crazy nicholson schtick that characterizes his later work . his scene with his father before he leaves is pure , open , painful emotion- and one of the best performances on-screen of any actor , ever
