here is a classic ! in the midst of widower ( mortician ? ) ( colin firth ) , cedric brown 's troubles comes a frightful looking witch-of-a-nanny , hairy warts and all . with her stern-looking unibrow and bucktooth , she transforms the lives of seven children with one thump of her craggy looking cane . if childrearing were this easy , us mothers would all purchase a similar walking stick ! ( i noticed emma had a similar one when she appeared at the premiere ) . can i please borrow it , ms. thompson ? my daughter and i were kept in stitches with all of the silly antics and we truly enjoyed this entertaining family movie written by the dame herself , emma thompson . it was loosely based on christianna brand 's nurse matilda books , and who better to play the plum role of nanny mcphee , than ms. thompson ? one thing though , did disappoint me . nanny mcphee was so good with the children and so pretty at the end -- that my daughter and i wondered why mr. brown could n't have married her ? angela lansbury was wonderfully quirky as the hoity toity aunt adelaide who held the purse strings and coerced mr. brown into taking a bride . it was hilarious how , while he was wooing the opportunist mrs. quickly ( celia imrie ) , his rambunctious little imps did their best to sabotage things . colin firth as mr. brown was dynamic . so was the scullery maid evangeline ( kelly macdonald ) . and , in the end , everything comes together like some magnificent fairy tale , snow in august , and all . kirk jones , directed . beware of dark undertones if you 're wary of witchcraft . this review refers to the dvd
