excellent guide i ordered this guide so that i could understand all of the options and functions available on my new nikon d200 . since it is a video that i could watch , pause , then continue watching it was easy for me to understand . the explanations made a lot of sense . there are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the d200 works but how to use the various functions to take better photos . i highly reccommend it
