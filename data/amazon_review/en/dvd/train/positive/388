tootsie `` tootsie '' holds a place on both the american film institute 's top 100 movies ( # 62 ) and the american film institute 's top 100 comedies ( # 2 ) . oddly enough , on the latter list it 's directly below `` some like it hot '' and both films have simalar subjects . ironically , both subjects are some of the most stereotypical ones . comedies come out every year involving men dressing as women for some purpose ; only some films pull it off with dignity and real heartfelt humor , though , which is why i think tootsie is so popular . michael dorsey ( dustin hoffman , in a wonderful performance ) is a down on his luck actor . he 's been living in new york city trying to make it for twenty years and nothing 's happening . one day his agent ( played by the films director sydney pollack ) explains to michael that no one wants to work with him . taking matters into his own hands , michael dresses as a woman and adapts a higher voice and becomes dorothy michaels ; michael , under his new guise , auditions for a soap opera and wins the role ... and acclaim . at the same time , he falls in love with julie ( jessica lange , who won an oscar for the role ) who is dating the director ( dabney coleman ) . meanwhile , michael manages to neglect a potential girlfriend ( teri garr ) and freak out his roommate jeff ( bill murray , who 's hilarious as always ) . in retrospect , you 've seen this film thousands of times ... while i was n't alive the year the film came out , i ca n't say this is the originator of this storyline , but it is one of the best films to evolve from that storyline . dustin hoffman , who is almost always good , is great in the dual role ( although his five o'clock shadow can be seen under the makeup in several scenes ) . lange is beautiful and wonderful in the role . this is a great movie , if you have n't seen it ... well ... see it . grade :
