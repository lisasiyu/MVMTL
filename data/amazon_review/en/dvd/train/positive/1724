top speed ? unlimited ! loved the great `` real time '' high performance footage and legitimate sound effects . this little known flick is right up there with bullitt and vanishing point as far as the action driving sequences go . i 'm thrilled that it has finally been released on dvd . if you 're a mopar fan , it 's a must have for your car chase collection .
