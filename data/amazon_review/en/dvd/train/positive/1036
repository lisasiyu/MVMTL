a classic movie beautifully restored for sight and sound ! i remember the first time i saw this movie . my mom took me to see it at our local theatre and it was 1961 . they even had an intermission so you could get more popcorn ! ! i just loved the movie and when i was older ( was only 10 when i saw movie ) read the book as well . so of course when we saw this beautiful edition on sale at our local electronics store i had to have it ! ! it is just amazing what they can do now to `` clean up '' the sound so the scratches and static on older vhs/dvd formats are gone and it sounds just like it did in the theatre . i was also extremely impressed with the re-colorization they did to bring back the green in viven leigh 's eyes -- she really did have the scarlett o'hara eyes -- that was lost in the older versions . the story is uplifting and sad at the same time . it was a time in the south that is often forgotten . it is also a story that you ca n't place in the context of today 's world or it would seem silly or racist or violent . however , margaret mitchell , the author of the book it is based on , did romanticize the south a lot so you do have to take the storyline and so forth with a least a pound of salt ! ! for me the most unforgettable performances are of butterfly mcqueen and clark gable . if you 've never seen this movie , it is well worth watching just for the visuals and those two performances . wonderfully restored
