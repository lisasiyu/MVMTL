best disney ever ! this disney is right up there with the tops , like 'lady and the tramp ' . it should not be missed . the annimation is wonderful and the characters fabulous , such as the voice of candy candido as 'fidget ' , and of course vincent price , who is priceless as professor ratigan . everyone will love it !
