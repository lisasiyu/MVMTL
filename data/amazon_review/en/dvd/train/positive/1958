a fun movie there are far too few movies that are made just for fun these days . down periscope is proof that you do n't need fancy special effects or a giant budget to make a fun movie . my teenagers loved it , setting it up on the same shelf with zoolander and super-troopers . kelsey grammer does a wonderful job and seems to relish his role , playing it with the controlled fun that is the hallmark of the movie . known for his unorthodox activities he has drawn the ire of admiral graham ( bruce dern who appears to be having a lot of fun in his role as well ) and ends up with the worst crew that can be dredged up and the worst sub ( an old rusty diesel boat ) that can be found and the worst assignment - to go up against the entire modern navy . fortunately grammer is up to the task and the underhanded tactics and brilliant maneuvers he performs will bring a laugh from almost everyone . the crew consists of stereotypes , from the flatulant cook , to the grizzled old veteran , to the spoiled son of an admiral , to the basketball star , to the spit-and-polish xo , but the actors manage to bring them off with charm , especially the electrician who grammer notes has `` absorbed a lot of voltage '' . in addition to the big laughs , there are the little scenes that bring a smile , such as during the first dive when a panicked crewman heads aft to `` see if the other rooms are still tilted '' ultimately it is a feel-good movie . it does n't highlight any great moral conflicts , but its a great diversion to settle down and enjoy on a rainy day and one of the few movies you will probably get your teenagers to sit with you and watch ! of special note , san franciscans will immediately notice the backdrop used is the `` mothball fleet '' in suisun bay and the docked sub shots of the `` stingray '' are the uss pampanito , a sub open for tours at pier 39 - you can even see the other piers at the end .
