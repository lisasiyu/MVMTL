the decade of the women on the top ! the social convulsion of the seventies affected all the layers of the family ; many men simply gave up and many women had to face the life with major realism and mercurial energy . the pivot in this sense might be found in the legendary cult movie of john cassavetes : `` a woman under the influence '' , but the raising of such talented actresses on stage such as jane fonda , glenda jackson , catherine deneuve , rommy schneider , hanna schygulla , liv ullman , julie christie , vanessa redgrave , sally field , jill clayburgh , diane keaton , or ellen burstyn were far to be a mere casualty ; they responded to a vision of a world in crisis at different levels , emotional , affective and existential . jill clayburgh ( one of my everlasting favorite american actresses ) will undertake the exigent task of facing her own life after his husband walks out on her . one of the top american movies of the seventies !
