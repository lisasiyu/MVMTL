not the same old watp workout i just did this workout for the first time and i have to say it was a refreshing change from the usual kicks , knee lifts , side steps and marching of the other watp series . it was interesting and fun . if you are familiar with any of leslies tapes , you know that there is constant chatter and it will sometimes get weird , and the queing will be off , but that is leslie . the moves are n't complicated , so you may miss a second or two , but can catch up easily . in spite of all that , i find her a motivating instructor and i guess that she is laughing all the way to the bank since she sells jillions of dvds/videos despite not being perfect .
