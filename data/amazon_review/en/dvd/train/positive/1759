bleak and despairing ... . this is a great film , but it is very depressing and probably the bleakest film of eastwood 's career . many have said that clint 's film , million dollar baby , was depressing . that film was sad , but there was a sort of transendence at the end of it . this film has nothing like that . the 3 boyhood friends , played by penn , robbins , and bacon , have all gone their seperate ways in life when they are reunited when penn 's daughter is murdered . after an inital meeting where they all share their grief , the tensions between the friends increase as the mystery unfolds . robbins is especially good ( and deserving of his academy award ) as the man who was molested as a young man , and who is permanently scarred because of it . while at first you feel sympathy for penn 's character , you realise slowly that penn is really a cruel , brutal man . bacon is very good as the detective , the only character of the three who really seems to be balanced , even though his wife has left recently , and he is a typically cynical detective . the film ends brilliantly on an ambiguous , dark note , with kevin bacon giving penn a `` i know what kind of person you really are '' at the end of the film . this is a disturbing , brooding film , one of eastwood 's darkest ( even darker than unforgiven ) , but it 's definitely worth all the accolades that it has received . it has the marks of a great tragedy , because like all tragedies , things never worked out for the best , they seemed to have worked out for the worst , but we 're really not sure . great film ... .
