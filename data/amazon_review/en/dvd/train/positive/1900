where 's my fabricated half inch pipe ? this movie is excellent , and probably much better than any subsequent work done by moore . my kids love it , especially his lamentation in the bar after being fired . i have to admit that i never was a big moore fan - his work done with peter cook was a bit offensive , and this movie proves that humour need not offend . mark fredericks esq
