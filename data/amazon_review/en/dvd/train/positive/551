real doc or commissioned vanity piece ? whatever the motivations may have been behind this 1985 film concerning sting 's somewhat self-concious transition from spiky-haired posterboy for the 80 's new wave scene to serious jazz artiste , the fact remains that it is one of the better rockumentaries out there . director michael apted delivers an ultra-slick production with an `` a+ '' grade in the cinematography , editing and sound departments as we follow sting and his crack back up band ( ex-weather report , miles davis players ) rehearsing in a french chateau for a `` debut '' performance in paris . most of the material is from the outstanding `` dream of the blue turtles '' album ( which sting has yet to match since-this was his artistic peak , imho ) . there are some `` oh so precious '' moments-especially a sequence depicting a `` goofy '' photo-shoot in paris , with sting being chased through public squares ( and most embarassingly , a public fountain-what , suddenly he 's anita ekberg in `` la dolce vita '' ? ) by a hyper little weasel wielding a camera and wearing a fez , who i really wished to see drop-kicked into the seine . my favorite `` spinal tap '' moment : sting 's dictatorial manager ( miles copeland , former police svengali and founder/president of irs records ) goes off on a set designer for her `` lack of imagination '' on what he perceives to be a drab and dismal stage look for the big show , against which she admirably stands her ground and testily retorts that sting had told her he wanted a `` brechtian effect '' . ( you could n't write something that funny . ) the tardy yet belated release of the film on dvd should satisfy rock doc collectors with its excellent sonics , sparkling transfer and bonus videos from the period
