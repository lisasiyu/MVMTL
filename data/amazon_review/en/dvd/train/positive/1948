one of my favorite movies of all time and it 's a very personal choice . i can totally understand the reviewers who said `` huh ? '' because it 's just that kind of a movie . you either get it or you do n't , as the one featured reviewer pointed out ( a reviewer whose review i was quite amused to see , as i agree with every word of it , and that probably will never happen again ) . yes , the acting is overdone ( or `` stylized , '' if you 're one of the people enamored of this film ) . the plot is implausible and absurd ( or `` fantasy-like and surreal '' ) . the musical choices are a bizarre hodge-podge ( or `` brilliantly eclectic '' ) . about the only thing there could be no argument about is ms lane : you know how good she looks now ? imagine what she looked like in 1984 in a red and black leather mini-dress . i think my feelings are best summed up by the monologue of raven in this 1984 box-office bomb that i 've seen more times than any other film besides escape from new york : `` you 're making this harder than it has to be . you and me fall in love for a week or two . i let you go . no one gets hurt . '' that 's what you do with this film for 90 minutes . and with dvd technology , able to skip the slow parts , you can get this down to about 45 minutes of nearly rapturous bliss .
