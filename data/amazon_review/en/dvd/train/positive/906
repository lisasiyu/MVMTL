beyond inspiration being from new england , it is easy to say that this to me was one of the greatest things that ever happened , ever , the amazing 2001 season from the n.e . patriots . even if you ai n't that into sports , maybe just inspirational films that put a huge sh** eating grin on your face ... this is a dvd to own ( at least to check out.. ) i of course was issued a copy of this after the superbowl win in 2002 , being from new england , but only dug it out recently to view it . besides telling the story in detail about the season , game for game , it is also produced very well , by using the real nfl film footage , that is much more in depth than what we all saw on tv back when it happened . right on the sidelines with the players , you get to watch ( half the time you can see that they are almost as amazed with themselves as we were ) i guess i should spare the story , because it is written in every other review here , and really its much better shown on the dvd , but to remember the state of the team at that point ... last place underdogs the whole season . even as the team barrel rolled and got bigger and better , game for game , no one believed they would do it ( maybe us new englanders did , but we were still crossing our fingers pretty damned hard ) .. but everytime the stakes got higher , the team got hotter ( not to mention a few divine miracles , like the enormous hurricane during the raiders game ) you just got ta watch this thing , and see how crazy the team really got , spectacular moves all over . this is one of those sports stories that should grace the big screen ... a story you could n't make up . rock on pats ! p.s . regarding the tribute to 9/11 , god bless to all ... . but i really hate u2
