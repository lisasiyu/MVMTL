a taboo subject handled superbly by malle louis malle 's sensitive and delicate look at sexual initiation . set in 1954 , benoit ferreux plays a 14-year-old boy from dijon ; his father is a cold , uncaring gynecologist ; his mother ( played brilliantly by lea massari ) is a free spirit . he contracts scarlet fever , which cause a heart murmur , and goes with his mother for a cure to a hotel/spa . he meets some girls there , and massari openly sees a lover ; she does n't hide anything about this from him - in fact , she openly solicits his sympathies when she leaves her lover rather than go off with him . massari 's and ferreux 's closeness is gradually developed until they go to bed together . this act of incest is a special moment for both , and malle must be praised for not exploiting it or making it sordid . massari , as i said , is excellent , and it 's not an easy role to play . the movie is both a commentary on the vapidness of the french bourgeoisie and an affirmation of life on a personal level . there is also a great charlie parker musical score . a wonderful movie all around
