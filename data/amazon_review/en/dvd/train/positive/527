a 4-star movie with a 5-star ending this was a great little movie . it was n't a stand out in the genre , but it had all the elements it should have had ; a great lead cast , clever and funny writing , and most importantly , a good story . where it lacked , and lacked badly , is in the supporting cast . chris kattan and parker posey were the weak links in both acting and story line , and in my opinion cost the movie a 5th star . the story around adam and steve was very well done and i enjoyed the casting . [ who knew malcolm gets had that body ? ? ] . it was a delightful movie night for my hubby and i . we 're both suckers for a sappy , happy ending , and this movie delivered .
