absolutely the best comedy i 've ever seen . well , nothing i say will be new considering the number of reviews but here goes : i have never seen anyone get into character like ricky gervais did for david brent , the transformation is total . even after watching the series and seeing ricky in interviews it 's hard to believe they 're not two distinct people . the super-ego of david brent is so hard to reconcile with ricky 's humble nature . the humor on the show is top notch almost completely subtle , even the extremely obtuse humor is funny on a subtler level . the two episodes which comprise the christmas specials , as the dude would say , really tie the series together and leave me with a feeling of closure with regard to the series . the supporting cast did their jobs perfectly , each normal in their own way with the exception of garreth . this normality highlights the ridiculous nature of david 's ego and cognitive dissonance and makes his character even more hilarious / uncomfortable . perhaps most importantly , the feeling that the cast is having a lot of fun comes across the more you watch it . thanks , ricky and steven for creating this spectacular and unforgettable series !
