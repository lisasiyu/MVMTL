addictive viewing . brilliant presentation we came to the west wing late and from a country outside the usa . we have found it compelling viewing with some episodes that used all aspects of cinema so well they went far beyond the usual tv fare . watching them all back to back from this box set you can have some quibbles such as unueven character development at times ( people do things very much 'out of character ' occasionally ) and everyone has the same sense of humour ( which i 've never found in a workplace ) . but i think these things were more noticeable watching them all at once . in a long series such as this the writers could be forgiven for drifting and forgetting from time to time . the acting is almost uniformly excellent . i 'd like to particularly applaud the packaging of this box set . its a compact way of presenting 45 disks and is very appropriate to the series -a blue leather folio with files for each season inside.it also has several lavish accompanying booklets . clever and appropriate marketing . the price was fine too - reasonable 'per season ' cost as sold by amazon
