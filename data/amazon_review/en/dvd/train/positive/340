disney at its best unfortunately there have been some negative reviews towards this film , which in my opinion is one of disney 's best motion pictures . the art is gorgeous and sets a tone that is lacking in the newest disney films . even with the advent of computer generated images and improved techniques for classic animation , the old disney art presents a certain character and feel that i prefer over the newest animation . i 've watched this multiple times with my 2 year old cousin and he enjoys it quite a bit . it 's a classic that follows the tradition of films such as lady and the tramp , the sword in the stone , and robin hood
