pretty woman meets leon . i thought this was a good action movie with a reasonable plot and better than average acting , with a budget probably no bigger than an average jackie chan movie . the ending was novel and jet li & # 8217 ; s use of needles , to supplement his martial arts skills , added a fresh touch . jet li looks convincing , with respect to his characterisation . and bridget fonda looks good too .
