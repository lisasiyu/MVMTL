great first dramatic effort by tim meadows ... wow ! just wow ! i am impressed with this one . i was certainly surprised and a bit skeptical when i first heard about this one , seeing how i normally associate tim meadows , with flat , not very funny , comedies , when he stars , and very vague cameo and side roles in other adam sandler and will ferrel main headliner movies ! but this one , wow ! he is really a talented individual ! i should n't be so quick to judge though . his role in boogie nights , also featured some wonderful comedic actors by mr. meadows , and he was the comic relief of that movie , featuring marky mark . i also like how this movie , once again paired up nick nolte and mr. meadows , for the first time since 48 hours ! nothing short of brilliance , i say ! while mr. meadow 's role was much more dramatic in hotel rwanda , keep in mind , he did show a sufficient amount of that `` angry black '' character he is famous for in 48 hours . definitely pick up this movie ! you wo n't be sorry ! mc white said : you 'd have to be crazy not to pick this movie up , and memorize all of the main character 's names ! two thumbs way up ! ! !
