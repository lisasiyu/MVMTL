i get it now so this is real-life anime . wow . i 'm stunned . where perfect blue and millennium actress failed , tokyo godfathers greatly achieves . i loved this film . it 's real-life anime with characters most of us have been at one time . we 've all struggled -- some to the point of being homeless . we 've all had defeating family issues . and we 've all wanted nothing more than to get away ; this movie captures both that fantasy and that reality in one anime package . and the story itself is touching . how can you not feel for these homeless people as they struggle to get a child back to its rightful mother ? these three very unique individuals struggle to no end , facing bodily harm , organized crime , aids , and a possessive father , just to get this tiny little child to a safe place , a home , where it can be loved . and all of their efforts comes across as genuine . excellent
