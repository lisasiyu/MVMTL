bond is back ! move over pierce brosnan and timothy dalton . daniel craig is the best bond in 20 years and has resurrected the franchise that was on life support . the first thing you notice about casino royale is that it is absent of all of the cheesy gimmickery of the old bond movies . the stunts and effects are believable . the acting is understated and real . the plot is fresh and new . daniel craig 's performance gives a hint of sean connery . but it 's not an imitation of connery . craig makes the role his own . this is a whole new bond . the cliche is that this movie is bond for the 21st century ( the terrorist angle ) , when it actually just brings bond back to his roots . he is cunning more than he is charming . ( unlike roger moore ) he is different , he is new , he reinvents what you think a secret agent in her majesty 's secret service should be . if you are looking for the trademark bond staples such as the martini ( shaken , not stirred ) - the easy women , the endless supply of aston martins etc ... this movie may disappoint . craig is rough around the edges but just smooth enough to make you believe that he deserves to be the newest `` double-oh '' . i suggest buying this dvd in 1080p blu-ray because of the spectacular cinematography , shot on location in prague . it wo n't disappoint . the best part about the movie , without giving too much away , is that the ending leaves you wanting more . is n't that the goal of any great series ? i give it 5 stars .
