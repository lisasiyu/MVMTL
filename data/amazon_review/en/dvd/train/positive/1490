the most romantic movie ever ! ! ! somewhere in time is by far the most transcendant romantic movie i have ever seen . it is old . christopher reeve made it before we knew him as superman ; jane seymour was his co-star . reeve had just graduated college when a very old woman approaches with a gift . from then on it is breathtaking , following a time-travel episode that moves the story forward to an unforgetable conclusion , which does not really conclude in your memory ! there is also a soundtrack of the movie with the most hauntingly beautiful music i have ever heard . i would n't be without either . you will love this movie and the music
