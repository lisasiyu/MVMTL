great ! first off to all you 50 cent haters who keep posting neg reviews for his items , you can all eat a motherf***** d*** in hell . anyway i 'm a big fan of 50 so i went to the cinema and saw this and it was n't that bad . i reviewed tupac 's resurrection a few days ago which i also enjoyed , but it 's a documentary this is a real movie ! here is another rapper who started off living in the ghetto hustling then went to rapstardom . if you like violent films than this is certainly for you , like i said i 'm a 50 cent fan but you do n't have to be a 50 cent fan to enjoy this movie . it has music from the soundtrack played in it which is another thing you should checkout which is all great . those of course were n't the songs he was singing back then but we all want to hear new 50 . the film is like i said violent with course language , drug reference and sex scenes but it is very entertaining . i saw it twice at the cinema and now i think i will purchase the dvd and so should you . awesome
