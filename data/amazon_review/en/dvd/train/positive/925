jack 's best work i ca n't remember when i saw this one on the big screen . it was not long after easy rider and we had the idea that this jack nicholson had something to say to our 60's-70 's counter-culture . he did have something to say with some of the sharpest acting i had ever seen . he out-classed the james dean 's and marlon brando 's , but not with ease . jack was workin ' hard , switching from depressed concert pianist to hillbilly good time dude to misunderstood romeo in five-minute intervals . no , make that changeable temperament every five seconds , truly an artistic milestone . throw in an equally magnificent portrayal by karen black , sexy and hillbilly ; jessica simpson , eat your heart out , and you have the couple of the year , 1970 . jack 's father is one of those evil patriarch 's that hurt their kids bad , pushing them to greatness without an ounce of love . consequently , the siblings are brilliant and eccentric . the daughter is a frumpy dope . the older son is a violinist with a neck injury , and then there 's handsome jack , shiftless , moving from bed to bed , crossing the country , a boozing bum . back in the vietnam years there was an examination of bourgeois life . did we have to get a job and get married ? was everyone in a particular cubbyhole , mail in the funeral ? hence , we had the counter-culture , drugs , long haired hippies , sexual openness , and shiftless lifestyles . bob rafelson 's film gives you that , but mercifully , with subtly . that last scene at the gas station says it all . i think directors would be hard pressed to sum up a film 's theme so effectively with so little noise - amazing .
