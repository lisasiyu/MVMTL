a real treasure ! i ordered this dvd when it first came out and i 've been enjoying it ever since . all the performances are enjoyable- some more than others , but they are all wonderful nonetheless . some of my pesonal favorites include : patti lupone bringing down the house along with mandy patinkin and bob gunton doing the song `` a new argentina '' from evita . this is definately one of my top 5 favorites on this dvd . anegela lansbury providing a hilarious performance in `` the worst pies in london '' from sweeny todd : the demon barber of fleet street carol channing singing the nothing-less-than inspirational `` before the parade passes by '' from hello , dolly ! yul brynner performing `` shall we dance ? '' with his co-star ( not sure of her name ) . this performance is priceless and so is that dress ! john raitt 's beautiful baritone voice soars in this song- '' hey there '' from the pajama game paul lynde delivers a ton of laughs in `` kids '' from bye bye birdie joel grey and cast perform the spectacle that is cabaret in the song `` willkommen '' . this song never gets out of your head ! gwen verdon and chita rivera- two of broadway 's top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from chicago : `` all that jazz '' and `` nowadays '' . bob fosse 's coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment . jerry orbach . his death was a tragic loss to the theater . that 's why these dvd 's are so remarkable . this is another top performance- the song `` lullaby of broadway '' from 42nd street . it was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to nyc to see my very first broadway show- 42nd street . andrea mcardle and the orphans perform `` tomorrow '' and `` you 're never fully dressed without a smile '' from annie . this is just superb . there 's absolutely no flaws . betty buckley and cast perform two songs from cats- '' jellicle songs '' and the classic `` memory '' . it is stunning to watch . any performance with patti lupone in it is a gem in itself . this one- `` buenos aires '' from evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of eva peron . bonnie franklin and cast are hilarious in the song `` applause '' from the show applause . the whole theme to the song is 100 % true and kind of `` hits home '' for every actor . plus , it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you 're a big fan of musicals . all in all , this dvd is totally worth buying ! and after you 're through with this one and have memorized all the songs , check out broadway 's lost treasures ii . i have yet to receive iii , but i am looking forward to it !
