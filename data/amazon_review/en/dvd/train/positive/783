great italian mob movie i just happend to rent this movie from blockbuster one night after reading the info on it . i was blown away ! what a great movie the actors are highly underated and are now some of my favorites . another thing that was cool was that the actor william dameo played the voice of paulie in the new video game mafia and many of the same character names are used in this film that were from the video game . tell ya what ... look out for the actors in this movie , all of them should be leading actors in the years to come . get this movie , it will be one of your favorites
