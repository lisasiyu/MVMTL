mickey spillane is mike hammer having watched a number of mike hammer t.v . shows , i was looking forward to seeing what the author ( mickey spillane ) could bring to his creation . i was not disappointed . i was , in fact , suprised by how well he played mike hammer , and i would definitely recommend this film to fans of all ages . the only thing that bothered me about the film is the often annoying soundtrack . note : the movie is in widescreen forma
