my token to see the show without going to see it ! unfortunately , cathy rigby is retiring from peter pan next year and my mom says i ca n't go see it at madison square garden . i 've never seen the show with cathy in it , but i 've seen mary martin 's version on tv many times and i know that rigby was totally awesome . fortunately , my mom says i am allowed to get the dvd and even at 17 , i 'll still watch it ! i hope i can enjoy the dvd without seeing cathy rigby perform live at msg . ( sniffle ... ) i also hope that many people can look at cathy rigby 's performance and know that with this dvd , she 's doing the show forever
