jackie + tucker = hk meet hollywood plot of this one is not guide as stand out as the first rush hourm is a been more complex and sometime non sense , but it turn out funny because of that , comedy scene here wo n't be as class as the first , but they did add alot hk style in here one which first one is lacking , great cast in this set , however still lacking at some element of worthy 5 star , so i hoped the third one will be best in the series
