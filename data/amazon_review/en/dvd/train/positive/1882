holo mai pele this spectacular and powerful singing and dance performance ( and the excellent commentaries ) telling the story of the fire goddess , pele , and her sister hiiaka , gives deep insights into hawaiian culture and religious belief and is wonderful to watch . for me it helps keep alive memories of my own visit to hawaii and the volcanoes national park . should be of interest to anyone who loves traditional dance and/or mythology .
