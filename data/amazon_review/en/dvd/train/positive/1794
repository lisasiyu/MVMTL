masterpiece i am continually amazed at the huge variation in people 's tastes . someone can give a 1 star rating and the next a 5 star rating for the same film . i can be touched by a film so deeply and yet the person sitting next to me feels nothing . i guess it proves how different we all are . & quot ; the sacrifice & quot ; touched me . i would rank it amongst the best 5 films i have ever seen . the film is mysteriuos , haunting , slow paced , impecably filmed and acted . so many images remain in my mind . the woman who breaks down and has to be pacified by a tranquilizer , the haunting music associated with the witch that permeates throughout the movie , the long take as the house is burned etc etc . this is a truly great masterpiece . what a shame tarkovsky died so young
