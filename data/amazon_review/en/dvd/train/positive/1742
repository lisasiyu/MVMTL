very unusual for hollywood i finally bought this movie recently and watched it last night and all i can say is ... .. fantastic entertainment ! forget all the bad reviews in the press when the movie was in cinemas , this film is very good indeed . if you like non stop action and i really do mean from start to finish , and if you like cgi special effects , and explosions , and weapons , and monsters etc , then you will love this movie . it 's a simple tale of good vs evil , nothing more nothing less . it is pure entertainment , great fun , great value at under six quid and it 's a film you will want to watch again , trust me
