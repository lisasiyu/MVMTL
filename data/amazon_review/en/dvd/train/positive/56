suprisingly good , much better than i thought wow ! this was a pretty decent romantic comedy . we had this in our collection for months ( possibly years ) and never watched it . we decided to watch this film on a whim . i have to say that it was better and ever funnier than i thought it would be . monica potter is great in her role . it 's a sweet movie that actually does n't do to much guy bashing ( the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies ) . i am also a big fam of henry thomas , and he is great at as well . i wo n't go into the plot here , as many others already have . but what i am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres ( sweet home alabama & 13 going on 30 ) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention . the other thing that must be said is , with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 ( and over 18 ) , why is n't monica potter more famous than she is . she can easily be the next julia roberts , or meg ryan . julia has 2 kids and meg has just hit the wall , it 's time for a beauty like monica potter to get into the very lucrative romantic comedy genre . here 's hoping she gets a better agent before it 's to late . cute movie , with a good heart . definetly made a date night at home wonderful . -mark ( for the record 32yrs old , straight and yes i enjoyed this movie )
