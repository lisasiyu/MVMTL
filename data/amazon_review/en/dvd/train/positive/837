i thought i knew a lot about the movie ... ... but the materials criterion put together for this great two disc set shed new insight and light to one of the greatest chambara films ever made . thank you , criterion , for taking my email ( and who knows how many others ) seriously and for bringing this pristine and wonderful dvd transfer of a true classic . this movie should be in every serious cinephile 's collection , and i highly recommend this two disc set
