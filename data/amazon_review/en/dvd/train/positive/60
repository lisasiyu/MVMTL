still a lot of laughs in this old thing ... jane fonda is best taken on screen in small doses , and the presence of the ace funny girl lily tomlin and the sexpot-on-the-outside , good-girl inside dolly parton in supporting roles help this project immensely . my favorite actor in this one , however , is dabney coleman as the evil boss . there are a few excesses , including a marijuana scene which rings false for this trio of co-workers , but the overall experience is just good fun for a couple of hours .
