hillraious when i first saw an episode of little britain i really did n't know wheather to laugh or turn off the tv . this series has a very bad habit of growing on you and then before you know it you are completly hooked . you are completly hooked when you start saying ... '' yeah ... , but no , but yeah ... '' to people . some of the characters are a little out of left field , but that is what i love about biritsh comedy . so politicaly uncorrect and full of dirty humor . sit down and enjoy the ride ... .
