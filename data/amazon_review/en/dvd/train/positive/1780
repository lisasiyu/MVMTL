jim west was my first martial arts instructor as a teenager , i first became interested in the martial arts by watching james west ply his trade in this series . although his defensive and offensive moves now look phony and ineffective , 42 years ago they completely captured my attention and imagination . initially , i tried my hands and feet at a number of martial arts styles before settling on john mcsweeney 's version of kenpo karate . ( john was one of ed parker 's first black belts . ) i was the head instructor at his school , self-defense unlimited , in elmhurst , illinois , for over 20 years , eventually earning a 7th degree black belt . as editor of the american kenpo karate association newsletter , i wrote many articles on the martial arts , as well as two books that are sold on amazon . and , of course , i learned the value of working out every day and pushing my body to its limits -- and beyond . the bottom line is that wild wild west truly had a profound influence on my life . and as this dvd set shows , it was also one of the most entertaining programs to ever hit the tube
