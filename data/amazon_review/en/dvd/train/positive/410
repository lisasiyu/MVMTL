yes it really is one of the best shows on television . this is one of the best medical shows to come around in a while . and i am actually learning some medical facts from this show . i love all of the actors on the show especially hugh laurie and omar epps . they are both so taleneted ! ( not to mention hot ! ) and the humor in the show is just wonderful . it really keeps the show interesting . the interaction between the characters is also very important , dynamic and well developed i think . the stories are also well written , well acted , and well developed in my opinion . i find each case fascinating and i love to watch as each one unravels . it may be somewhat formulaic but i feel it 's a formula that works ! i really enjoy watching this show . i almost always laugh at one or more of dr. house 's antics/jokes/pranks/runs and i am always trying to figure out just what will happen next . i think this show is enlightening , educational , humorous , entertaining , emotional & even inspirational at times . i give this show and this particular season 5 big stars . i hope this show continues to air for a long time to come . it is definitely one of my current favorites . if you have never seen it you really should . i really think you will like it . this is one of the best medical shows ever in my opinion . house rocks
