i love gilbert ! my favorite film of all time . i have the original dvd but bought this one purely for the bonus material , which , as far as i 'm concerned , is worth every penny . new interviews with all the main characters , including johnny depp . interesting commentary from lasse halstrom and peter hedges if you like to know the ins and outs ! ! ! money well spent
