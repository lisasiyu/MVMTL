good history in the balkans i was stationed in the balkans and thhat 's where i saw this movie for the first time . hearing about the atrocities committed in bosnia and serbia frankly disturbed me , but seeing this movie gives you a visual of what life was really like in the balkans . i recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning what life is like in a war with no sympathy for a fellow human being . these mass murders were a travesty for all , but it is important to understand the history of this hatred that serbs , croats , and muslims had for each other in order to properly put into context these countries as they stand today , slowly trying to rebuild after such a cruel devestation of their homeland as well as their human spirit
