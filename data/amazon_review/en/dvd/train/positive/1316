seen it , own it , love it i have been a huge fan of judy garland 's for years and this is one of my favorite movies of hers . even though she does n't sing in it , it wo n't matter , you will see her as an actress , which was what she wanted to be , not just a voice . it is subtle in the love story and story itself . boy meets girl , boy takes girl out to deliver milk , boy loses girl , boy finds girl , boy marries girl and boy leaves for war . vincente minnelli was the perfect choice for directing this , he uses new york as a character that works against them , but boy and girl make it through and marry . it is a lovely love story . robert walker is very sweet in it too . also judy has a crying jag in almost every one of movies , and this is the best/saddest crying scene . also look for roger edens ( her mentor ) playing the piano in the restraunt scene . it is a must for all judy garland fans and those who love a good love story
