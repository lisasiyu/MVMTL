ace of spies , king of hearts sidney reilly really was an international man of mystery and no-one really knew him including his wives and fellow spies . sam neil was incredible as reilly . he showed a man who was elegant , charming and yet so ruthless you could almost see the ice in his veins . he does n't have a problem with killing and he does n't have a problem with leaving an incompetent agent behind either . he was a womanizer who could be the ultimate romantic in one scene then simply walk away in the next . one of the most touching scenes in the series is when reilly 's wives and sweethearts all clamor for news of him . he 's treated some of these women horribly . one he 's turned into a hopeless drunk but they still ca n't get enough of him . in another scene , one of his conquests calmly faces death rather than betray him . after her death reilly , the series implies , carries her earrings , the only thing he has left of her on him for the rest of his life . reilly has been called the grandfather of the jame bond character because by the time young ian flemming came along reilly was a legend in the british spy world . flemming denied this but reilly 's relationship with his spymaster is very reminiscent of bond and m and of course there all those women . everything about this series is great . the acting is all top notch , the costumes are perfect , the music , especially romance of the gadfly , reilly 's theme is unforgettable . this series came on tv when i was a kid and i would rush home every week to get all my homework and any other chore done so i could watch reilly in peace . it was worth the trouble then and it 's worth it now
