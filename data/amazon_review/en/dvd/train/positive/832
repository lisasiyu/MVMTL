stonewall jackson 's way perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done . mr. maxwell 's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable . mr. shaara 's novel provided a great resource and mr. maxwell gave the visual display its magic . the depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves . mr. duvall gave a performance expected of his talents . mr. lang provided the quintessential `` stonewall '' in all his intense humanity and passion in faith . for the lover of history , the detail is exceptional . it may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time , this is the film where you can . admirers of `` stonewall '' will especially appreciate this film . those unfamiliar with `` stonewall '' will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man . his intensity still shines forth more than a century later . it is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end . in addition , the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb . i had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and i am very pleased with the result that has survived in this dvd edition . it was best on the big screen for the sense of scale and epic feel but let your imagination go back and come ride with stonewall .
