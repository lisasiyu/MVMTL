talk about values ! somew movies just have 'values ' and the original the four feathers is one of them . feathers is set in england and the sudan about ten years after the mahdi killed general gordon . in fact , seeing charlton heston in khartoum would be a good lead-in to 4 feathers.the plot revolves around four friends , all young officers in the same regiment and all heirs to an aristocratic military tradition heavy on the memory of the crimean war ( see the original `` charge of the light brigade '' film ) . three men boldly go to the sudan with general kitchener 's expedition . one chickens out and resigns his commission , losing the woman he loves in the process . to redeem himself , he goes to the sudan on his own and must help his former comrades . the story is well-explained , well-paced and has great values of timing , editing , and direction . the technicolor and the score are both excellent . 4 feathers is a cut above other british productions of the period in terms of technical quality ! feathers also exemplifies the best values of the victorian uk upper class -- belief in country , honor , loyalty , heroism , and sacrifice . the remake is a pathetic immitation of this original , which did not need a remake , now or ever ! a must-see and a great addition to any dvd collection
