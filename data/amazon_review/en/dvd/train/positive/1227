excellent oscar worthy movie ! i think that tsotsi was a very moving and inspirational movie ; very worthy of the oscar and all the awards that it won . it is so refreshing to see a movie that is n't marred by all the gliz and glam of hollywood . well done mr. chweneyagae and cast . we hope to see more of you in the future
