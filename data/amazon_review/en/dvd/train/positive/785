brilliant , season after season unfortunatly southpark above seison 4 is not availlable in holland on dvd . so everytime a new season is released i rush to have it shipped from abroad . this season was really worth the waiting , again . as always the makers of southpark succeed to brilliantly mock society , recent events and stereotype the american way of life . `` beef '' between a south park dancing crew and the boys , the man-child michael jackson with a child on his own moves into soutpark , people coming in from the future to work who somehow make you wonder what that reminds you of , the unevitable and hypnotising attraction of wall-mart , the quest for ratings of rivalling tv shows , paris hilton with her own stupid spoiled whore product and al always many , many of cartmans brilliant , ignorant , blunt , shameless , rude , spoiled , respectless behaviour . to put it short : hilarious . but be careful ! do n't watch this if a naked cartman might upset you
