one of the better poker dvds , just a little boring this dvd is pretty good , but the reviews i had read led me to believe i was really going to get an amazing batch of pro secrets . the dvd is good and she does tell some things that you probably have n't heard anywhere else . i am speaking specifically about her ideas she got from her conversations with the fbi and her tips on how to deal with a maniac at the table . i really thought those two areas were exceptional . it always seems like common sense after you hear it , but she really does clear a lot of things up and does a good job of providing a lot of information . a few downsides to mention : she discusses a lot about tells and sizing up an opponent . i only play online , so this stuff did n't help me . also , when she discusses a tell , she performs it herself as she talks about it . when lederer discussed tells in his dvd , he had actors play them out in a scenario , which i thought was both entertaining and more helpful to remember . the dvd never leaves a poker table with her just talking -- which decreases the desire to watch it a lot of times . had she ventured into the casino a few times to show a hand or something to change things up a little , i think it would have been better . basically , the dvd gets a little boring after watching it a time or two . wrapping up this review , you have annie duke sharing her thoughts on how to take care of business at the poker table . it might not be the most entertaining dvd you ever buy , but there is some good information on the dvd . definitely worth the price to have a pro player give up 90 minutes of their time . if you only play poker online , you can skip this one and wait for her online poker dvd . it should be a better choice . if you play some live poker , i think you 'll definitely want to know the information on this dvd . it could really make you more dangerous at the tables .
