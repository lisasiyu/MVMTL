superb just in case the preceeding reviews do n't settle the question , i 'll add my unqualified rave to the list . the subject matter of this film is important for many reasons and is equally full of dramatic potential - this movie makes the most of both . the screenplay is constructed like a beethoven symphony - logical , constantly moving forward , boiling with energy . the script , presumably , is based on the original transcript of the conference . the acting - well - how can one praise it enough ? the human drama - the constant interplay of personal politics , intellectual fencing , bestial attitudes and genuine emotional reactions to the subject matter being discussed - it 's captivating from first to last . and the last scenes are superbly poignant - the final intimate focus on both heydrich and eichmann as shallow men and profound monsters , the use of schubert ( as both reference and musical score ) to underline the moral desolation and irony at hand , the final roll call to enumerate the sober injustice of the participants ' ultimate fate . this is yet another hbo movie which raises the bar for american cinema , proving that one can still make a great statment on film without either large budgets or avant garde methods . i can watch this over and over and always get something new out of the experience - which , of course , is the very best recommendation for actually purchasing a movie on dvd . buy it and watch it often
