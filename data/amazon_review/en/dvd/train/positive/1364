great series i hated to see this series cancelled . it was great , different from all the other shows out there . thankfully it is out on dvd , with episodes that were not aired on t.v . i like to think of the 12 episodes a a mini seroes of sorts . although it does leave the watcher wanting more , it sort of ties itself up nicely
