hard to resist due to good performances ... i 'm not a big fan of tom or demi , and jack even wears out his welcome in some films , but not here . the supporting roles are superbly done , the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end , and when this shows up on cable tv i almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so . here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict , and that reflects a lot of real life in the usa during the past four years . i enjoy the script , because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force .
