as great a tour as the two albums it was promoting . the 90 's quadrilogy of achtung baby , zooropa , the passengers ( released under that psuedonym ) and pop are the last daring albums of u2 's career . this concert footage parodies not only u2 's celebrity , but celebrity in general . with banks and banks of television moniters decorating the stage , the band was mocking it 's own ubiquity . sadly , they have now become everything they were making fun of on this tour
