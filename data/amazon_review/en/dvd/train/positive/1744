moving the occasion of this concert was momentous , and what better way to celebrate than with beethoven 's magnificent ninth symphony and its customized `` ode to freedom '' . i grew up on bernstein 's `` young people 's concerts '' and have had a special place in my heart for him ever since . it was startling for me to see him looking sickly at this concert . but in spite of his obvious physical discomfort , he threw himself into the music with full passion , sometimes conducting with his whole body - dancing and jumping at times - and pulled off a heroic performance
