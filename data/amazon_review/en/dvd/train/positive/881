an excellent suspense/thriller ( and baroness curtis is hot ! ! ! ) this is a very good suspense/thriller about a mother played by jamie lee curtis who abandoned her family and now she wants custody and access to her sons . ms. curtis gives a sensual and yet chilling performance in this movie as the sociopathic mother who will not stop at anything to achieve this goal . ms. curtis ' father is tony curts who is hungarian just like my father was and i must say they do make beautiful daughters from that country . this movie rocks and so does ms. curtis who is now a baroness in real life
