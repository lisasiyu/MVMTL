the best volume yet this volume of mai hime is definitely my favorite so far . there 's tons of action , some really nice plot twists and drama to go along with it . i wo n't give out any spoilers but if you have been watching mai hime and have been a bit bored or hesitant to continue watching this set of episodes really comes through on what we 've all been waiting for . my only gripe is that it has taken the series this long to reach its potential but i 'm glad i stuck with it
