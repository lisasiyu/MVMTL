best lesbian film ! ! ! i 'll keep this review short and sweet , it has it all and in my opinion is the best lesbian film ever made . it 's one movie that made cry and made me laugh and left me wanting more at the end . all of the actresses were fantastic , my particular favourites were vanessa redgrave and chloe sevigny . these were no cheesy performances which unfortunately are common in many lesbian movies , and it 's a movie you can watch over and over again . worth any amount of money
