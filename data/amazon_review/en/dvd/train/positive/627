fun for the whole family ! dan zanes has written catchy music , and the videos are really fun . my 3 year old toddler really enjoys them when he sees them on disney , so we bought this dvd . while the concert portion is n't that great ( he got bored ) , the videos were for songs we 'd not seen and he will ask for `` dan zanes '' so we 'll put the dvd in and sing , dance and just have fun with it
