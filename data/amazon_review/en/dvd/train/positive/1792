if you 're a fan get the aussie edition ! ! ! ! i love this movie and i ca n't really add anything else to the reviews already posted . but i will say if you love this movie get the region 4 version from australia . yes you will need a region-free dvd player but it is well worth it . i found one for $ 35 that i can honestly say is one of the best pieces of electronic equipment i have ever owned . i can watch any movie i want without the powers that be telling me what i can and cannnot watch based on my geography . the previous poster is incorrect . there are scenes that have chopped . part of one can be seen in the trailer . nothing was taken out that will muddy the plot . but i have to ask miramax , why , at a short 90 minutes , would you bother taking out more of the fun ? and i truly have a dislike for the voiceovers done to change aussie references to american . do n't underestimate the viewing audience miramax ! if we are going to watch this movie , most of us will look up any words or phrases we are n't familiar with . thats part of the fun . there are 2 versions of this film available in oz . there 's the standard version and the pool room edition . it comes complete with a fuzzy slipcover to imitate a pool table , a lovely keep case with pictures of the cast , sheet music to `` we 're goin ' to bonnydoon '' , and a top 10 list of the kerrigans best deals from the trading post . ahhhh , the serenity
