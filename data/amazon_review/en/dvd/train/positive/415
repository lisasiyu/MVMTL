i had no idea wow ! i had no idea that people could be so close-minded and prejudiced -- and about a movie for crying out loud ! i mean people on here are saying that they would never date a person just because he/she liked this movie . and this from a reviewer who called this movie racist -- talk about hypocrite ! quite frankly , i thought this movie was hilarious . the acting is supposed to be life-less . the movie is supposed to be uneventful . but if you pay attention to the nuances , the slight glances , you might understand a bit more . for instance , when napoleon is carrying the chickens to their new cages and he puts them in , he does so with the utmost care and then , he looks around at the chaos and filth that these chickens are forced to live and runs from the coop at top speed . for all the dirt and aggravation of working on the chicken farm he gets paid $ 1 an hour . now who ca n't think of other people in our country who have to deal with that in a real-life scenario ? i am not going to get philosophical about the themes of this movie because in my opinion you either get this movie or you do n't , either you are a literal or figurative thinker , either you can enjoy things that have a circular pattern or you are more linear . the point is you do n't have to like this movie . no one is forcing you to jump up and down with glee ! you also do n't need to be so spiteful to those of us who do like it . liking this movie does not mean i do n't like other more classic/mainstream comedies . young frankenstein , the birdcage , the producers , the wedding singer etc are all great movies and great comedies . napoleon dynamite is just one more that some people in enjoy . so lighten up
