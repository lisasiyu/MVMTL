beauty and the beast ! the most touching romance of all the disney princess collection this si without a doubt the most moving of all the disney princess movies i 've seen . the ending of this movie had me in tears . when i first saw this movie i though the beast really had died and it was too late for him and then it turned out that belle 's love for the beast brought him back to life and broke the evil spell that was cast on him by the enchantress . the ending could n't have been more perfect . i 'm so glad to own the dvd . the picure and sound quality is perfect . i now have the entire princess collection on dvd . thanks amazon for carrying these out of print titles
