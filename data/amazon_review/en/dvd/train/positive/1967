the clash of two cultures ! kaufman 's adaptation of michael crichton 's japan-bashing potboiler is a realtively light approach , a simple buddy-cop movie featuring a pair of entertaining star performances . in spite of the fact the novel 's alarmism about the dangers of a dominant japan would soon be undercovered by a mellow script that confers much more importance to the opposite views between eastern and western worlds around a lot of issues , the director muted the xenophobic material that had made the book so terrific and brutal , transforming it into an interesting film , whose plot is nourished by great visual effects and the stunning differences between both cultures , with sean connery working out as the common link between two ways of life with a great doses of suggested violence and alarming use of the technology to create unexpeceted accusations . yet sean connery makes a very credible performance , as the detective , the script seems uncapable to surmount the anecdothic character of good guys and bad guys , and the ominous presence of the japanese mob with pretensions of noir film , the picture leaves us a bitter taste , because even if there are good sequences , the whole material promised best best and major intentions .
