soylent green - pure fantasy or potential reality my watching this film resulted from a conversation with a friend beginning with politics and spiraling down to the future of our world . the premise of the film was disturbing to say the least . i have never been a true fan of charleton heston who in my opinion always has overacted . however , edward g. robinson seemed as comfortable playing this character as he has been in the many different roles he has played . his performance was truly heartfelt , bringing to mind the current debate on `` ending one 's own life with dignity '' . i shutter to think that this is life as it should be though . but robinson 's character acted on the decision with the counterfeit courage and ultimate hopelessness that accompanied it in such a way that you could very well empathize with him . i found the other actors to be somewhat bland . perhaps this was acting at that point in time , but some actors can make the most of roles and others can not . the story line was unique , but the script was lacking . a re-make today by steven spielberg might be worthwhile seeing . perhaps the most striking element i took from this film was an unshakeable chilling and unsettling feeling that this could very well be our world if we do not wake up
