fans of woody allen will like it this was a pretty good woody allen film packed with well known celebrities . woody allen is playing a novelist named harry who written books based on people he knowns . he does n't tries much to disguise them and upsets his friends with his tales . there are funny moments when the movie segues to his fictional characters . my favorite is the one with demi moore . the one with billy crystal is pretty funny too . in harry 's real life i got a kick out of cookie the goodhearted prostitute .
