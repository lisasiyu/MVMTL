found in translation this noam chomsky speech on dvd is , as usual , enlightening . mr chomsky documents the facts , the truths , and his knowledge of terrorism researched over the past years . this speech and the bonus interview with the harvard audience all point out to to us how easily manipulated each of us are when we passively `` believe '' what we are told by our government , rather than seeking to `` know '' the facts ( or simply ask , `` wait , is that statement true ? '' ) . mr chomsky explains patiently , that facts are important . words and meaning can not be negotiated by idealogical and political spinners .
