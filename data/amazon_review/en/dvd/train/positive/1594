kids love numbers my students love numb3rs . they tell me they would have never watched this at home if they had not been introduced to it in my class . they are very interested in `` non-school '' applications of math and since they catch the `` bad guy '' every week , i consider this character education . you see , i teach in a secure juvenile detention facility
