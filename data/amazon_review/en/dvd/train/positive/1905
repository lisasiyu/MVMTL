newman and woodward - what else can you ask for ? terrific movie - newman and woodward sizzled . my husband and i watch this and we both think it 's one of the best romantic yet gritty movies ever made . each character/actor is a gem and the story is timeless . the only one i might like more is cat on a hot tin roof with paul newman and elizabeth taylor . same genre - great performances , great scripts , family realities
