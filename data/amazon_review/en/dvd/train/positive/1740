greatest 70s crime , tough guy show the 70 's get a bad rap . they brought us disco and sideburns but also spawned great movies & television . sanford & son , archie bunker , happy days , the jeffersons and , yes , the rockford files . man i loved this show . garner is a guy 's guy , no blown dry hair like chips or magnum pi . just a tough guy doing his job as a pi . the slew of great characters ( angel sticks out ) are a precursor the law & order franchise . and who could forget the cheesy theme song
