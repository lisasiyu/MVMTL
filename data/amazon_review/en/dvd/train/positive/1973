vintage crosby at the height of his wartime fame , bing crosby plays a hip young catholic priest who arrives to help a troubled parish struggle back to its feet . of course , what passed for young and hip back then , in this lily white , family-friendly comedy-drama may seem pretty silly these days -- bing is convincing , though , as he use his suave social skills to listen to and help out those in need . veteran scene-stealer barry fitzgerald plays the doddering , crusty old irish priest who runs the church before crosby 's arrival ... the rest of the supporting cast is n't as strong , but the film still has its charms . mostly it 's just a great chance to observe crosby at his most magnetic and self-assured . the film also previewed hits like & quot ; swinging on a star & quot ; and bing 's version of & quot ; too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra , & quot ; both of which are longtime favorites
