just a cute , romantic escape ! forget about trying to take this film seriously - just let yourself go and have fun ! it 's billed as an ashley judd film , and she 's great , but truly the whole key hinges on the chemistry between ashley and hugh jackman , who is absolutely adorable in this film ! they are magic together . the premise is kind of weird and hard to believe , but as i said , just have fun with it ! greg kinnear is good , too , but the way , as is ellen barkin . but hugh makes the film
