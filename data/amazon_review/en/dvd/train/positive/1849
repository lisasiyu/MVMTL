super challenging workout i have been using other advanced balance ball workouts for a few years now , but was humbled during phase i , the least difficult routine . i am now able to complete all the exercises and improve a little each time i do the workout . phase i will continue to challenge me just by adjusting my position on or near the ball . i do n't see how anyone could outgrow this dvd . adam is just amazing in phase 2 and 3 . as with his other dvds , i love that adam provides form pointers but does n't chatter endlessly throughout the routine . i also appreciate that he does n't count every rep
