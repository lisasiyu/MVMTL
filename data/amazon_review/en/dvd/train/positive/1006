eyes like olives ... this film is either the stupidest movie ever made or one of the best . i laughed for the first 30 minutes , virtually without stopping . the rest of the film is also very good , i was just tired . the concept of taking an old cliched film and morphing it into a spoof of the entire genre is brilliant and very well executed here . hope that they release a sequel .
