memories this is one of the better movies i 've seen in quite awhile . it is a love story , but not your typical love story . the love story is in fact framed inside the paradigm of a woman who is suffering from alzheimers . the biggest selling point of the cast is ms. rachel mcadams . i saw her in wedding crashers and i 've been anxious to see more of her work . she is gorgeous and she pulls of a fabulous performance in this movie . i predict her as one of hollywood 's up & coming stars ( at least i hope so ! ) . for a guy whose father suffers from alzheimers , this movie really hit home . an interesting facet of the film is that it covers the period of when the characters are very young ( their courtship ) and the period of their golden years . this is a must-see movie , even for people who do n't normally care for `` mushy '' movies . in a single word , this story is unforgettable .
