hilarious sleeper comedy it is n't much of a surprise that `` dick '' did not garner much of an audience when it was released in 1999 on the 25th anniversary of nixon 's resignation . a few years earlier oliver stone 's unintentionally comic `` nixon '' laid a box office egg as well . this hilarious film deserves to be seen because it is just a laugh-out-loud riot . the plot involves two oblivious teenage girls ( kirsten dunst and michelle williams ) who form a friendship with nixon and are employed as his dogwalkers . all goes swimmingly until they unearth tapes in the oval office that reveal that nixon is mean to his dog . the gloves come off at this point . no man who can be mean to his dog deserves to hold the highest office in the land . dunst and williams are bubblingly hilarious as the girls . dan hedaya does a dead-on hilarious rendering of nixon . alot of amusing cameos including will ferrell , harry shearer , and dave foley . great period soundtrack , too . i saw this film originally at a repertory house on a double-bill with `` all the president 's men '' . guess which film left a more lasting impression
