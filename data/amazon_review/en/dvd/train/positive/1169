brilliant , riveting ... but not quite & quot ; complete & quot ; ? ? the bottom line is : every jam fan should own this immediately - the quality/range of the material included on this amazing 2-dvd set is awesome ... but as much as love all the tv clips , archival footage ( esp the cool & quot ; meet the jam & quot ; piece ! ) , live segments , and videos , i do wish they would have included the video version of the jam 's final single , & quot ; beat surrender & quot ; which i sometimes would see on early mtv - it 's really polished and exciting , oh well ... and also , where is the stunning , raw set they did on abc 's early 80 's late-night & quot ; fridays & quot ; show , etc . these omissions are the only reason why i docked it one star - since it 's really not & quot ; complete & quot ; but for any jam fans , even casual ones , this is a definite must-have keeper dvd you will go back to again and again ! ! makes you feel nostalgic and even a bit sad for a time lost in pop/rock music , never to be returned !
