one of the best movies i 've ever seen from here to eternity , where to begin ? this is probably one of my top 10 movies that i 've ever seen . i love it ! frank sinatra is wonderful in it ; montgomery clift is gorgeous , vulnerable , and brave in this movie ; burt lancaster is awesome , as everyone who has ever seen him could tell you . this movie shows a clear depiction of the soldiers at pearl harbor before it was bombed . the book is a totally long , obnoxious book , towards the end i only read the quotations . the movie totally changed the book and made it wonderful . this is a classic , and will be for the rest of time
