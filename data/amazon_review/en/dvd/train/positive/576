hilarious , inspirational , funny - with a real depth & world-wide appeal ! , this movie was superb . i wish it was available in pal ( not just us/canada 's ntsc format ) . i was both inspired not only with it 's hysterical , insightful humour , but with it 's global appeal . it brings out themes that everybody can relate to , not only the diverse and often lovable flaws in families , but personal problems and insightfully familiar life themes . the movie has great wit and side splitting humour . it 's such fun to watch and this man is a star ! he really should be more widely recognised world-wide , a fantastic film that will leave you feeling inspired and wanting to watch more of this wonderful character . time to come and do a show in south africa too ! what a talent ! ! !
