one of the best this is one of the best live dvd 's ever . some of the songs are more impressive on this dvd than on their studio cd counterparts . the atlanta symphony youth orchestra is incredible and the arrangements of the songs are exceptional . the behind the scenes extras are very entertaining and enlightening . the crowd has great energy , as does the band who are getting even better with age . video and audio are high quality with a really good 5.1 mix . there are n't many concert 5.1 mixes that i 've liked but they got it right on this one
