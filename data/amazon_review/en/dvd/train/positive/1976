ridiculous but entertaining this movie followed its cover synopsis to the letter . lots of hot young asian ladies doing martial arts . actually , the techniques are so ridiculously gracious that they are great to watch . where else do you see cinematic application of wushu moves , which are martial arts gymnastics cultured entirely away from combat application . i guess that 's what makes the ridiculous so enjoyable to watch . you see the typical long fist and other wushu moves performed beautifully . i 'm writing this paragraph due to the other somewhat negative views on the rape scene . after watching the girls culled by training over years ( a few drowned youngsters are even pulled from the surf ) , killed in testing by guards , culled again to half in the open dormitory scene in which each girl must kill another to leave the building , culled yet again to three in weaponed combat , and lots of males , guards and targets , killed by assassins , some reviewers think that a rape scene is just too darn much . that 's a reflection of our modern society of the disposable male and protected female - all under the guise of gender equality . apparently , it 's now socially acceptible to kill as many men as you want , especially on assassin assignment . this movie has at least two scenes killing a naked man during a massage . well , i suppose modern social trends on gender-specific violence will be driving future legislation .
