note to paramount : no sane person is going to pay more than $ 60 for a dvd set , ever wake up paramount ! take a cue from your sales on the sttng sets . now that you have finally come to your senses and dropped the prices on the sets to where they should have been in the first place , i would imagine that all of the hold-outs ( like me ) are now buying them . see , it works like this , 30 minute shows on dvd , for a season , have earned a market fair price of $ 25-35 . so , since star trek episodes are an hour long , that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $ 50-70 range . so , $ 60 is your sweet spot . you will be able to take in the obsessive fans with your initial insane pricing points , but everyone else looks at your current price tags , especially with the shoddy packaging that you are still foisting on us , and just laughs and waits for the inevitable price drop . so , do us all a favor and fire your marketing and sales people , drop the price to where it is supposed to be , and earn your sales . nobody sane is going to pay more than $ 60 for a season of an hour long/episode tv show on dvd , period
