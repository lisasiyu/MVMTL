far better than i expected if some one had told me this film would turn into a story of an actual war between nations , i would have watched it sooner . the reviews i had read for it made it sound like a rip-off of akira , and the first hour or so makes you think it just might be it . a group of friends who are in a sort of xtreme motorcycle sport find themselves in the middle of their nation aphrodia invaded by the nation of their enemy ishtar . they quickly find themselves under military rule , and have to deal with life changing in such a time period . the group eventually decides to do some guerilla action and attack an enemy tank that is always in their stadium . then , just as the tank is destroyed and reinforcements are coming up , and the hero is about to be run over ... a free io soldier fires a missile into the octo and destroys it . then the movie becomes a story of a nation fighting for their freedom , as the group joins the free soldiers who are fighting ishtar all the way back out of io . eventually the hero , at first sympathetic , is convinced to join forces . the final battle takes place in the capital of io , and what a climax it is . overall , the film boasts fine animation and retro 80 's anime design . the action is well done and the mecha designs even better , and the storyline is also exceptionally well done . you get a good sense of a population under foreign rule , and its good to see an anime exploring such depths . also , the politics of a nation in exile fighting for their return is equally unique . maybe its because i 'm a political nut , but i found it all interesting . if i had known i would have enjoyed this film , i would have watched it far sooner than i did . oh well ... i bought the dvd the minute i saw it . i 'm proud to own it . and thats my word
