we love little bear ! my 3 year old daughter loves little bear . it airs on noggin just in time for me to make dinner and it is her wind down time during the day . when she is feeling sleepy or just needs some quiet time , little bear always does the trick . the dvd is great with so many episodes . my daughter and i were more than happy with it . i would recommend this for any child between 2 and 6 . ( actually i catch my older kids watching sometimes too ! !
