as far as funny movies go ... while i think i much preferred the first movie to this one , i found this one to be pretty amusing . there were a few good moments where i found myself giggling , and then there were moments when i could totally relate to the feeling of never being good enough for the in-laws no matter what you do . some of the sexual innuendo was hilarious . the stuff with the kid was just stupid , but it was so stupid that it was funny . all in all , worth the time to watch if you are in the mood for comedy . it 's dumb , but in a good way
