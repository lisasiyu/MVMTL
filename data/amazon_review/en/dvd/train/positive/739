chomsky views on current events this documentary shows bits and pieces of a big speaking engagement of chomsky and two talks he is giving to activist groups . the only thing was , the documentary was kind of short - like 1 hour and 10 minutes . but it was good . here are some highlights : - when the russians invaded afghanistan , the u.s. press gave sharp criticism to the russians . however , since the u.s. press has a u.s. audience why does n't the press tell americans what is happening with their tax dollars and what they can do to fix their mistakes . an example at this time was u.s. funding for death squads in el salvador and indonesian funding for the massacre of timorese . it is cowardly for our criticisms of russians , when we as americans have no control over them , but we do have control over what we do and ourselves . - the media was most free during the mid nineteenth century , this was before media started getting advertising in it . once advertising started to happen , media could not say certain things the advertisers did not like . - run up budget deficits by giving massive tax cuts that benefit the wealthy , then cut social programs . then eventually get rid of social security and public education . getting rid of public education and social security just eliminates solidarity and sympathy with others . - if your pension is tied up in stocks - stocks go up when people lose their jobs , that is against your own interests and all worker 's interests . this chomsky documentary was more entertaining than the previous made ones . if a person does not pay attention to foreign policy , they can still grasp the concepts and ideas that are presented in this documentary . this documentary provides plenty of ammo to help people think and get active . watch it and have house parties or let a bunch of politically passive friends watch it .
