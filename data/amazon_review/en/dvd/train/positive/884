the fresh prince has been a bad boy it only took me 8 years , but i was finally inspired ( by will smith recently filming `` i am legend '' right in my neighborhood ) to see enemy of the state . and it was a good 2 hours and 10 minutes of time well spent . will smith is on a roll ... has been on a big screen roll ever since bad boys ( 1995 ) . it seems that he always plays the same character : confident , smart talking , tough , funny . but the redundancy works ... every time . it worked in enemy of the state too . like a lot of other will smith movies ( `` independence day '' , `` men in black '' , `` i , robot '' , `` hitch '' ) , enemy of the state is a thoroughly entertaining movie that keeps you in your seat . it 's got a great story with some great actors . and post 9/11 , the subject of government surveillance is even more on topic . can anyone say , `` the patriot act '' ? enemy of the state is classified as a thriller . a thriller is supposed to be exciting , full of suspense , intrigue and mystery . enemy of the state does not disappoint . a worthy rental .
