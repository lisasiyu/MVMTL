excellent beginner video and much more i found this to be a valuable collection for my dance library . the first segment teaches what many instructors fail to teach- orientation and smooth transitions early , this video will guide you easily . transitions from left to right are created by teaching the pivoting of the foot almost magically , creating smooth and graceful dancing , no more boring dancer , learn to dance for all your audience , not just those facing you ! the cross step with use of the arms over the head and framing the head , taxsim which is much overlooked , hip pushes , beautiful traveling hip circles , undulations.the second segment teaches a funtastical drum solo , easy to learn . it is easy to add to this choreography and make it more challenging.there is so much in this video , learn to flow gracefully or bump to the beat of the drum , let beautiful neon guide you into a spellbinding journey of this mystical dance . overall , i totally enjoyed the quality of this video and the only improvements i would make would be the backdrop or setting which needed color . learning from a video is easier in my opinion if the instructor faces a mirror or works at an angle and the student follows along . overall those are minor compared to all that is offered
