unjustly overlooked . lord of war ( andrew niccol , 2005 ) this one flew under the radar , or at least as under the radar as a much-hyped major hollywood production can . upon reflection , that 's not terribly surprising , given how strong a film it is ; good things , it often seems , never flourish in the sandy , sandy soil of hollywood . and niccol ( gattaca ) has created a good thing here . yuri orlov ( nicolas cage ) and his brother vitaly ( jared leto ) are arms dealers operating in the grey areas of the law . or they are until vitaly develops a rather nasty drug habit and goes into rehab , leaving yuri to fly solo -- just as the berlin wall comes down and the arms market takes off . yuri is being dogged by jack valentine ( ethan hawke ) , an fbi agent who 's sure he 's breaking the law . as an action movie , it 's kind of fun , interesting , a bit slow at times but watchable all the same . as a chronicle of the slow descent into corruption of a guy who 's just trying to make his way in the world , it 's incisive , well-done , witty , charming . however , the movie really shines as a survey of the political and economic structure of the world in the nineties . yuri orlov is the perfect character to allow niccol to ruminate on the general anarchic wackiness of a lot of different hot spots at the time . yuri traipses through the former soviet union and africa , and niccol follows with his camera , casting light on some very nasty characters who are thinly-veiled ( at best ) analogues of real dictators . it 's good stuff ; you probably did n't see it in the theater ( very few did ) , but you can catch what you missed then on dvd now . ***
