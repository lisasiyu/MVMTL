really great movie that is still fun like a lot of people , i remember this movie fondly from when i was younger , and this movie is still really fun . unlike remakes that are made now , this took a classic film and put its own twist to the story . the acting is good , but what really stands out to me is the sets and costumes , especially when they make it to the city . the entire scene when they are watching the people sing about green , red and gold is really cool to watch . the songs are also very memorable and really catchy . overall , this is a cool movie that can still be enjoyed by anyone , it is really a classic .
