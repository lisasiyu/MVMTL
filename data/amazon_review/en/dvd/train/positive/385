* are we living in a true democracy ? * i ask the question and ask that people open themselves up to the possiblity that some elections in the past have been stolen . i 'm not picking on either republicans or democrats as i 'm sure both sides have their shady dealings . i do believe that the information on this documentary as well as noam chomsky 's documentaries and gore vidal 's books are very telling . i question whether democracy is alive anymore and if it is too late in our life times to correct this . a stunning view of a behind the scenes look at the 2000 presidential election . much of the info in this documentary was not on the major news networks ... hmmm , i wonder why
