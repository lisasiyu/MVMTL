sneezes , sex and ham and cheese on rye this is a deliriously silly little movie , but it 's fun to watch . kim basinger utilizes her breathtaking beauty to its fullest as she discovers the joys of becoming human , from sneezing to sex to ham and cheese on rye with mayo . basinger 's comic timing carries the movie , and even the usually disposable dan aykroyd 's performance is comic and he and basinger have a good chemistry . there are some delightful sequences , e.g. , when kim has to discover how to kiss , her alien ally shows her films of several different types of kisses , and when she has to have sex , she does a sensual striptease replete with windblown hair and all . jon lovitz is around for comic relief as aykroyd 's bachelor brother , and it 's all mindless nonsense ; it 's also quite entertaining . basinger is a blast
