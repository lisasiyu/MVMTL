jim carey 's genius strikes again ! ! i love this re-telling of the classic dr. suess cartoon that everybody over 30 grew up with ! jim carey was born to play this role and ron howard 's direction is superb , as well as all the supporting cast ! great story-telling that will last for generations to come
