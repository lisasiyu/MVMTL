must-have for cards fans ! ! ! this dvd set has all 5 games with detroit , and games 5 and 7 of the mets series . of course , commercial free with great audio and video . world series victories do n't come around often , and this set offers a great way to preserve those memories . i have been watching replays of these games on fox midwest , but twenty years from now ( when the cards have wrapped up 5 or 6 more ws victories thanks to coach of the year 2021 albert pujols ) these games will still be preserved for me , long after they are regulars on cable tv . the bonus dvd is neat too , with interviews from many on the team . a lot of funny stuff , with people spraying champagne all over eachother while trying to interview . good , candid stuff that you do n't get to see during the course of a regular season . if you or your loved one is a serious cardinals fan like i am , this is a must have ! ! ! -dav
