terrific farce reminds me of richard bissell 's novel `` say , darling , '' a witty send-up of the process of launching a broadway musical suspiciously resembling `` the pajama game . '' woody allen 's vision here takes on an interface of commercial theatre , runyonesque gangsters ( though closer to the sopranos than `` guys and dolls '' ) and greenwich village intellectuals ( think about dave van ronk reminiscing about the san remo in scorsese 's `` no direction home '' or the lighter side of `` reds. '' ) . the john cusack character is how barton fink might have turned out if he had n't gone to hollywood .
