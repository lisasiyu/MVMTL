attention grabbing i throughly enjoyed this movie because of the plots twists and turns . bruce willis and brad pitt both delivered excellent performances and contributed much to the intrigue of the story . while this one might be a bit out there for the general public , i found it to be a white knuckle ride and could n't wait to get back on . probably not a `` first date '' kind of movie , but if you 're wanting a story that grabs your attention and then throws it down the stairs , along the lines of pulp fiction , this is it
