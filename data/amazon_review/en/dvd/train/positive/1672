a perfect gem of filmmaking this film is an artfully crafted vision of the old west . by any measure one of john wayne 's better movies . i really ca n't feature this movie being made with anyone else in the lead . he fits the character like a glove as a tough gnarled and aging rancher . roscoe brown is another inspired piece of casting as the sagely cook . his was a oscar caliber performance . in my book , this picture has bruce dern 's best performance as an evil doer . his psychopathic rustler is a flawless jewel . and despite these excellent qualities what really makes this film so good and sets it apart is it 's concept- cowboys herding cattle that are really boys , facing the harsh unforgiving environment of the old west and dealing with it as best they can . casting the cowboys they used a mix of hollywood child actors and kids that grew up on ranches and had riding and roping skills . this worked out incredibly well . the script is tight and the movie does not have one flabby moment . to top it off- the musical score is by john williams . all of these things converge to create a perfect gem of filmmaking .
