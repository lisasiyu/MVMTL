thunderball strikes big ! spectre is back , and 007 has got'em . this time spectre plots to steal two atomic bombs and hold the world for ransom ( a situation still very real for the world today ) . a bit underrated by some james bond movie fans , but i think it just gets better with age . sean connery 's personal favorite ! still has the right stuff as james bond . has by far the best looking bevy of bond girls ever to grace the silver screen ! claudine auger , is my bond dream girl as good-girl domino . lucianna paluzzi , lusciously evil as the first true bond femme-fatale ! adolpho celi , a scary and most formidable opponent . awesome production values , classic witicisms ( `` i think he got the point '' ) , spectacular underwater action , and another classic john barry score make this bond effort a total splash ! ****1/2 out of *****
