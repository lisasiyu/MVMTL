wb makes one grave mistake i am currently watching some of the episodes of this season , but if you watch the entire opening sequence of the dvd before selecting from episodes , play , etc , they give away the twist endings for a few of the episodes . for season 6 & 7 , please wb , put back the crypt keeper where you can select an episode
