words ca n't do justice for me , this film was about matt damon , a brilliant newcomer who came out of ( seemingly ) nowhere . i was floored by his performance - one of the best of the 20th century . of course he was supported by a fine cast - robin williams , ben affleck , and the loveable minnie driver , whose onscreen chemistry with damon was sizzling . matt is an emerald in a heap of cheap diamonds , and obviously a multi-talented guy - he co-wrote the screenplay as well as starred in it . well worth seeing .
