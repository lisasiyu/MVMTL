kudos to criterion i saw this movie years ago on vhs . this is the ultimate for collectors . lots of extra goodies ala criterion . beatifully remastered . i have a couple other roeg films released by criterion , and again criterion has come through with a quality product . if you 've seen this film and liked it than this is a must have . when i rented this on vhs , it was an unrated version , but this one has had some additional footage added . charlie s
