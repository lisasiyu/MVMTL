enjoyed ! ! ! i really enjoyed this dvd ... ... .. i recently bought the recent release of the ritual path after seeing some clips on nijole sparkis and fritz heede 's my space pages and really enjoyed the images and music so i thought i would give the illuminated manuscripts a try . i really thought it was well done and would have enjoyed it just for the music . i guess it depends on what you are looking for as to weather or not you will like it . i watched on a regular tv with a $ 100 dvd player and thought it was great . someone else may watch on a $ 10,000 tv and system and may still not be impressed . i looked at another dvd review that was mentioned and highly recommended by someone that did n't like this one , yet that dvd only had 2 reviews and not good.. so just a matter of taste and perhaps the digital age has made it very hard to impress a person . i feel the dvd does what it was meant to do , provide some relaxing music with some wonderful scenes , perhaps the title illuminated manuscripts explains the writings and emblems that appear in the video . perhaps if you are able to watch some clips you will know if it 's for you or even check out the more recent ritual path . i come from a rock music background and do n't feel that i 'm easily impressed but from my personal viewing i would recommend both the illuminated manuscripts or the ritual path . it 's been awhile since i have seen some of the other animated clips mentioned in some of the reviews here and admit some of what i remember they were great , but these do what they were meant to do just like chronos did years ago without the animation ... .
