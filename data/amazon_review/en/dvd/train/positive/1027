wow wow wow ! ! ! all i can say is wow , this is one tough ( but excellent ) workout . i am an intermediate to advanced level exerciser and incorporating this dvd into my routine is going to get me into the best shape ever . no question about that ! there is a short segment of ab work , and i would like to see more , but if you 're like me and do other things through the week targeted to your abs , you will be fine . five stars for jari
