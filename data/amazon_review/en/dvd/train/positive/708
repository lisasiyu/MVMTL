enduring classic even though this movie has some `` miles '' on it ... it never seems to be `` dated '' ..the story is still full of suspense ... and even though we have seen it several times..it never grows old . we live in a small fifth wheel..fulltime and this is one of the movies we both voted to take with us for those rainy days ! a `` must-have '' for anyone who loves movies
