`` always be closing ! '' glengarry glen ross is a superb drama directed by james foley ( at close range ) , and starring a powerful all-male cast including al pacino ( heat ) , jack lemmon ( grumpy old men ) , ed harris ( a beautiful mind ) , alan arkin ( edward scissorhands ) , kevin spacey ( american beauty ) , alec baldwin ( the aviator ) , and jonathon pryce ( pirates of the caribbean : the curse of the black pearl ) . the movie is an adaptation of the stage play written by david mamet , who also helms the screenplay to the movie version . the thing that drew me most to glengarry glen ross was the dialogue . and since i tried my hand at door-to-door sales , i felt very connected to the characters in the movie , especially sheldon levene , played remarkably by lemmon . the presentation made by alec baldwin in the beginning of the film about what it takes to be a salesman hit me harder than an iron fist . the movie is not just for salesmen ( even though i find it mandatory for anybody who 's considering a career in sales ) , but for everybody who appreciates real movies . recommended
