pleasant and satisfying film after watching too many critically acclaimed movies which left me at the final credits feeling like petrified wood , i 'm now allowing myself to rent and enjoy movies that i formerly shunned because they received poor reviews . happily , i 've progressed through that stage . i 've learning that what a professional critic likes and what i like do not always match . i really enjoyed this movie . i admit that some of the satisfaction i got from viewing this movie came from the sight of the young male actor 's attractive physique . at least it helped me understand the main character 's temptation . i could imagine myself in her place . if only life was fair , i would be . if you 're in the mood for light laughs , and a bit of poignancy , rather than the highs and lows of a dramatic roller coaster , this film will not disappoint
