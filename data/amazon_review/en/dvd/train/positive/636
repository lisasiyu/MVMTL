it 's all about halle berry ... a very good film , swordfish , brings to the screen the story of hacker who is hired by the underworld to break a bank code resulting in the release of millions of dollars . hugh jackman , halle berry ( who is gorgeous ! ) , john travolta and the rest of the cast , carry out their performances very well . the highlight of the movie has to be halle berry 's nude scene at the pool . in short , the setting , the plot , the dialogues and the music are all wonderful ! swordfish is a movie definitely worth watching , as it will surely provide for an evening 's entertainment !
