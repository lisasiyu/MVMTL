most excellent inane drivel bill s. preston , esq . and ted `` theodore '' logan totally rule in this bodacious movie extravaganza ! a time-traveling rock and roll tribute to that greatest of all lost bands , `` wyld stallyons '' ! the other reviews have pretty much said it all , although i must exclaim that : `` i do n't understand why people complain that this movie is inane . '' of course it is ! did n't you know that when you popped it in the video player or went to see it at the movie ? ! ? it is inane drivel from wall to wall , although there are some most excellent puns thrown in , such as napoleon spending his day in san dimas at a water-slide park called `` waterloop '' ... get it ? ... .waterloo ... p ? like i said , pretty much inane drivel , but i like it like that . ted theodore logan in his more pensive moments leans toward a proto-neo acting style which will thrill fans of the matrix series . people who complain about inane comedy are people who are n't funny themselves , and i hate people like that ! but fortunately for the future of the planet , unenlightened souls like myself can always invoke that core principle of peaceful planets everwhere ... be excellent to each other . and do n't forget to wind your watch !
