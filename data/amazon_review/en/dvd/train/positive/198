`` you are go for the moon . '' i agree with the space nerds yelling `` sananaigans ! '' over the footage from different missions being put in here to look like it was all from apollo viii . it kind of makes you feel ripped off . example : the space walk footage was actually from the apollo 9 mission ! ... or so i 've read . also as a person who knows very little about the space program i was disappointed in the lack of fact giving narration . the footage is breathtaking and i learned a lot , but i wanted more information and i wish they had put up a disclaimer telling when there were images not from the apollo viii mission . worth watching preferably on a large high definition television .
