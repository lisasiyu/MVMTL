inside the mind of the crooked politician this is an unusual movie , where the hero is also the villain . i wish modern people would see this movie just to understand the difference between the public perception of a powerful politician and the way he behaves in private . politics is a dirty game that muddies anyone who plays to win . it is a movie about how power corrupts everyone touched even indirectly by that power .
