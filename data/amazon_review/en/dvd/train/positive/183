heartwarming . satisfying . vindicating . heroic , i was n't expecting much when i dropped this 1998 movie into the dvd player ... there is a lot to commend itself . matt damon gives a convincing performance of a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer who finds himself with a big case on his hands just as he passes the bar exam ! danny devito is slimy , shady , sarcastic , and sleazy ( in other words , perfect devito ) as damon 's partner . the main story involves a poor family whose son is denied needed medical treatment for leukemia . the sleazy big insurance company has denied his claim and betting that they will not press the matter . they bet wrong ! our hero , guided by some unlikely supporters and a sympathetic judge ( dixon from alias ) , come to the rescue . the pieces fit together quite nicely . justice is served , bad guys are taken down , and matt damon establishes himself as an unlikely , unwilling hero and endears himself to the pretty girl in the process . nothing wrong with this story or this film . very delightful and satisfying in every respect .
