the human swamp ... i love frost , and its not just because it almost sounds like frog . `` frost '' is a great crime series , which , in stark contrast to almost every mainstream american detective show , refuses to glamorize either criminals or the people who pursue them . rather than wrapping up every crime into nice black and white labels or a tidy little paradox , `` frost '' leaves the viewer with a sobering sense for the dissonances and crises that afflict every the body politic . but what i love most is the wondering dismal grey denton atmosphere . i can almost imagine i 'm back in the swamp
