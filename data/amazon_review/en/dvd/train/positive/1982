a tour de force of great actors the cast alone makes this one of the great films of all time . the acting is superb , the characters are portrayed as likeable and keep you cheering for their cause . it is , perhaps , steve mcqueen 's greatest film right up to and including the best motorcycle footage ever at the end . charles bronson is never better . the action/drama is intense and builds quickly to a brilliant and moving finish . every movie affecionado will want this one for the memorable characters .
