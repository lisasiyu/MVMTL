kind of slow , but give it a go ! this movie starts off a little slow , but definately picks up pace . its a great 80 's movie and moreso timeless for anyone who has experienced love and heartbreak for the first time . it reminded me of my first high school romance . many scenes are quite comical , and cusack does not disapoint . worth watching , you are sure to give a chuckle or two , at least watch it to make fun of the 80 's fashion trends
