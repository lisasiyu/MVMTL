dark hero a down and dirty mel gibson is fantastic in this film . from his gravely voice , and the lack of a single smile throughout the film , he plays the part perfectly . porter is a man betrayed by his wife , his friend , and left for dead . the entire movie involves him trying to get the money that was stolen from him back . that proves to be not as simple as it seems , and soon corrupt cops , the mob , and japanese gangsters are all out for him . this one is worth the money
