seriously people this movie is funny other reviewers that dont get the humor and take this as a serious movie need to lighten up ! seriously this movie cracks me up and i dont get sick of it . i 've watched it several times and it still makes me laugh every time . if you are a stoner you 'll probaly `` get it '' a little better and be laughing at these two clowns as they do bust out tons of funny catch phrases , but it is what it is , a stoner comedy made for stoners to laugh at . if you like these type of movies this one is pretty original for what it is and definitely worth adding to your collection because it isnt one of those `` watch it once and you 're over it '' movies it stays funny
