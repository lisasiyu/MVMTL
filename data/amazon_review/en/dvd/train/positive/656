roaring biplane blast from the past ! my father took me to see this movie when i was a child of about six or seven . actually , he wanted to see it and he had to take me along . i did n't remember the plot , but i remembered the scenery and the music and the cool biplanes and dogfights . so , i finally bought this movie so i could watch it as an adult . i can empathize with those who say this movie is too long and moves too slowly . that said , i enjoyed it more than i thought i would . the airplanes are amazing . where did they get all these biplanes from ? the only other movie i 've seen that has such authentic looking biplane dogfights is `` wings '' , and that was made back in the 1920 's when biplanes were all over the place . the soundtrack by jerry goldmith fits the movie perfectly and adds mood where appropriate . i loved the `` intermission '' . it reminded me of a time when a movie was a real event . movies were so long that the movie itself gave you a break to use the bathroom . i saw this movie in a theater that was designed to allow perhaps a thousand people to watch a single movie on a huge screen , not some modern `` plex '' theater that has twelve little rooms where you can pay to see a movie with a bunch of strangers a few months before it 's out on dvd . so , it moves a little slowly by today 's standards , but it 's epic , and it 's interesting to watch peppard 's character slowly alienate himself from his squadron , and his lover , so that at the end they kill him off by giving him the `` privelege '' of flying an experimental aircraft .
