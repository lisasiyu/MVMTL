gross and funny as hell ! i finally got around to watching this movie . i had heard that this was a black comedy of the quality of `` saun of the dead '' . i wouldnt go that far , but i do give this movie top marks . ever since i saw `` serenity '' at the movies , and then started watching the tv series `` firefly '' i have been a big fan of nathan fillion . he is brilliant in this movie too . the premise is nothing better than the usual 80s horror flick , but that is part of its charm . the effects are gross , the `` heros '' are scared , the monsters are slimy . what more could you ask for ? well the answer to that is you want to be entertained . `` slither '' is a movie which does entertain
