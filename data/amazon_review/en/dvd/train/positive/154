a quiet , chilling masterpiece whether you 're drawn to suave action heroes tossing out wry quips while emptying machine-guns into charging hoards , or of nearly wordless , hours-long existential explorations of meaningfulness and nothingness , `` i 'm not scared '' will likely find in you a delighted new fan . for the subtitle-phobic : take a risk ! `` i 'm not scared '' is refreshingly original , quietly chilling , and continually surprising to the end . the cast , led by 10 year-old guiseppe cristiano , is uniformly solid , and the oscar-caliber photography is nothing short of brilliant . the smart , effective score never gets overly dramatic nor does it tip the audience as to how it 's `` supposed '' to feel . its quiet beauty merely serves to support and bind the elements of the story , while standing humbly in the background . i discovered this film quite by accident , having read no reviews , and now consider it to be my `` find '' of the year . i recommend `` i 'm not scared '' without reserve or hesitation to anyone who ever wondered what his or her parents really did to make their money
