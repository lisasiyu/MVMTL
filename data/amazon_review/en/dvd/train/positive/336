portrait of an artist as a young brazilian we all see different films , even when we see the same film . `` city of god '' is especially like that , with it 's linked stories that give multiple perspectives -- not unlike the linked stories used in postmodern novels . `` city of god '' gives us a story of crime , poverty , drugs , sex , homelessness , corruption , community ( in its own way ) , even odd bits of humor -- and a way out . a special feature on this dvd is the documentary `` news from a personal war '' which uses the same technique of multiple perspecitves in a brilliant effort to give a rounded view to a complex story of the drug war in rio . the movie i see would be titled `` portrait of an artist as a young brazilian '' played by alexandre rodrigues as rocket who narrates `` city of god . '' the dvd jacket says it so well : `` . . . a frail and scared young boy will grow up to discover that he can view the harsh realities of his surroundings with a different eye : the eye of an artist . '' i love the moment when his photos are discovered by the newpaper through a mistake and how that leads to rocket 's career as a journalistic photographer -- and his first hot shower , followed by his first sexual experience . this last part of the film is thrilling as rocket moves into a new world and then rockets between them . remember the lyrics that had a bouncing ball on top telling you what word to sing next ? just follow the bouncing ball here -- the words and story line of the young narrator as his heart 's wish comes true and he demonstrates considerable courage . -- janet grace riehl , author `` sightlines : a poet 's diary
