what could be more ironic than a deaf dj ? consumers love irony ! i can sum up this film in one sentence : djing , drugs , hummus and sex ... silence ... newfound appreciation for life . what makes this film great is not the fact that frankie wilde does drugs , rather , its how he does drugs ( see it and you 'll understand what i mean ) . same thing with his djing . the fact that he djs is well-and-good , but you have to see how he djs ( pre- and post-deaf ) . frankie is a special character and paul kaye nails this role ( as he says in the dvd extras , `` god , i 've waited a long time for this job. '' ) . speaking of dvd extras ... watch them . frankie the spokesmodel for oman whiskey , frankie on a cooking show , frankie on an interview with a news anchor , frankie 's rabbi ( played by paul kaye ) , among other gimmicks ... classic . in regards to credentials ... winner gen art film festival , winner u.s . comedy arts festival , winner toronto film festival . and the soundtrack ... exceptional club music . particularly , reflekt 's `` need to feel loved '' ( seb fontaine & jay p remix ) . i guarantee you will re-watch this film over and over again . maybe you 'll even take a step back and have a look at your own life ? note : this film is a work of fiction . it is a `` mock '' umentary . do n't be fooled . the fact that the directors and actors deliver such a compelling final product , where consumers actually believe it is real , is testament alone that this film is a keeper . please feel free to disagree with my opinion ; let us compare opinions , invite a few more points of view , and debate , like the humans we are .
