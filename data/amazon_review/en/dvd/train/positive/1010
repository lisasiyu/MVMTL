superb look at the emptiness and madness of stolen love written by playwright noel coward , directed by david lean , starring celia johnson and trevor howard , and set to the impassioned music of rachmaninoff 's concerto no . 2 , this is a story about two people living quietly dull lives , married to equally dull spouses , who suddenly find someone interesting to share a brief encounter with . this masterful film shows how hungry normal , ordinary people are for the feeling that life is exciting , and that there is someone who finds them interesting to share it with . the normal avenue for such a relationship would have been their own spouses ; but they are unable to find it there , somehow . so they find it one day , accidentally , illicitly , secretly , dishonestly , soul wrenchingly in a stranger . now these quietly dull souls become quietly desperate souls , as they realize that stolen love comes with a price , and that what had promised to bring them boundless happiness is instead bringing them more sorrow than they have ever known before . i found many parallels in this movie with other quietly desperate people that i know : friends of mine who have tried to find happiness illicitly , secretly , dishonestly in work , sex , alcohol , drugs , co-dependent relationships , etc . i think this movie has a powerful message for our times . it is not about a love relationship that was doomed because of a stricter social and moral code than we have today ; it is about the emptiness and madness of stolen love of any kind . i love the way the film ends , with repentance , forgiveness and reconciliation . this film is a timeless gem . waitsel smit
