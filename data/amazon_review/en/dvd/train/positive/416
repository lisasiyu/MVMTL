incredible only in this masterpiece can you find arnold schwarzeneggar saying `` i 'm not a pervert ! i just wanted the turboman doll , '' `` put the cookie down ! now ! '' and `` rock-'em-sock-'em jet pack ! '' along with classic moments like arnold busting into a radio station , kicking down the door and yelling like a madman to a frightened dj . parents , this is a must buy . you may be able to relate to it , but you 'll probably have more fun laughing at how ridiculous it gets ( you 're children will think you 're laughing at the broad humor ) . the fact that a parade features a working turboman suit complete with jet pack kills me just thinking about it
