greatest american hero - utter brilliance i live in the uk . hardly anyone i know has heard of this show - reason : uk itv only showed season 1 and some of season 2 on saturday mornings approx . 11am in 1987 and 1988 - quite a while after usa run . i am looking forward to buying the remaining seasons as well , very pleased indeed . now - if we can have seaon 1 of tv 's batman and all of street hawk on dvd - life will be better still
