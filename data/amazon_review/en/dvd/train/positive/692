a film for those who believe in `` the one true love '' to appreciate this story , you have to believe that two people can meet and quickly fall forever into forbidden love . that is what is at the heart of this film . if you ca n't accept that premise , the movie simply does not work . and what makes it throb with life for me are the excellent performances of jeremy northam and jennifer ehle whose mutual passion sweeps us along . paltrow and eckhart are a secondary love story here , but you never feel that they really care for one another . worth your time if you are a romantic . ok , i 'm a romantic . sue me
