more of an overall workout this is a good workout and you do work up a sweat even though this is n't really cardio ( i do this with 5 pound weights ) . there is minimal jumping- only when switching directly from a left-leg lung to a right-leg lung so this would also be suited to people who want an effective workout but are uninterested in high-impact exercise . i really like a lot of the exercises- particularly the 'bow and arrow ' . she has great exercises that you do feel quite quickly and there are n't loads of repetitions so this also keeps it intersting . most of the time i do n't specifically feel the exercises in my butt though . that is , i think this is more of a general workout , and not so much 'brand new butt'- the day after doing this i 'm not particularly sore anywhere , but overall tired . janis saffel has 'cute california charm'- some people like this , some do n't . some things i do n't like about this workout are a ) the music includes elevator music of familiar songs- such as red hot chili peppers and stevie wonder ; b ) she shifts her angle a good bit and does several exercises in quick succession at times ( warm up , etc. ) . i find the and speed increases the risk of having poor alignment so i focus on keeping feet facing forward so the exercise is properly done- not rushed and poorly aligned . i 'm sure if you 're familiar with these exercises this is not a problem ; c ) some floor stretches and ab work take the place of a cool down section . overall though , this is a good workout and one you can build on easily by increasing weights in your hands and adding weights on your ankles and waist
