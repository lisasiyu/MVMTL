great patriotic movie the stroyline of the screenplay is a little shallow , but the directing , acting , camera are all good , especially the stunt , the choregraphic design of the fight scenes are amazingly fantastic . the only problem i found in thai historical movie is the hairdo . almost every one of the male and female roles in this movie are with hairdos that only hairdressers could have done and with lot of gel used . but again , the alamo-like fighting scenes are so vicious and realistic just like what best korean movies could deliver
