get this dvd ! i am a second grade teacher and always looking for creative ways to supplement my lesson plans on the planets . children do n't easily identify with planets , since they are spheres that can not be seen in their daily lives . children usually respond to the colors , but never really connect with them . now , with `` my fantastic field trip to the planets '' the planets all have faces , personalities , and the undivided attention of my class . the show transforms the planets into memorable characters . it really has helped my students to remember not only the names of the planets , but also detailed facts about them . i have recommended this dvd to our school district , for i feel that it should be part of the regular curriculum . the dvd is so wonderful that it can be enjoyed outside the classroom as well and give children a real head-start on learning the planets and developing a passion for astronomy .
