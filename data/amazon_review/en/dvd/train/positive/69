long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light . i rate this movie 5 stars , or 9,5/10 . the movie is included among the 1000 best movies on dvd by peter travers . this new line platinum series edition is really beautiful , with a dvd case simulating the notebook that john doe uses in the movie , and with a second disc full of supplemental material . i miss the typical but in my opinion mandatory `` how it was made '' or `` behind the scenes '' documentary . you see deleted scenes and extended takes , alternate endings with awesome animated storyboards , etc . the movie in disc one comes with an audio track specially recorded for the dvd edition , and in my home theatre sounds terrific . also we have 4 different audio commentaries , by director fincher , freeman , pitt and other collaborators on the film . this is a terrific thriller focused on two detectives ( one new -pitt- another about to retire -freeman- ) after a serial killer ( always brilliant spacey ) who is obsessed with books about the seven capital sins , and kills people who represents them . after the 5th murder , he turns himself in and the last two ( envy and wrath ) are just a masterpiece of an invention . i 've probably seen this movie just 3 or 4 times , but i ca n't help to be absolutely mesmerized and surprised by the genious of the story . this is a masterpiece of a movie . i rarely give 10/10 points to movies , so i gave this 9.5/10 . to be picky , i 'd like a `` hit '' song with the closing credits . but that is just me being picky . the music by howard shore is good . the photography is excellent , the script is in my opinion the very best , and morgan freeman and brad pitt are fabulous . the movie was nominated for best film editing for the academy awards but won nothing . a must for any thriller fan and highly recommended to any movie fan . your collection is not complete without this one . and for the price ( $ 13.99 while i am writing this ) you ca n't get any wrong
