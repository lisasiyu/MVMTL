powerful performances what stands out most in mike nichols ' production of angels in america in the performaces . al pacino takes the cake in this respect in his usual fiery intelligent way . no one else really talked about belize played by jeffrey wright whose going between three principal characters requires a great deal of role changes as well as skill ( not to mention his amusing depiction of mr . lies ) . watch his description of heaven to al pacino 's character very carefully , the calculated intelligence mixed with loathing spite . i think justin kirk goes a little too over the top at times but his scenes with meryl streep are great to watch . the production only falls short with mary louise parker 's character . she reads her lines indifferently and is altogether annoying . i wanted a little more passion and bite from her . another disappointment is the sort of forced ending . each character is forced to talk directly to the camera and it gets a bit too preachy and self concious of a movie/play . but the fully realized characters are what you should come to see
