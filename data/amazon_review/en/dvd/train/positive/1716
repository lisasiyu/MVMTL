best batman made yet this is by far the best batman movie . i give batman returns and batman begins a lot of credit , but you ca n't beat the cast assembled for this movie . the combination of michael keaton and jack nicholson is incredibe , and kim basinger , billy dee williams , and jack palance make a good supporting cast . the story is excellent , with plenty of action . tim burton could not have directed this movie any better , creating a dark and eerie feeling throughout the entire movie . overall , this movie is superb in every category .
