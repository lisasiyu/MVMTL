wears well i first saw this movie on release as a teenager , and thought it was a great scary movie . the main reason i bought it now was to get a hold of the great jerry mulligan soundtrack . the whole family have enjoyed the film now , and leaving out the 70 's gear and hairstyles , its a great thriller
