evil has many faces ! after the death of his mother , elijah wood is left with his uncle 's family while dad david morse takes off for two weeks to settle their future . uncle has two children : a little girl and an older boy wood 's age : macaulay culkin . behind culkin 's angelic visage , naturally , lurks the soul of a devil . wood suspects the evil , but no one will believe him , and so he is left alone to try to stop the increasingly deadly games his cousin is playing . director joseph p. ruben made something of a career of telling tales of domestic horror , what with this , the stepfather and sleeping with the enemy . he claims , in the featurette , to want to reverse our expectations about culkin 's character , which is , of course , nonsense : we know going in that he 's bad . and familiar as evil child territory is ( think the bad seed , the other , the omen , etc. , etc. , etc . ) , this is still an effective example of the genre , benefiting from an admirably economical narrative . the menu is basic , as are the extras : the theatrical trailer , and the usual featurette . nuthin ' special . very much a catalogue-filler release , with no real value-added on this disc . sound and picture are acceptable , and the movie is a decent 86 minutes
