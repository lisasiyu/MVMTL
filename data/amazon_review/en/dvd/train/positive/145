it is like they dropped the slides of the movie and mixed it up this movie is really fun because they mixed everything all around and made it confusing . pay attention the other person is right . this movie is for people who like art movies . it is violent . some people can not follow it , but those who do love it . i really loved it . it is black and white so hopefully that does not turn you off , but it is really great . this is one you have to think with and pay attention to . this is not something to walk in and out of . it would not make any sense at all . not one for kids . they will be really confused . it will take so long to explain it to them and still you may not be able to . a smart teen could probably understand it , but some adults can not . if you are reading reviews i am sure you can . it is some great mental exercise and so much better than other movies when you want something of more substance
