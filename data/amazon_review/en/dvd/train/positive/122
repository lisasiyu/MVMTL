it 's just a title reading these reviews , i was surprised by a number of the comments but most of all by those that rented/bought this movie believing it was somehow about `` angels '' and then had the nerve to complain that they did n't know what it was about or that there were no angels in the movie . with that in mind , i 'd like to offer some advice to those that may inadvertently rent/buy other movies : there are no cuckoo birds and no nests in one flew over the cuckoo 's nest . there is no obvious wind in gone with the wind and what there was did n't blow anything away there are few , if any , good fellas in goodfellas there are no lambs in silence of the lambs chinatown is n't set in a town in china there is neither $ 1,000,000 nor a baby in million dollar baby you guessed it , no bulls in raging bull the coats are made of denim or some such material in full metal jacket paul newman 's body temperature is about 98.6 degrees just like the rest of us in cool hand luke there is little , if any , sleeping in the big sleep the prison hallway is only a few feet long in the green mile the african queen is not about a gay black man no waterfowl were hurt in the making of duck soup the earth rotated as usual on the day the earth stood still there are actually multiple conversations in the conversation the raunchy men 's magazine does not appear in the hustler nobody inherited the wind in inherit the wind . it still belongs to all of us there is no discernible odor while watching the sweet smell of success all the president 's men is only about *some* of the president 's men i hope that some will find these simple reminders useful . if not , you may want to consider looking at the back of a dvd case , visiting your local library or going to one of the thousands of web sites that talk about every movie ever made . as for this film , if you 're not frightened by things that might be different than what you 've experienced or that perhaps strike too close to home , and do n't spend your time judging how everyone else lives , then there is much to love about this work . it may not be perfect , and there can be many legitimate gripes about it , but overall it 's very , very good . scan through the positive reviews here and you 'll get a good sense of it . no need for me to repeat it all here . unfortunately , most ( but not all ) of the negative reviews are just those with some sort of political/religious agenda to put forth instead of commenting on the film
