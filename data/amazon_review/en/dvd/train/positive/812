unique i found the movie to be very creative and unique . i thought the appearance of the movie was very similar to how a stage set-up for a play would be . i thought that this was intentional and it helped to place the focus on the words/message . there was a lot of different things going on in the movie which i enjoyed : greed ; true love ; spirituality ; determination ; self-esteem issues ; and jealousy . i am not a prince fan , but i love the contrast in personalities between prince and morris day , and how this contrast plays out as they pursue the same woman , who happens to be an angel who was sent to change both of them ( clever ) . i gave the movie a 4 and not a 5 because although it was very artistic , morris day lost a battle i feel he should have won
