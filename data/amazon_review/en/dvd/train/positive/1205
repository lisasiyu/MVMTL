kane lives ! ! ! what a surprise , this new version of c & c tiberian wars , is fantastic . the story is great , i 've seen some complain about the story in thier reviews , but perhaps they should re-watch the `` action scenes '' ( a new option in this version ) when i did this i caught things i missed before , making alot more sense afterwards . the graphics are great at full levels , but if you have an older computer there is an option screen to adjust to any option you need to make it playable or experience the best graphics , this also includes audio etc . the `` cast '' of the live action characters , are great , well known and big new stars ! ( billy-dee williams/michael ironside/etc etc ) i recommend , this game for all veteran tiberium fans , and any new fans that like rts games , buy this -- c & c started it all . i wasnt sure if the game would be as good as the past c & c tiberian games , with ea in control now , but they really did pull it off with flying colors . i have yet to play multiplayer -- and have heard that a small number of people are having problems with multiplayer -- but i have heard that the multiplayer problems will be fixed soon , so i 'm keeping busy playing both campaigns ( gdi and nod ) and hopefully the patches will be out by the time i finish
