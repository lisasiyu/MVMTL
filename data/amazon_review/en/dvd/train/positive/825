profound and sad i thought the movie was exceptional . it speaks of human tragedy- the tragedy that occurs on a daily basis- the sadness of everyday life and the small victories that we experience- however small . it speaks of regret- yet as is spoken , you ca n't change what has already happened -- -- nor , can you take it back . i thought it was honest and the performance that ryan gosling gives is true and sad . i give this movie 5 stars because of the profoundness and the sadness of this movie . all of the characters are flawed and expertly portrayed and most definately worth the time ... ..enjoy
