great film performed by a great cast . this first scene of this film caught my attention immediately , it was sort of telling me `` sit tight and pay attention jenny . '' `` sólo mía ' is another film about gender violence in the family . it adopts a totally different attitude to the subject matter when compared with icíar bollaín 's film which is at once more subtle in its telling . `sólo mía ' shoves the nitty-gritty between your teeth so that you can choke on it : some of the scenes are too explicit , one might argue , and are numerously frequent ; in `te doy mis ojos ' the hard subject matter is more carefully handled . however , paz vega , who starred in `lucía y el sexo ' ( qv ) the same year , put in a recommendable performance as the badly beaten and tortured young mother ; sergi lópez as her husband plays his part well , though at times seemed to over forcefully portray his performance , thus almost beggaring belief . it should be said that his role was very tricky , to say the least . i feel that luis tosar carried off his performance in `te doy mis ojos ' more convincingly , with better balancing between the extremes of tensions and feelings . the rest of the cast form a good back-up to the leading couple . this film also points an accusing finger at the legal system , in which hypocritical legalities and aloofness does little - or nothing - to help solve this horrifying situation so evident today in so many headlines in spain today . something has got to be done : more than 70 women were killed in `gender violence ' in spain in 2003 . at the end it 's a great film , i truly admire european cinema that does n't sugar coat their films . highly recommended .
