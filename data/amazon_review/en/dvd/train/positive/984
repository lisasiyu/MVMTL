totally underrated ! ! this is a fabulous & quot ; feel good & quot ; movie . i 've watched it a dozen times and it 's still a favorite to pop in the vcr when company comes calling . this movie never got the publicity it deserved so it 's pretty much a surprise when i play it for guests . then , everyone wants a copy . i probably would never have heard of it myself if my mom had n't been an extra in it . it was filmed in winchester bay , oregon where my mom had a gift shop
