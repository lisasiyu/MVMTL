very clever , a lot of fun ! considering i just saw cars , i was n't so sure about over the hedge . i mean , cars actually became one of my favorites after i finished it ! but i gave this a shot and i 'm glad i did . i 'll admit , the whole concept of r.j. using the others to repay a debt was n't very original , but the way it was executed made it very enjoyable . now i 'm debating whether or not i want to buy it . i 'd say rent it first , but if you have kids , this is a good one for your collection
