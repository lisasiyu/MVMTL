i could watch vitti read the phone book ( and i 'm surprised she never gets around to that in this beautiful neo-realist classic ) this is the first movie i 've netflixed twice . i kept it for two months the first time , watched almost all of it , but then lost patience and sent it back because there was something else i wanted to get quickly . but i could n't stop thinking back about it and wound up renting it again . i 'm considering just going ahead and buying it . i still have n't figured out if i actually *like* it or not . but i ca n't stop watching it . how can a movie this cold and distant and remote be so affecting ? how can a film so full of detail and business be so cold and distant and remote ? monica vitti plays a stylishly unhappy woman who basically wanders around rome , falling out of one relationship into another , with alain delon . she 's so wan that i often wanted to step in and shove her , but at the same time , she has an absolutely captivating presence . eventually , i actually stopped caring anything about the plot and just relished the endless scenes in which i could take in her long , slender nose and her slim , sleepy eyes . is that a intelligent reason for liking this film ? probably not but fortunately i do n't really care .
