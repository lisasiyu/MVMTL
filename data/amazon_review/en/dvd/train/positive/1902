finally , i 'm starting to win this dvd is terrific . rather than describe the content , as most have , i 'll discuss the results . i 'm a rookie that plays with friends every couple of weeks . i 've been playing for less than a year . i had n't been a very winning player for a while , but went to vegas recently . i watched this dvd and studied the pre-flop strategy , odds chart and hold'em race odds charts , and decided to take a chance and enter a low-dollar tournament . what a blast- i finished 11th out of 51 players . the next night , i entered another tournament . i made it to the final table and placed in the money- 7th . wow , i thought i was going to be taken to the cleaners , but did pretty well against some clearly more experienced veterans . after returning from the trip , i immediately beat my friends , two games in a row . i had been getting my butt kicked by them for a couple of months now , so needless to say , this video has really turned my game around . i did n't realize how much i misunderstood about the game until i watched this video . i 'm doing things in reverse order- now i 'm going to purchase the first dvd to make sure i get the basics down , to add to these advanced techniques
