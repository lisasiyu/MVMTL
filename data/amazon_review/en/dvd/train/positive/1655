robert altman , fresh off his hit 'mash ' made this great film . terrific use of lighting and camera work . if you like hbo 's 'deadwood ' series you 'll see where they got there story line here . leonard cohen 's songs fit perfectly with the story . cohen , so it goes was very taken with altman 's work on 'mash ' and after 'mccabe ' was finished gave the song 's to altman to use . that 's right gave . he did n't take any money for hits like 'sisters of mercy ' and the 'stranger song '
