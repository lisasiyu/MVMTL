definitely an interesting film i feel very fortunate to have been able to grab a promo copy of this film . it is a rather dark look into the life of someone who could be your normal 'shy guy ' . however , this one 's got a secret that he 's now got to punish himself for . the movie moves a little slowly , but definitely gives itself time to build up the characters ( not hard , considering it 's focused on 'roman ' ( lucky mcgee ) , who gets almost all the screen time ) . by the end of the film , i was really starting to feel for the character and hoping to see things go his way , despite his issues . i have watched this movie a few times now , and will be continuing to do so quite a few more ... and am looking forward to the regular dvd release so i can check out the bonus features . i would recommend this film to anyone who loves horror , as well as general fans of lucky mcgee or angela bettis . glad to see another good one come out
