can i give it 6 stars ? an outstanding animated comedy , hoodwinked , brings to the screen a `` different '' take on the well-known little red riding hood story . in addition to the `` traditional '' company of adorable characters from the classic fairy tale , the cherry on the cake has to be the hilarious and hyperactive squirrel . anne hathaway , james belushi , glenn close , and the rest of the cast , have truly outdone themselves with their performances , which are exceptional to say the least ! all the actors , without exceptions , give it their 100 % and it really shows ( the animation does come alive ) ! very well written and very well presented , the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs . the film is simple enough , but does a great job of providing high quality entertainment the likes of which we do n't get to see often enough . the setting , the plot , the dialogues , the humor ( ! ! ! ) and the music are all wonderful ! in short , hoodwinked is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection ! strongly recommended along with shrek and shrek 2 .
