superb interpretation by mia farrow as a mad fan of woody allen , i have to recognize that his ex gives a show of interpretation in this film . she is simply delightful ! i gave `` only '' four stars because if other films by woody deserve only 5 stars , then a give 4 for this but 5 for my other review `` the front ''
