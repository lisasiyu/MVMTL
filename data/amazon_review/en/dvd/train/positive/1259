damn yank this could have been a 5 star movie because it is hard for me to follow the dialect without subtitles though the acting by the cast was what made up for this . the cinematography is great and was sentimental seeing the coast of cornwall . i saw this movie primarily cause of imogen stubbs playing the part of a tomboy as being plausable because of a boyish figure like hilary swank , who is a hotty too . i found imogen attractive in other roles and was curious as to how i would see her . well it was amusing to watch the scenes where her cover could have been revealed whether or not she was fooling anyone i could not care cause she still looked fine as a woman to me . one particular time was when an instructor was correcting her posture during fencing training at the military academy . later i enjoyed her swordsmanship in a duel that was surprisingly aggressive so that you would not mind having her around alot enjoying life . there is a relationship between twins that is very poinyant during the beginning and at the end of the film that imogen had part into that is worth noting
