great comedy from an impractical lifestyle i first saw `` good neighbors '' ( 1975-77 ) in the late 1970s on pbs , shortly after the show was completed . i was impressed with the wit and comic timing of the actors , and the subtle comedy which did n't hit you over the head to make a point . when they came on the market in vhs format , i decided to buy them in installments , and am very happy i did . you likely know the story : richard briers plays tom good , a frustrated 40 year old draftsman who works for a plastics company . good and his wife barabara ( felicity kendall ) decide to `` get back to basics '' and thereby tom quits his job , turns the yard into a huge garden , buys chickens and pigs for livestock and decides to become self sufficient , bartering for only what they need , etc . not a practical life style for 1970s suburban london . contrasting are their neighbors : jerry and margo ledbetter , played by paul eddington and penelope keith . mr. ledbetter is an executive in the plastics company tom good used to work for ; he crawls and grovels to the boss to keep his high paying job , which supports his expensive and well furnished home . ledbetter is a slave to his work despite finanicial prosperity ; good does n't answer to a boss or schedule , but faces obstacle after obstacle with his crops or livestock . the chemistry and comic timing between all 4 principal actors is very fine , and the laughs are many and frequent . despite the impractical plot - no one would get away with having livestock in a subdivision anywhere in the civilized world for long - this makes for wholesome entertainment . i have n't seen the dvd version for comparison , but the vhs tapes are very good quality : clear picture , great camera work .
