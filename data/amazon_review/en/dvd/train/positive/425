i am reviewing the shows not the format ! this is a wonderful collection ! it is misleading and disappointing to see the rating for this set so low -- especially when many ratings were based on `` wide screen '' as opposed to `` full . '' the format does n't change the story or the fun viewers have watching . `` gidget goes to rome '' , however , is my least favorite . james darren had chemistry with sandra dee and deborah walley ; it was lacking with cindy carol . enjoy the innocence of an era gone and relish the fact that we are fortunate these movies are still around -- - in wide or full screen
