good compilation of live show , with promo footage to boot the anthology is a very good collection of 3 live shows from bruce dickinson 's , pulled from many sources . dvd one has tattoo millionaire tour live footage ( dive dive dive ) , and skunkworks live . the dive video is poor quality shots , and the sound is not the greatest . my favorite is the skunkworks footage . that album was probably the best of his first three solo albums in terms of musicianship and variation from maiden . it 's good to the footage done when it was still fresh , and laugh at bruce trying to be `` alternative '' . disc two is just scream for me brazil in yet another package . good song set , playing bruce 's best solo work ever ( chemical wedding material ) , but it 's too bad that the sound is poor and video is cut from video feeds from the crowd screens . pretty disapointing disc , could have been left out , made the package cost less , and no one would have missed it . this keeps this dvd from getting 5 stars disc three is the cool best part of this package . the promo videos are just nice to have in one spot . the tyranny of souls promo video is interesting , and where else are you going to find the samson footage . all of the videos also have an intro option with bruce dickinson describing the story of each video ( like knowing the `` tatooed millionaire '' video was directed by the pink floyd `` learning to fly '' directory ... now the connection is made ) . nice job with the last disc . overall , i feel the skunkworks video and the promo material are the best parts of this collection , and make it worth the 10 dollars i paid for this . i would suggest to all to try an pay under 20 dollars for this collection , because the bulk of these dvd 's is filler on disc two , and i would feel ripped off by it . if you have been a long time maiden/dickinson fan , get this anyway .
