uncut funk if you are looking for and need special features and clips that are as slick as any music video being produced in 2007 , then i 'm sorry to say you will be disappointed with the mothership connection live from houston . for everyone else , what the dvd chronicles is p funk the way it sounded and was performed each night in the mid-1970s ; you just never knew who may show up to make the concert just a bit more funkier . by the end of the show , the opening act - sly and the family stone - along with bootsy collins and members of his rubber band are in on the funkified jam . recorded in 1976 , it was at a time when concerts were n't being chronicled on a nightly basis for possible future use . i would wager that a member of the stage crew decided to capture the gig on tape and it was gathering dust in a vault somewhere before the audio was enhanced about as well as it could have been for release . what makes this a special gem is the `` rough '' nature of the video . the band and guest performers were not on stage knowingly making a movie ; this is a tour date with all the power , energy & surprises that george clinton delivered each night to the audience . that in itself makes the dvd an important part of any music collection .
