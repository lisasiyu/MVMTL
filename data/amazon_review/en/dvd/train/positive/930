great for what it is this is a movie that stands on it 's own without being a remake . like the 'dawn of the dead ' movie in early 2000 , this is kind of like a retelling of sorts ; the key plotline generally remains the same , but there are some nice changes and unexpected turns as well . i thought the acting overall was really good ; ermey was def . the best surprise here , and the movie had a very sleek look to it that actually complimented it 's content . the same cinematographer from the original returns for the remake , and there are some very nice nods to the original ; the part w/leatherface chasing one victim through the clotheslines hung with lots of white sheets was a memorable moment for me..but make no mistake : this movie is brutal in it 's violence , and there is alot of it . and while not really 'scary ' ( except for sheriff hoyt ... yikes ! ! ! ) , this is one intense , horrific ride . the comment on the box read `` if you want horror ... this is horror ! ! '' . for once the box speaks the truth . plus jessica biel spends the whole movie is a semi-revealing tank top , so that never hurts as far as i 'm concerned..
