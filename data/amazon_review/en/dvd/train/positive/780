a rewarding investment ( of time ) , but not a cop show the wire is easily one of the greatest , if not the greatest , cinematic pieces of art ever . potential watchers know this however , this is a show that requires a significant amount of commitment ; do not expect to sit back and be entertained . the show challenges the watcher and requires reflection on an array of intellectual levels . at a minimum , the reasonably bright should have no problem connecting the scattered dots the wire 's creators masterfully placed for viewers . the dull on the other hand will only see a show with cops and a group of unintelligible thugs while searching for the quick entertainment fix that can only come from brainless shows like cops , csi , or the shield .
