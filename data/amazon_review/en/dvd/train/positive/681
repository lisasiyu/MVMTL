coen brothers do it again it never ceases to amaze me how the coen brothers make me love movies from genres that i do n't usually like . take this film for instance , its been out for six years , when it came out i said it looks dumb , i do n't like stories about hillbillies , but thats not what it is at all , its actually a great film with all kinds of twists and turns . in a word it can be described as delightful , with the most fun part of o'brother being that it keeps you guessing throughout , just when you think one thing is going to happen , bam , supprise , something else . i really enjoyed the music too , i ca n't get that damn soggy bottom boys song outta my head , and i doubt you 'll be able to either . my only regret is that i was to ignorant to watch it sooner , i hope you really enjoy this film as much as i did .
