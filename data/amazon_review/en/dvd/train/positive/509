not bad at all for an indie thriller as i never expect a lot from indie thrillers , this one was far better than i thought . although the twists and turns were not quite unpredictable , they still got you some way or another . also , enjoy a good performance ( and some real nice body shots ) given by nastassja kinsky if you 're a fan of hers . to me nastassja looked much better with age and she really mastered the sex scenes when needed . josh holloway ( playing the psycho depressed hunk ) was fine too . i would give this movie 5 stars if they cast someone more convincing ( like william h. macy ) in the place of jeff fahey . but , as i said , i never expect a lot ...
