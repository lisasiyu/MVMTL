an eye-opener different people are struck by different things in movies , and what struck me about this one is that it is about community . people always form themselves into little villages , even if only one block square in a big city . there 's always a vague , loose hierarchy , with what you could call the village elders at the top -- in the case of this movie , cedric the entertainer . then you 've got the laziest and most dishonest at the bottom -- that would be the guy who cheats on his girlfriend and sticks another woman under his bed when she shows up unexpectedly . the barbershop itself is the community gathering place . that 's really what this movie is about -- community , neighborhood , and how people interact in it
