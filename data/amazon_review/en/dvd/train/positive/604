`` it 's the world against us and us against the world ! '' oh so dashing errol flynn is peter blood , a doctor thrown into slavery without just cause . fiercely loyal to his fellow slaves and the fight for justice he leads his men to freedom and life on the high seas as pirates ! arrrrrrrgh ! highly entertaining from beginning to end , normally when a film gets boring i bust off a few rattlers to liven things up but there was no need for that here ! this film did n't let up for a minute . even the talking parts were exciting thanks to the story and the chemistry between flynn and olivia de havilland , who by the way is smoking hot in this movie . another reason to get this dvd or even better yet the flynn box set is the great extras including a informative 22-minute featurette called `` captain blood : a swashbuckler is born '' . did you know co-star ross alexander committed suicide at the age of 29 using the same rifle that his wife had committed suicide with ? ! yikes . also check out the score by erich korngold
