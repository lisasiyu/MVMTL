one of the best movies ever , and easily the best in the series i 'm a huge fan of 2 , 4 , and 5 but this movie just gives me everything i want -- -- -- great acting , great fights , good sets , great stunts , and the best score ever . my only 2 problems with this movie are the americans being portrayed incorrectly and no yuen biao showing his true skills . i mean yuen biou is no jet but he is better than 99 % of movie martial artists . but , jet is in full form and only in fist of legend wil you see anything close to that you are seeing this . also the baddie ( who is not a bad guy , just more fo an opponent for jet ) in this movie has n't looked this good since shadow ninja . i have seen this edition and it is the full 134 min . with a decent ric myers commentary
