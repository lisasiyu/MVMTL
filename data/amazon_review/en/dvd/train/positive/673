very impressive dvd i had always wanted to try pilates , but was intimidated by the thought of actually trying some of the exercises that i 've seen people doing . i hurt my left knee 3 years ago and have a hard time walking and sitting for any length of time . well , i had a hard time . i have been using this dvd for 2 months now , and can do all the beginner 's exercises , even the ones i thought i could n't do . i was pleasantly surprised at the enjoyment and sense of well-being that i get from the program . the instructor is laid back , pleasant , and offers helpful hints . you can actually see what she is doing at all times , and she explains things very well
