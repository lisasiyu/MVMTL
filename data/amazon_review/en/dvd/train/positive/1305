wild west ... say hello to film noir ! as other reviewers have already mentioned , this underated classic is a brilliant combination of film noir & the wild west . the photography is simply amazing . the flashbacks , dreamlike sequences , & one particularly memorable scene in which mitchum 's stepbrother is seen in the background slowly stalking mitchum while planning to shoot him are what make this an incredible western . robert mitchum plays jeb rand , the lone rand family survivor after a bloody feud . rescued & raised by ma callum ( judith anderson ) he grows up with her two kids : thor ( teresa wright ) & adam ( john rodney ) . jeb gets along with thor just great , so great that they fall in love ! this does n't sit well with adam who never accepts jeb as a part of the family . their rivalry only worsens as they grow older , eventually leading to tragic results which tear the family apart . mitchum commands the screen so well with his amazing performance that he makes acting look easy . this is easily his best western & one of his greatest roles of his career . the chemestry between him & teresa wright is one of the best things about this classic . add max steiner 's music & you 've got one awesome film ! and let 's not forget the underated alan hale , who has a small but memorable supporting role as a friend of jeb 's . considered as the first psychological western , this is an unforgettable gem that you need to add to your dvd collection
