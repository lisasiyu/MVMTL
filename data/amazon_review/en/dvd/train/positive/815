a slow spin in the porcelain i 'll make this short and sweet . i used to work in spin . i did advance , which is creating media events for politicians . in other words , for a time i was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information . i 'll let others speak to the eerie connections to orwell 's foresight . i 'll let others write about how effectively the film makers make the case . that which is represented in this piece is true . the observations are astute . the prognosis is grim . i wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who clings to the belief in the ideas of the founding fathers . buy it . watch it . watch it again . share it with friends .
