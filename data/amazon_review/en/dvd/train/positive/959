pretty good fantasey ! to tell you the truth i had never read the book before because the libary always has other holds on it but i went ahead and wacthed this movie with my sister and younger brother we were hoping we would enjoy it despit bad reveiws , so it turns out we liked it , my sister said it 's seem 's more of a remake of lord of the rings ( as everyone else does ) the dragon was wonerfully done we liked the fact that it had a mind of it 's own . ed spellers did better than i thought for a newcomer , i always enjoy jeremy irons ( exepct for the really bad d & d ) the only miscast really was john malvoich as the evil king i just think he did n't fit well , overall a pretty good fantasy not a classic but good enough for me . ( it 's my 3rd favariet dragon movie besides dragonheart and dragonslayer i highly recommend those )
