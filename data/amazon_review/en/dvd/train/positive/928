outstanding film for then and now . but about that title ... ? ? ? as with the other reviewers of this film , i must agree that in its restored and complete form , this is an outstanding film . the supplemental material is also quite interesting . the themes in this film are just as relevant today as they were when it was made . most anything else i could write would be redundant with what others have written . i will admit that at points i felt the film dragged a bit , having made a point but not moving on . maybe i am just too much a product of watching too many fast paced films of today . one thing i find curious about this movie is the title . since the main character is not colonel blimp and is really a much deeper character than the cartoon character , i wonder why the film was given the name it was . i wonder how many people went to see this movie expecting a comedy based on a cartoon character . my minor quibbles aside , this is really an excellent film and worth seeing .
