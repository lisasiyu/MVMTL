a horror film that stands the test of time ! simply put , most horror films do n't age well at all . when i use the term `` horror '' i 'm not refering to the endless supply of slasher and gross-out flicks that have co-opted the genre , i 'm speaking of suspensful tales of the unknown . this is the category in which `` the changeling '' resides and i 'm happy to say that it 's one of the few movies of its type that stands the test of time . the changeling does n't rely on special effects or movie monsters to tell its story . a strong script , excellent direction and fine performances have kept this film looking vibrant and feeling valid 25+ years after its initial release . i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspensful thrillers ( hitchcock ) or modern horror films in the mold of `` the sixth sense '' . if you 're looking for blood and guts or lots of violence you 'll need to look elsewhere ( thankfully ) . this film always chooses the high road to deliver its thrills . for those who do n't prefer to watch r-rated films i can assure you that this film contains almost no foul langauge , has very little violence , no nudity , and certainly nothing that can be considered `` graphic '' by todays standards . most modern films rated pg-13 have more disturbing content than this film . if you 're an adult viewer looking for suspense and thrills but you want to avoid gore and graphic violence ... . the changeling is a good choice ! not a perfect film , but an excellent effort that holds up well . -j
