a classic it 's a beautiful classic made during our time . if you love romance , this is a beatiful remake of a classic . love the children 's and annette 's rendition of the beatles `` i will '' . dissapointed that the song is not on the original soundtrack . i bought the vhs version in 96 and lent it to my friends . they all loved it . they kept wanting to borrow and replay it - for the song ; as well as for the beautiful everything that best describes the the movie . the vhs is now kaput and i definitely have this in my list of the next one to add to my collection of dvds . hope you will enjoy it too
