great cartoons , but some are not well restored we bought this installment of the `` disney treasures '' series when it was released late in 2005 . my 9 year old son and i just watched these cartoons again ( oct. 2006 ) and we both love them . i would have to agree , however , with those reviewers who have noted that visually the cartoons in this vol . 2 of the `` chronological donald '' were not restored to the same degree of perfection as those in earlier releases , including vol . 1 of the `` chronological donald '' and the release containing many donald world war ii cartoons entitled `` on the front lines '' . there is a clear difference in quality , which is apparent when the donald cartoons previously released in `` on the front lines '' and repeated in this collection are compared to the cartoons that are new here . the former are visually superior , not because they were better to begin with , but because they have been more carefully restored and transferred . this is a shame . one hopes that in chronological donald vol 3 ( apparently not to be released in 2006 , but perhaps in 2007 ) there will be a return to the quality of vol . 1 and `` on the front lines . '' one might even hope for a new , improved vol . 2 , but that is probably not in the cards
