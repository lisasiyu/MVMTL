one sweet comedy ! the title says it all : sugar & spice . it 's a sweet yet sour comedy about the a-squad cheerleaders and their sister-like friendship as they all unite to help the head cheerleader , diane ( played by adorable marley shelton ) and her quarterback boyfriend support the twins they 're expecting . i watched this movie not knowing anything about it , and i honestly thought as soon as diane learns she 's pregnant and gives her boyfriend the news , that he was going to leave her , but he could n't have been more happy . in fact , the only people upset with the news are their parents who disown them , leaving the young couple to fend for themselves . they marry and take minimum wage jobs to pay for their apartment and the expected twins , but it 's not enough . but that does n't stop the a-squad from coming up with a heist plan sure to give the couple the cash they need to care for their babies . told from the point of view of a bitter b-squad cheerleader , this is one of those fun movies like mean girls that 's funny yet sweet without being too sugary . it will leave you cheering for these good bad girls the entire way . enjoy ... this one is definitely a keeper
