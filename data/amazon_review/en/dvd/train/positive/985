the weakest season ? i think not ! season 7 has this stigma attached to it that it is the weakest season out of all the seasons of friends . i have no idea what these people are talking about . yes , some episodes were better than others and some plotlines were tedious , but i still thought this was a great season . the main theme of this season is the planning of monica and chandler 's wedding , but there are many storylines scattered throughout , such as rachel 's romance with her assistant , joey returning to days of our lives , the brief return of phoebe 's scientist boyfriend , and ross learning to play bagpipes . this season will have you in stitches ! here 's a list of my favorite episodes from this season : the one with phoebe 's cookies the one with rachel 's assistant the one with the nap partners the one where chandler does n't like dogs the one with all the candy the one with the holiday armadillo the one where rosita dies the one where they all turn thirty the one with joey 's new brain the one with the cheap wedding dress the one with ross and monica 's cousin the one with the vows the one with monica and chandler 's wedding next is the season where rachel is pregnant ! ca n't wait !
