very well done i really enjoyed this concert dvd . the sound is excellent . the performance is mesmerizing ; it was one hell of a show . occasionally , i was a little distracted by the post production editing which detracted from the show . that is my one complaint . i 'm not familiar with all the artists that assisted with the show , but i am assuming it was a huge a-list of hip hop stars . i would definitely see the gorillaz in concert after watching this dvd
