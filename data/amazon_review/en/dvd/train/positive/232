loved the 90 's workout after doing kathy smiths old style prenatal video and leisa hart 's fitmama video , i had to try one of leisa hart 's oldie videos and was so happy to find she had one on dvd ... it was a blast seeing the thong outfits from the buns of steel videos , i really ca n't wait to do more after my pregnancy , but this is a balst to modify some of the routines , this was a really old style dvd
