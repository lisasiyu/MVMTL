friday night lights where i come from high school sports in general was something merely for the jocks to participate in and rarely garnered any widespread interest within the school . football games -- except for the annual `` bowl '' game against our cross-town rival ( eventually discontinued because of the traditional post-game brawl ) -- rarely found more than one hundred parents and students attending . so some of the meaning behind this film is i guess lost , leaving me more of a dispassionate observer than anything else . still , i really found this movie to be quite fascinating , and a powerful and well-told story .
