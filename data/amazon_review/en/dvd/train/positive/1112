another equal sequel very few sequels live up to their famous firsts , even though spiderman 2 and shrek 2 recently shattered this premise . this is another in that rare grouping , running at an entertaining 12 minutes longer than the first . this time we learn of the existence of a whole network of spy kids , and carmen and juni have to prove their mettle against a well heeled sister and brother duo from hell . their adventures take them to a mysterious island , invisible to radar , where `` the island of dr. moreau '' meets `` sinbad '' , `` jurassic park '' and `` fantasy island '' . star turns by ricardo montalban as carmen and juni 's grandfather , and steve buscemi as the nutty scientist , as well as cameos by alan cumming and tony shaloub increase the entertainment value fourfold . the rival spy kids dialogue and superciliousness go against the grain sometimes , but the gadgetry is as brilliant as the first , even though they do n't always work when needed . imagination rules here , and if you like those old adventure movies with fantastic creatures and swashbuckling heroes , you will like this one . better yet , adults can enjoy it without needing the excuse of having a child . amanda richards , may 5 , 2005
