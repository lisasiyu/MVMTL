just one question : what did you people expect ? come on people ! what did you expect from this movie ? did you think it was going to be like the slience of the lambs ? did you think it was going to win best picture ? did you think that micheael douglas or his hot wife or their daughter would die ? i seriously hope not . everyone knew what was going to happen in this movie . there would be action , suspense and a very predictable ending . no , duh . did you really think that the ending would be shocking ? did you think that the bad guys would kill anyone ? come on . i did n't expect anything of this movie . nothing . and if you were like me , then you would have like it . but , on the other hand , if you were expecting a thriller like seven or the silence of the lambs , then yeah , you 'd be disspointed . but , i decided to rent this , wanting to watch a fun and interesting movie . and it was . i enjoyed the plot , enjoyed the action , enjoyed the suspense , and enjoyed the acting by michael douglas and brittany murphy . i always am up for watching excellent movies like ghost world , frailty , american history x , seven , etc.. but movies like that are hard to come around . in comes movies like do n't say a word . they 're predictable , even lame , but i still find them to be fun and amusing . maybe if you people would lower your dam* expectations , maybe you 'd enjoy movies like this . this is worth a rent if you do n't expect seeing a best picture nominee . but , all the reviewers on amazon obviously were thinking : `` the next silence of the lambs ! the next seven ! weeh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' yeah , like michael douglas would actually die or anything plot twist , crazy like seven is going to happen in this movie . you 'll like this if you lower your expectations .
