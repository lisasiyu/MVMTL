eastwood 's best very entertaining western/action/drama . clint eastwood 's best role ever . it is very violent and there is some strong language . so do n't be fooled by the pg rating - it 's not for kids . there 's a pretty intense attempted rape scene as well . i detected no real political agenda except maybe a shot at nationalism , which deserves to be shot
