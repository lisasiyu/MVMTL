great workout this workout will get you reslts . i did it for about a month and was completely toned . i wasnt that out of shape to begin with but it certainly worked its magic quickly . i would say its a bit difficult to get through ... what i like is that even after youve done it for a month its still somewhat of a challenge to finish . the areas worked are exactly where women need it , you wont be disapointed . i dont mind her personally either . its a bit much but when your doing a difficult workout it can be a welcome boost
