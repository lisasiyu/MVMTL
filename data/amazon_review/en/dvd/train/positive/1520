excellent anime ! this is one of my favorite anime series of all time . i 've had this collection for about a month and not only have i watched it repeatedly , but i 've shown it to all of my friends and now they all want it ! this thinpack boxset is a great value over buying the series individually . one note : this has all 12 episodes of fumoffu on 3 discs , while the separate dvds have 12 episodes on 4 discs . ( when i saw a fourth disc for sale i got worried that i was missing something . ) i watched all of the fumuffo eopisodes before watching the complete original full metal panic and still thoroughly ejoyed them . there is n't much carry-over between them , although the characters are the same . i love sosuke 's deadpan comic lines . my favorite episode is the `` patient of darkness , '' where kaname tries to get a rise out sosuke in a haunted hospital . a must have for your anime collection
