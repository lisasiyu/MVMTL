much needed and appreciated ... while this might not be for everyone , it is something to behold . i happened upon the 'o ' show , as she spoke about it ( wayback when ) and i was very intrigued . before that episode ended , my order was being placed for the dvd version , here . i purchased the cd version , after watching the movie . it was beyond words ( i found myself tearing and nodding during most of the movie ) and i 'm incorporating the secret in my life as well as my family . i listen to the cd version while getting ready for work in the morning and while doing my work , at night . it has helped me immensely and i 'll continue to do so . i 'm so very glad that i decided to check here for the hardcover book ... hooray , the price has been reduced ... yipeee ! i 'll get that as soon as i 'm done with this review . thanks rhonda byrne and aloha from hawaii
