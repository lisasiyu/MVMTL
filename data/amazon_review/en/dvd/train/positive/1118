six stars if i could ! ! ! the art of knitting was great for a beginner knitter like myself . a few minutes after popping in the dvd i was on my way to knitting my first hat . the knitting library was great for help w/ terms and abbreviations and the jazz selection to knit by was wonderful . this dvd is a great introduction to the world of knitting and has a ton of exciting projects for beginner and advanced knitters alike . if you feel overwhelmed when looking at knit book instructions and illustrations then i would highly reccmmend this dvd because the knitting lessons with jennifer makes you feel like you have your very own personal instructor . there 's so much on this dvd you just have to see it for yourself , i know you 'll love it too ! i can easily see why this is the # 1 knitting dvd on the market . go and buy it
