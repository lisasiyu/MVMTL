an excellent film with a wonderful pace this film is as slow as a day in your own childhood but with plenty to do and see in the nothing of it all . the vivid transparency from which the director coaxes all the many simple details is astonishing . this sort of cinema must be very hard to bring together as almost no one can really pull it off . the japanese director ozu was the master of it.and this is about as close as can get to a modern version of him . it 's really about the events of two brothers in childhood and i ca n't say enough good about it . i have seen it twice and i can only imagine it getting better with successive viewings . the only sort of awkward bit for me was when nature talked back in the guise of woodland hags etc.. but i never thought nature needed a human voice to speak for itself
