nail on the head i watched this film when it was originally released theatrically . i remember that the response from the audience was much the same as the response i remember when i saw robocop ( had to sneak in ) in the theater : a few people clapped enthusiastically and the rest looked around at each other as if to wonder `` is it o.k . to have enjoyed this ? ... . '' i , myself just enjoyed the well assembled action and the perfectly timed humor . a few years later i joined the army and a few years after that ... well you know what happened ... . i have to say that i appreciate the satirical component of the film much more than i did at the time . at this point most people can appreciate that war is hell ( that clich√© ' is for real , 100 % unadulterated , bone fide , certified , and not-likely-to-change-in-the-near-future , fact ) . even if one begins righteously , that is with a proper justification , the physical realities of what happens on the battle field are no less horrific . there are tools on the battle field that are there strictly to turn your average teeny-bopper into softball sized chunks of red stuff ( i mean that literally ) . verhoeven understands this and does an excellent job of contrasting that reality with the type of fantasy rationalization that is required to ( at least successfully ) prosecute large scale violence . for me the most poignant moment in the film is when then main characters confront the bugs for the first time and witness a fellow soldier being ripped to shreds . the female trooper who `` joined to have babies ... '' makes an absolutely blood curdling shriek and then turns to run . the look on the actress 's face and the sound of her voice , completely captures the feeling one gets when one is being fired at in anger . whether one admits it or not . i highly recommend this film . i think it should be required viewing .
