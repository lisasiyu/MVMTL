charming and fun my 3-year-old daughter loves max & ruby . the somewhat patient big sister , ruby , spends her time with friends and bunny scouts , while her little brother , max , spends his time finding ways to cause mischief . based on books by rosemary wells , these short stories are fun , sweet , and gentle viewing for small children . the dvds have an auto-play function , which is handy to the parents or caregiver with the child . the show starts on its own if the menu is left untouched for more than 30 seconds or so . when the episodes are all played out , it goes back to the menu and restarts . while tv/dvds should not be used as alternatives to good parenting , the right ones can be helpful in distracting a child while said parent tries to get things done around the home . i highly recommend `` max & ruby '' of any title . they are all wonderful . [ my husband even gets a kick out of max 's antics . ] -c.w
