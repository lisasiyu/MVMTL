for trower lovers robin trower defined that rich , full overdriven modulated ( hendrix-inspired ) sound of his way back in the early '70 's , and he still lays it on thick . as a guitarist , i ca n't help but to still love that `` sound '' , even after 30 years ! this dvd will serve trower up to you on a platter . hey ... i do n't care if the guy looks like someone 's grand daddy standin ' up there ... . we 're all growing old too , right along with the stars of our youth . it 's great that he can still pull this stuff off and come out sounding as fabulous as he does . ( no arthritis in those hands , i can tell you . ) now , if you do n't love trower , the show will probably get a little old after a few numbers . but if you do love him ( and that `` sound '' ... ) , and particularly if you play , you 'll thoroughly enjoy this dvd
