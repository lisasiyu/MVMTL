incredible , uplifting , and inspiring after watching `` tupac resurrection , '' i found myself with a much greater appreciation for 2pac 's music . i was also amazed how 2pac 's many interviews and recordings were seemlessly pieced together to make it sound as if tupac himself was narrating his own documentary . although it is a bit eerie at first listening to a dead man narrate his own life ( and death ) , it is a much more involving and incredible experience with 2pac 's narration . tupac lived an amazing life , even if it was tragically cut short . tupac resurrection , then , is a movie that can be appreciated even by people who are not fans of tupac or rap in general . i watched this movie with my brother , who is absolutely not a fan of rap at all , and even he enjoyed the movie . it is just that 2pac was such a charismatic , intelligent , and poetic man that he is just fascinating to listen to . and , this movie is doubly fascinating listening to a man narrate his entire life , from birth to death . if you are a fan of 2pac , this is a must-have . as i said before , after watching `` tupac resurrection '' i gained an even greater appreiciation of his music . even for those that are n't fans of tupac or even rap in general , i highly recommend this movie because it is simply an intense story about a man that is birthed into this world with nothing , becomes rich from an intense dedication to his artistic medium , and then dies a tragic , early death . the only thing i have left to do is quote roger ebert 's review , because i really believe he hits the nail right on the head when he says , `` let 's assume you are a person who never intends to see a doc about rap music , but might have it in you to see one . this is the one . '' i highly recommend this movie to everyone . rap fans or not . tupac fans or not
