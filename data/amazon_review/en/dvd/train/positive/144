really good although all over the place at times this film is about a young porn star who of course had tragedy in her life . when she was 12 her mother committed suicide . after her mothers death her father has a break down and later develops parkinson 's disease . at 18 she enters the porn industry and fast forward several years later she seems quite happy with her voyeristic life . she juggles being a porn star with caring for her dad and hanging out with her crew of porn star friends and every day girls like her lifelong friend played by rosario dawson who is a law student and another friend who is a teacher . i really enjoyed this film but could n't help but feel like the actress who portrayed moon was doing her best angelina jolie impersonation , i mean she had angelina down pat . james wood deserves an oscar for his role as the dad who has seen himself go down . i enjoyed this film , but like many other films i was frustrated with the story at times . it seemed to be all over the place sometimes . i never knew if the love story between moon and her blind date was going anywhere , then we see mon venture off into a new business , then the porn stars find themselves in mini-crisis ' . although it was all over the place at times , it was a great little indy film , the best indy film i have seen since `` secretary .
