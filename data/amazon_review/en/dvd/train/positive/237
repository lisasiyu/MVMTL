it 's about time ! ! ! i have been waiting a long time for a decent gallagher dvd to be released , but it has been worth the wait . this compilation contains 11 full length gallagher concerts including : disc 1 `` mad as hell '' `` two real '' `` stuck in the 60 's '' `` the maddest '' disc 2 `` melon crazy '' `` over your head '' `` the bookkeeper '' `` overboard '' disc 3 `` we need a hero '' `` messin ' up texas '' `` an uncensored evening '' these all appear to be unedited and uncut since there original airing . i used to catch these concerts re-aired on comedy central on saturday mornings but have not seen them for about 10 years . i am so happy that they finally released this great collection of gallagher works ... his comedy has already stood the test of time for over 20 years , and with this dvd , gallagher can be introduced to new audiences and remembered by his fans . there are also 2 `` best of gallagher '' dvd 's that have been released , and i am wondering if they are just highlights from the 11 concerts contained on this `` smashing watermelon collection '' or if they have different material on them . hopefully someone will review them soon . if you like gallagher , i am sure you will buy this collection ... but even if you just like comedy , you should get this in order to realize just how smart and funny gallagher really is and you will discover how much influence he has had on many other comedians .
