what do you do with a problem called mary clarence ? what do you do when you witness you boyfriend killing someone ? go into witness protection at a convent . lounge singer deloris becomes sister mary clarence . but when sister mary clarence is whoopi goldberg expect a lot of attitude . delores finds it hard adjusting to convent life . that is until she gets her hands on the choir . she turns a mediocre off key group into a hip ensemble . this draws too much attention and her mobster boyfriend finds her . this ends up in a wild chase by the sisters through a las vegas casino . maggie smith is always a good choice for any role but she is wasted a bit as the mother superior . the best supporting roles goes to the three sidekick nuns mary patrick , mary roberts , mary lazarus - kathy najimy , newcomer wendy makkena and the proverbial nun mary wickes ( this is her third of four times as basically the same character and she ended her career as a gargoyle on notre dame . ) this is a sit back and enjoy film , no messages , not much to think about . dvd extras : inside sister act - a very standard 12 minute making of featurette with director emile arolino , the sisters mary wickes , kathy najimy and wendy makkena and star whoopi goldberg . music videos - if my sister 's in trouble by lady soul and i will follow him by delores and the sisters .
