review of arthur 's lost library book i recommend this dvd for family viewing to everyone . my kids , ranging from 5 years old to 14 years old , still enjoy watching the series . since there is not much of a selection for family viewing on our local stations , we decided to create a dvd library . this was one voted by the kids as well as the parents to have . the three episodes included in this dvd edition are : ( 1 ) arthur 's lost library book-about arthur losing the latest scare-your-pants-off book from the library ; ( 2 ) d.w. 's imaginary friend-d.w. 's new imaginary friend , nadine , moves into the house and follows d.w everywhere , even to the amuzement park , much to arthur 's dislike ; ( 3 ) d.w. 's libary card-about d.w. getting her first library card .
