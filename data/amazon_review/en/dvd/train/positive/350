laura , a name to be remembered ! i first saw laura as a young woman , but i had not seen it for many years . however , the aura of laura remained with me through those years . i decided to buy it after i had seen a screening of it . i was reminded of why i liked it so much . the stars are real and convincing . gene tierney was beautiful as the mysterious laura . dana andrews was handsome and to my present-day eyes , very convincing as the astute detective mcpherson . vincent price is a real charmer as the erstwhile fiance shelby . clifton webb is charming as he always was as waldo . otto preminger was a wonderful director and kept the story tight and convincing with all of his characters . the scenery was limited and tightly held . i was particularly intrigued by the rain ; it rained constantly , and some of the most interesting dialogue occurred during the various rainstorms . laura has become my most watched dvd because i 'm constantly seeing little things that i missed before . in addition , i adore the apartments of laura and waldo because they were decorated then pretty much as i want to decorate now . waldo 's bathroom is to die for . incidentally , i watch the extended version because i love looking at gene tierney 's wardrobe .
