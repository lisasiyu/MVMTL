haunted castle ( 3-d ) this dvd is more like an experince/ride , that can be enjoyed over and over the story is good and the visuals are incredible cgi , imax does not skimp on the wow factor . i own several 3d movies and this is my favorite . for the best experiance in projecting shutter glasses movies use a lcd projector not a dlp projector
