one of hollywood 's most uplifting moments the story of brando 's charactor 's decision to fight for whats right regardless of personal consequences . but to me the star of the show is karl malden who plays a catholic priest willing to put his life on the line to live as christ told him to . his speach following the murder in the cargo-hold is one of the most inspirational moments in all cinema .
