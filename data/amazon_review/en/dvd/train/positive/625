a nice mental exercise for geeks i watched the director 's cut version twice and still could n't figure out what was going on in the movie . only after i went through the commentary , did everything ( except for one thing ) make sense . i doubt anyone could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet . if the audience does n't `` get it '' by watching the movie alone , i say it is a failure on the film maker 's part . that said , i was intrigued by it . i guess the challenge of figuring it out is what attracts geeks ( i consider myself one ) everywhere to this movie . when you finally `` get it '' , it becomes a wonderful movie . just one thing that still does n't make sense though , when the jet engine ( the artifact ) appears in the primary universe at the end of the movie , does n't it make it a tangent universe ? does n't the clock start ticking again , only this time , it would n't be donnie who saves it
