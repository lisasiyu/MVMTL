just delicious ! this is one of my favorite movies ! tom ewell is a hoot as richard sherman , a man with an overactive imagination . we do n't believe him for a minute when he swears to himself he is not going to smoke , drink , etc . while his wife and son are away because we know he does n't have the will power . he really wants these things , yet seven years of marriage has ingrained his wife 's nagging into his conscience . his wife 's voice is always there and he is now no longer able to go through a day and complete simple tasks without constantly grappling with himself for permission . and then marilyn monroe moves in upstairs for the summer . is there no mercy ? monroe and ewell are great , wilder keeps up the pace and the supporting parts are spot-on . wonderful ! the picture has been restored and is presented widescreen , so you can not go wrong .
