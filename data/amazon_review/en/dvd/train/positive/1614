great samurai movie with roots in american detective fiction yojimbo ( the bodyguard ) is a samurai movie based in the detective novels of dashiell hammett - particularly red harvest . akira kurosawa wanted to bring the best of literature and interpret it into japanese cinema . its interesting that the two main influences in this process were hammett 's hard-boiled detective fiction and william shakespeare ( ran , throne of blood ) . the always-excellent toshiro mifune plays the nameless title character who schemes and plots of take down an entire town of gamblers and gansters . i wo n't recap the story , suffice to say that his plans lead into several battles and some beautifully choreographed sword fights . yojimbo was later made ( nearly scene-for-scene ) into a fistfull of dollars by sergio leone with clint eastwood as `` the man with no name . '' bruce willis brought the character back to it 's ganster/detective roots with the not-so-good `` last man standing . '' yojimbo is awash with cinematic violence , but the charm infused into the movie by the cynical , yet obstinately principled , hero surprised me when i first saw it . the performances of the supporting cast , as usual with kurosawa 's films , add depth and wit to each scene . for what its worth , yojimbo has gradually become one of my favorite movies . if you end up enjoying yojimbo , check out the seven samurai , sword of doom , miller 's crossing , the maltese falcon , and the thin man . criterion did an excellent job with their recent re-release of kurosawa 's the seven samurai , and they gave the same treatment to both yojimbo & sanjuro . a new ( and improved ) translation , commentary from steven price , as well as documentary film focusing on kurosawa during the time he was making these great movies . this review is modified from my review of the yojimbo/sanjuro double dvd pack , each movie is great , but i 'd recommend picking up both
