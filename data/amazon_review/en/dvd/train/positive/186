endearing sequel this is an impressive sequel and a very good looking follow-up to anne of the green gables . it is great to see megan follows as anne shirley once again . megan follows is just perfect in this role . anne shirley is now a bit older , has become a teacher and is quite involved in a society away from her rural settings . this gradual progression of characters and story from this original is very welcome and enjoyable . it is very endearing in many ways as was the original
