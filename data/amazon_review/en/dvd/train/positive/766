amy tan 's wonderful work brought to life this movie has stayed with me since i first saw it almost 8 years ago . i 'm very happy to have found it to add to my collection . this movie explores the complex relationship between mother and daughter . and though the story focuses on chinese mothers and their american daughters , the struggles are timeless and so is the love
