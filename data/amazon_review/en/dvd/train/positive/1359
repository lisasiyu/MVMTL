the battle of the banter -- hepburn and grant make this a `` holiday '' worth taking there was a big controversy earlier this year with `` the cary grant box set '' which is a great collection in its own right . many people were upset that it included the first release of `` holiday '' which was new to dvd ( unlike the other films in the collection ) , but no stand alone disc was being offered . well , good news . if all you wanted was `` holiday '' and you held out , here it comes ten months later . now , i 've always had a soft spot for `` holiday . '' it has n't achieved quite the classic status as a couple of other hepburn and grant pairings -- '' the philadelphia story '' and `` bringing up baby '' -- but i actually think that works to its advantage . i might get into trouble for this , but i somewhat prefer this to the more antic `` bringing up baby '' ( do n't shoot me , i know it 's a great film too ) . cary grant plays a carefree soul that becomes engaged to a millionaire 's spoiled , socialite daughter . he is expected to take life more seriously and responsibly -- but that 's not necessarily in his master plan . grant , as always , is charming -- the quips and physicality that were his trademark are used to good effect here . katherine hepburn , as the girl 's sister , is obviously a better match for him ! hepburn uses her rapid fire delivery and plays smart and wry better than anyone else in her era . of course , grant and hepburn have great chemistry and it 's a joy to see these two masters banter . there 's plenty of slapstick , but part of `` holiday '' 's charm is that it balances this with real romance . it 's funny and sweet . any fan of grant , hepburn , director george cukor , classics and/or screwball comedy needs to check this film out . it 'll make you smile . kgharris , 10/06
