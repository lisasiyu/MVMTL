how do you say great movie this movie was one of the better movies i 've ever seen . as far as cute guys , great story-line , and talent go it 's all that ! i ca n't believe how ne1 could not like it . i think it sends a very positive message out about racial issues . and the movie also is n't mushy at all considering it 's a drama . if u like or dis like basketball it does n't matter because it 's still a great movie no matter what ! :
