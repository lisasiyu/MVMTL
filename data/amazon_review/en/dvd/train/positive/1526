great movies ! although i have n't bought this package , i 've seen both films . the first film was really great , it earned 5/5 stars right off the back . the fight scenes were intense , with some great , upbeat music playing . in addition to the intensity , there was a lot of first-person views . there there was a cliffhanger ending , though . the second film was ok , but not as good as the first one . it continues the first one , but they used totally different actors to play raiden , sonya , jax , and johnny cage . i would give it a 4/5 stars because of the short fight scenes and over-use of slow motion . i would have given it a 3/5 , but it earned a star for the awesome music . it was pretty good film , for those who appreciate the hard work of others
