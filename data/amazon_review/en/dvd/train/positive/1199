if this movie does not completely inspire you , you are an idiot . what else can i say ? sixth sense was bearable , the village was not . signs was the stupidest movie ever made . lady in the water was an emotional roller coaster that made even the harshest cynic in our family weep with sorrow and laugh till he cried , often transfering directly from one to the other . paul giamatti could n't be better
