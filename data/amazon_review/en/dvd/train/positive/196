not your typical all american flik this film is so sweet and whimsical . the cultural aspects depicted in the film are what amused me the most . the two love stories intertwined into one main plot is very well put together . this has been my favorite film for several years now and just watching it again made me remember just how much i love it . i highly recommend this international film for those who like to venture into other cultures for entertainment . this is a must see ! love some of the music as well !
