in search of the populism as new ! the search for the forgotten average man as a publicity stunt require by a newspaper , and how backfired . a luxurious cast , headed for gary cooper ( one of his best achievements ) and barbara stanwyck ( superb as always ) , a brilliant script and a gifted director makes of this film an exceptional picture .
