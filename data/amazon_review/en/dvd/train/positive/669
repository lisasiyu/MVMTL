a must-have and must-see if i had to choose one movie to show and teach students the secrets of great actors-directing , it would be this one . the destiny of peter bogdanovich is amazing : celebrated as one of the world 's best directors in the early 70s , he fell into disgrace because of private problems in the 80s , and rarely got a chance to direct anymore except for tv . somehow it reminds me of the destiny of wim wenders , also celebrated as the new big thing in the 70s , and much disregarded today . both judgements were excessive . they probably were n't the best directors in the world in the 70s - but surely are n't the worst today . this movie is a little , much under-rated and overlooked , certainly humble and understated gem . bogdanovich shows here what it means to direct actors in a way that enhances their performances and brings out deep emotions . this is not a superficial movie . instead , it is one that bears repeated viewings . and it has much of what life has : truth , emotions , changes . i especially like the ending . it seems to get back to the beginning , but it 's not . somehow , everything is there , but everything has changed forever . it 's a happy ending , but bittersweet too . and like real life , it goes on , on a road where you ca n't follow , just like those friends you had and never met again , or just like your past memories . i 've been waiting for a decade to get a dvd of this movie . and i bought it immediately as it came out , because it is really unsure that they may ever reprint this once the first bunch is gone . so get it , do n't miss it , this is the best advice i can give . do n't miss the experience of this movie . this is no special fx movie . this is actors cinema at its best . something rare
