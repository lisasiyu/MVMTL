must see it to understand what it is to live in caracas an x-ray of the venezuelan way of living . only after seeing this movie , which might seem like fiction but it is not , one can understand what it is to live in a latin american city like caracas : a city packed with drugs , violence and corruption - where regular citizens are on their own with no protection whatsoever . the sad part is that for us , venezuelans , watching this film feels `` too close to home '' . i know at least 8 people who have gone thru similar experiences
