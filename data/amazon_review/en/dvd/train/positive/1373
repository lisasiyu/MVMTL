funny but typical this seems to follow a typical pattern of danny kaye movies : a zero turns into a hero . however , you 'll also find laughable moments like kaye 's other works . it 's funny , but it 's not one of his best movies . if you could see this for free , i 'd recommend watching it . otherwise , you might want to watch one of kaye 's other , higher quality movies .
