a favorite ! this is one of my all-time favorite movies ! the atmosphere is dreamlike - expressed in the boy 's sleepwalking and the unrepressable subconscious - a thing that communism disavows . thus , the boy 's very being becomes an expression of natural defiance toward the coming communist regime under tito and its spirit-crushing regime . a classic flic . highly recommended
