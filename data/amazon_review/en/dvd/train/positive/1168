a real treat of a movie , and an important one , as well . the firemen 's ball is one of a handful of czech films that defined the & quot ; new wave & quot ; era , and had a profound influence on filmmakers and critics around the world . other important films of this period include forman 's & quot ; loves of a blonde , & quot ; jiri menzel 's & quot ; closely watched trains , & quot ; and & quot ; larks on a string & quot ; ( a menzel film that has n't been released on dvd , to my knowledge ) . but firemen 's ball is a personal favorite , probably due to the fact that i lived in the czech republic for five years , and attended similar village balls . the characters in this wicked satire are portrayed with humor , affection and above all a level of realism that remains unsurpassed . in the end , forman does what he does best -- he leaves you torn between laughter and tears . this film is a must-see , especially for those who are interested in understanding how filmmaking evolved in the 60s
