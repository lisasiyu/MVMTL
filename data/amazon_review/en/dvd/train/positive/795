heartwarming , good for all ages i remember watching anne of green gables when i was a little girl with my sister , over and over again . laughing everytime anne broke her slate on gilberts head , or when she accidently dyed her hair green , or when she waxes poetic about her `` bosom friend '' . it made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old . i would recommend this movie for anyone young or old . it is a beautiful heartwarming movie , with gorgeous scenery , unforgettable characters , and plenty of moments to laugh and cry
