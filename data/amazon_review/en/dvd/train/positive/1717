brother review i was n't sure what i would think of this movie , but i found it to be an interesting snapshot of post-soviet russian life . it showed how easy it is to slip into criminal life when the opportunity presents itself . the movie was also an interesting discussion on morality . danila was not a bad guy , though he did fit into the criminal world well . he still did what he could for those who had nothing . it was , at times , hard to reconcile the cold-blooded killer and the compassionate young man . the movie showed and interesting dynamic between the two danilas . there was also the family dynamic ; his brother was willing to put danila 's life in danger . desperate times call for desperate measures . overall , the movie was entertaining . it was heavy , but with a few lighter spots so the viewer does n't get overwhelmed .
