witty light romantic fare taken for what it intends , this a great film . formulaic ? yes , but it 's a formula done well . ridley scott and russell crowe demonstrate that light-hearted romantic stories do not require a gut-wrenching tragedy or rivalry to propel a plot . pour yourself a glass of red wine ( the good stuff ) and relax as you enjoy charming characters in breathtaking scenery . a good vacation from reality for a couple of bucks at your local vdeo store
