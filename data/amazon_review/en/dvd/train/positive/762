unique ( one of a kind ) film here 's yet another film i saw as a young lad . but this is n't just any western comedy ... it 's got that special something that only comes around ever now and then . terance hill does a great job as trinity . for instance in the opening scene trinity has to sit and eat a whole pan of beans , which he puts away quite quick ... i read on his website that he starved himself for 24 hours in order to do that scene . this is also a film the whole family could watch and enjoy . i would also recommend trinity 's third film `` my name is nobody '' which stars henry fonda . anyway ... if you like good western fun then i would say buy this dvd and enjoy
