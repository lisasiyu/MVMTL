leaves an impression zero woman rocks ! ! ! miki sugimoto is absolutely gorgeous and strong as rei , zero woman , a different brand of cop that will do anything to put away scum . after she murders , the first secretary of the embassy whose really a rapist lowlife , she gets put in prison . the president 's daughter gets kidnapped and the cops desperate to get her back bring back rei to do the job they ca n't do . amazingly over the top exploitation mixed with decent acting , a nice soundtrack and special effects . rei has her moments as well rubbing it to people who really deserve it . she 's without pity and compassion and when you see what happens to her you realize why . this is a great guilty pleasure that really needs to be seen . only five reviews so far ? anybody whose reading this review who has n't seen it needs to go out and buy it
