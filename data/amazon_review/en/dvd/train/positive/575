oh , yes ... take me back to '59 yes , please take me back to 1959 , to new york in 1959 , or even back to rio de janeiro , a couple of years before , where i met rona jaffe practically every single night at the then world-famous `` sacha 's '' nightclub , where rona was already drafting her novel mentally ... when the film started shooting the exteriors in front of the seagram 's building , one could actually walk-up to lovely suzy parker and chat with her about how real was the `` new morality '' of the liberated new york girls in the executive suites , decades before sex and the city became the post-mortem of the sexual revolution of the sixties . at night we had the many parties thrown by negulesco and his charming wife , while stephen boyd was being charming to my wife , brazilian actress mariza woodward , featured in life magazine as one of the most beautiful gals in rio . oh , yes , take me back ! and if you were not there then , if you were not even born then , do get this dvd and visit new york 1959 and see how charmingly it all started , despite where it eventually ended
