liked the better the 2nd and 3rd time i watched it . i have to admit that my expectations were high for this movie and i was initially disappointed . the plot was unrealistic and the ending far-fetched . since i had bought it , i watched it again and found that it was one of those movies that needs to be watched more than once because the enertainment is in the one liners and very funny scenes . watch it again . it is hilarious . -gooosfrab
