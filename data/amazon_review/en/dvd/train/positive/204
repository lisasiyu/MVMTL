another toshiro mifune classic this is a really great movie . and another one of the many , many great movies by the late toshiro mifune . it is both a comedy and an action movie rolled into one . enough has already been written by so many reviewers about this movie that i do n't think i could add any more but to say that this belongs in every cinema collection . thank goodness it is part of the criterion collection . kurosawa definetly had a sense of humor when he made this movie . with mifune selling his services to both of the warring clans , you know there 's going to be hell to pay . this film never disappoints the viewer , and after years of repeated viewing , it never disappoints me . highly recommended
