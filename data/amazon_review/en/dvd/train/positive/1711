the frieza saga begins ... . and it is really good . this dvd is great cause it continues where the namek and ginyu sagas left off and sets up the frieza saga . it is a great segway . this dvd also resolves some things left from the saiyan saga . alot happens but i wont ruin it for you . you really should buy this dvd but buy it with frieza : transformation for a real treat
