the funniest skit i 've ever seen this dvd contains quintessential monty python skits , with spam all over the place . but , this review focuses on one skit on this dvd , which is the skit that made me laugh more than anything else i 've ever seen . the hungarian phrasebook is skit is basic on a simple premise : hungarian immigrants to england need english translations of basic phrases needed in everyday life . but , sinister forces are afoot , and a not-so-innocent phrasebook is published . the skit shows the devastating effects of this nefarious deed , as john cleese portrays a proper hungarian gentleman going into a tobacconist 's shop and . . . i do n't what to spoil it . but , the end result had me laughing until i cried . *da dolphin boy ponders a similar dolphin-human phrasebook , but rejects the idea as potentially fatal to human-cetacean relations
