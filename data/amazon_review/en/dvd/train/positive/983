crackling humor and sad ending makes a great film after seeing brokeback mountain , i decided to see more of ang lee 's films and came upon this gem that perfectly shows the same type of sad melencholy used in brokeback . the film takes place in the 1970 's and centers around two family 's the hoods ( consisting of kline , allen , ricci , and mcguire ) and the carvers ( consisting of weaver , wood , and that one kid ) who go through many events that boil together one night during an ice storm . the husband of the hoods is having an affair with weavers character , the kids are exploring sex and drugs , and allens character goes from shop-lifting to cheating on her husband too . the film plays out in two parts , the first hour or so is mainly a comedy while the last hour plays like a drama that leads to a very sad ending . truly a great ang lee film , must check it out if you loved brokeback
