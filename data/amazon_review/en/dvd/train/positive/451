a real feel good movie this is an awesome mid 80 's teen movie , with a name that really does n't match the film . janie glen ( sarah jessica parker ) is a military brat who relocates to chicago , the home of her favorite tv show dance tv . she immediately makes friends with the ultra cool lynn stone ( helen hunt ) . janie and jeff are paired up as partners for the finals , they have friction which develops into good chemistry . this is such an amazing 80 's teen flick . it also features shannon dougherty as jeff 's little sister , holly gagnier ( the old cassie from one life to live ) , and jonathen silverman ( single guy , gim me a break ) . the dvd does n't include any extras to my knowledge but it does give you the option to view it in full screen or wide screen version , which i thought was pretty cool . this is a real feel good movie ! it really has nothing to do with the song though , and when the song is played in the movie , it 's not cyndi lauper singing ! it was the 80 's and this was after footloose , flash dance , breakin ' , and maybe slam dance , not sure about that last one , but maybe they thought it would be good not to have the dance theme related to the title , but this is totally a movie about a big dance contest and there are several dance scenes , practices , and lots of other teen angst moments ( jeff 's father wanting him to go to trade school , jeff 's sister 's insecururities , janie 's strict father , the spoiled enemy chick ) sprinkled throughout the film . if you have n't seen it , check it out
