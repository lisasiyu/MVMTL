take on `` 10 '' my take is that this is dudley 's best movie , better than both `` authurs '' . while funny , risque and cute for the collective conscious of the late '70s , the scene sequences appear rather hackneyed and pale in the 2000s . the plot is mediocre . the greatness of the movie lay in dudley moores registration of wit shown by his mercurical , elegant and moving use of facial expressions and repartee with brian denehey at the bar and especially at the piano , revealing both great depth of feeling and consumate artistry as a musician . this piano scene , alone reason for 5 stars , was the saving grace .
