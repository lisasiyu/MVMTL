i agree , this is a great intro to tai chi push hands i 've always wondered what push hands was - this video explains that in great detail and teaches how to learn in a very gradual manner . i got my copy last week ( ... ) im glad i finally found this dvd , because it shows exactly what i was looking for - i once saw two women 'pushing hands ' in the park and was fascinated , but have never found a video on the subject until now . nice sound and picture , and dr yang seems to be a very nice teacher
