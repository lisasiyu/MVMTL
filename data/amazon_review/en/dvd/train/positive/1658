great movie , but ... this is a ridiculous price . i would have bought this long ago , but the price just stays at that ridiculous price . i have n't seen the film in years , and would really love to watch it again . but for this price , that 's nuts . i paid less for some film collections . what in the world is criterion doing by asking for so much money for this ?
