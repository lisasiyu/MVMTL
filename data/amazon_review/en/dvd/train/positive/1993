all in all , pretty good all the little animals follows the off-kilter adventures of bobby platt ( christian bale ) , a young man who 's been left a simpleton by the long-ago car accident that damaged his brain but not his soul . he wholeheartedly loves animals and he 's got a pet mouse named peter , but bobby has to keep peter hidden from his wicked stepfather , de winter ( daniel benzali ) . unable to handle de winter 's abuse any longer bobby runs away , hitchhiking from london to cornwall , where he meets mr. summers ( john hurt ) . summers is a quiet man who 's devoted his life to giving dead animals a reverent burial , and he trains bobby to follow in his footsteps . even though the movie 's title is all the little animals , there are n't any developed animal characters . peter is cute , but he 's out of the picture pretty quick . the rest are corpses , or depicted in wistful dream sequences ( the fox is a fixture , and there 's also an otter , a horse and a beaver ) . the human characters are sort of one-dimensional - particularly the fat - but the actors are all superb . benzali and hurt 's reputations precede them , but bale is very underrated . that may change when his high-profile role of batman hits the big screen , but as of now the general public does n't know him . he 's an actor of great range , proven by his equally convincing portrayals of simple and sweet bobby platt in all the little animals and diabolical , murderous patrick bateman in american psycho shortly after . staci layne wilson author of staci 's guide to animal movie
