reflections of amish life . i was born and raised in mansfield , ohio -- now living in anaheim , california -- last 40 yrs. -- a gal i work with-her sister just bought a home in stow , ohio -- which is near ohio 's amish area -- living in mansfield , ohio-i grew up doing sunday family car rides to the amish area of ohio -- i have my own videa of the amish train ride from my last visit to ohio -- i wanted another video for my gal at work to watch and appreciate what her newly located to ohio sister can see of the amish area , so purchased above video so could share with gal at work -- she was amazed what a relaxing lifestyle amish people have -- we took a mini vacation while watching above video -- the order arrived on time and in good condition . thank you
