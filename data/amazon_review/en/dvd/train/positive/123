leaves you wanting more everyone remembers the 1963 series where dr. richard kimble ( david janssen ) goes running around in every episode just missing the criminal that killed his wife . he in turn is being chased by lt. philip gerard ( barry morse ) who thinks kimble did it and is a fugitive from the law . the whole thing was narrated by william conrad . well now we have the movie . this time we have a beginning middle and ending all in 161 minutes . dr. richard kimble ( harrison ford ) and his wife helen ( sela ward ) are the perfect couple . then one night while he was working for some inexplicable reason a despicable person dispatches helen . on her way to the netherworld she inadvertently says richard on the 911 call . one thing leads to another and kimble gets the blame . in the process of transporting him from one containment system to another the transport meets with a little accident ; now kimble is free to find locate the real perpetrator . now it is up to marshal samuel gerard ( tommy lee jones ) to find and retrieve kimble . now that we have covered the basic there is not where to begin to tell how great this movie is on many levels . the anticipation of the chase of kimble to find the perpetrator ( by the way he has only one arm ) before gerard catches him . we get close and have a few read herrings . tommy lee gets to keep his stoic look as he says things like `` i do n't care . '' and `` i do n't bargain . '' personaly i think that the chicago police knew all along who the real bad guy was and was covering for him several times right up to the end . they went out of there way to paint kimble as the bad guy . detective rosetti ( joseph f. kosala ) also tried to stop him from revealing the real perpetrator . rosetti referring to kimball even after the truth is revealed `` he 's going down . you wo n't help us , you stay the hell out !
