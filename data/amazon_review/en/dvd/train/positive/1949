the teacher we all wanted , or wanted to be ... i have always had a soft spot in my heart for this film and its cast . itself an imitator of earlier movies , such as `` blackboard jungle '' in which sidney was a student , not the teacher , it has had dozens if not scores of would-be successors as `` the '' flick about unorthodox teachers saving troubled students . however , i ca n't think of any which have come after that i wanted to see twice -- -not `` up the down staircase '' or `` dangerous minds '' or the one about the calculus teacher or the one about principal joe clark or the one with jim belushi or the one with tom berenger as the substitute or even the recent one with hillary swank , which was pretty good once it got going . `` to sir with love '' is the standout in a very large group . it had cast chemistry and charm and sweetness and an offbeat innocence . and we still need `` life skills '' classes as mandatory offerings in american high schools , an idea that this film was , i believe , the first to champion , despite its being set in great britain
