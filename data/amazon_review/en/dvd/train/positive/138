`` he found himself yearning to know of their affairs '' , directed by saul dibbs , this opulent adaptation of alan hollinghurst 's the line of beauty - his decadent coming of age novel about love , class , sex and money set in the hypocritical thatcherite eighties - is indeed a feast for the eye . beautifully acted , with a spot-on affinity for detailing time and place , the line of beauty replicates hollinghurst 's hedonistic themes and the moral quandaries of nick guest ( dan stevens ) , the titular middle-class outsider in this world of privilege . as with the book , this film adaptation begins in 1983 when the young twenty-year-old nick guest is asked by his friend toby fedden ( oliver coleman ) to come and stay with his family in their sumptuous notting hill home in the kensington park gardens estate . gerald fedden ( tim mcinnerny ) is a sycophantic tory member of parliament who is on the rise , and is basking in the glory of thatcher 's economic policies . gerald lives with loyal wife rachel ( alice krigg ) , his daughter catherine ( hayle atwell ) , and toby . nick 's comes from a provincial , terribly middle class background - his father is a humble antiques dealer - but he is welcomed into the fedden family like a type of surrogate son and over time , he becomes a kind of minder to the neurotic and troubled catherine . nick is wined and dined , enthusiastically partaking of the family 's lavish parties and political dinners , trying to impress them in their superficial discussions on literature , art and antiques . nick tries his best to promote civility amongst their affluent boredom , but he 's unsure of his footing in this opulent , prosperous looking-glass world . in fact , dan stevens plays nick with a kind of wide-eyed , eloquent fury , always nicely mannered , but forever hidden is the ever-present pretension and affectation , and as he gazes hopefully into the gilt arch of the hall mirror , this troubled man finds it reluctant to give its approval . nick constantly has to remind himself that he is doing this all for pleasure , yet when he falls in love with leo , ( don gilet ) a lusty black cockney and socialist council worker , he finds himself caught in a jamesian-like dilemma , wedged between the powerful , privileged life led by the feddens and their friends , whilst also having to face the stark realities of eighties britain - the vast unemployment and the rise of aids . the second and third episodes of the series feature nick 's relationship with wani ( alex wyndham ) , a long-lashed lebanese millionaire playboy . while working as a creative consultant on wani 's new magazine , ogee - named after the curve that is hogarth 's line of beauty - nick is introduced to a world of non-stop threesomes , moneyed decadence , and cocaine-fueled days and nights . and of course this all culminates in the beautifully recreated coke-fuelled dance with `` the lady '' herself , the prime minister , margaret thatcher ( kika markham ) . this bbc adaptation follows hollinghurst 's book pretty much to the letter , although in some instances , the film fails to catch much of the subtleness and nuance of the source material . the scenes involving nick 's sex and coke binges in the toilets and bedrooms of his grand surroundings seem hurriedly cut short , and the pivotal scene of the dreary piano recital fails to capture the tiniest social shenanigans and inherent boredom of all the guests as well as it could . also , when the fedden 's take nick on their holiday to france , the pacing slows a bit , but thankfully picks up speed again in readiness for the final dï¿½nouement , the penultimate dance with the lady . the cast is solid throughout , but stevens is without a doubt the standout , imbuing nick with a neediness and an obvious desire to be loved . he speaks his emotions and is in need of reassurance of his place within the fedden household . he exists in a limbo space of not quite belonging , and in innocence of the dark undertones of the world he has entered . amidst the euphoria of first love , champagne and high society parties , the young graduate witnesses political scandal , deception , and the ultimate hypocrisy towards his sexuality , and that of his bretheren . the unsaid mantra is that it does n't matter what you do , as long as you keep it quiet and do it in private . the line of beauty is indeed a richly textured coming-of-age story , and accomplished adaptation of a classic work of literature set against the backdrop of a ruthless decade of change and transformation . mike leonard october 06 .
