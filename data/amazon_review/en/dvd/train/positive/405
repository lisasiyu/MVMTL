it 's a right kerfuffle ! little britain is quite simply the funniest comedy out there today . i laughed till i cried . these guys are amazing and have created unforgettable characters that you want to see again and again , in new surroundings dealing with their same problems , like we all must do . if you have a strong stomach and a courageous sense of humor , you will love little britain
