so many memories ... i am so glad that family ties , season 1 is out on dvd . this show makes my mind flood with memories from high school . it gives me such a nostalgic feeling watching the keatons ' shenanigans from season 1 . i surely hope that other season sets follow soon . the show got better and better as the seasons rolled by in my opinion . i 've read the reviews which mention the intro music changes . in my opinion , it really does n't change the quality of the episodes at all . i have been looking forward to this series release for such a long time , that it would have taken a lot more that the music changes for me to be disappointed . but , hey , to each his own feelings . i love the show and my boxed set of family ties : season 1
