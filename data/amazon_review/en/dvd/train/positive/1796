funny , but not sure how `` ironic '' she really is miss silverman is the most recent addition to the group of `` meta-bigot '' comedians -- i.e . comics who tell ethnic jokes supposedly for their `` shock '' value , while hiding behind a screen of supposed irony -- which includes dave chappelle , carlos mencia , chris rock , and the writers of south park . i find it odd that she gets away with telling so many black jokes and throwing around the `` n '' word so much . i think it has a lot to do with the fact that she is attractive , female and jewish . if larry the cable guy ever said the `` n '' word on a comedy dvd , i guarantee you that al sharpton would already be carrying his head around on the end of a stick . keep in mind that silverman has been dating jimmy kimmel of `` the man show '' fame for many years . though i am a female , i did truly enjoy the man show , though i thought it was n't as ironic as many people would have you believe . anti-pc `` irony '' is really a protective screen for telling the kind of jokes most people only tell among themselves , and do n't have the gonads to do so in public . anyone who can appreciate humor knows there 's a difference between comedy and hate , but many are so sensitive that they ca n't tell the difference .
