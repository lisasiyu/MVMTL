best of judd nelson judd nelson has made some good movies and some not so good . i count this as one of his best . as an attorney `` stormy weathers '' he ca n't be beat . he will stretch the limits of courtroon etiquette well past the limit if it will win his case . this is by far one of the best melodramas i have seen . not often do we see a movie full of comedy and drama at the same time . the beginning is very light stuff , but midway into the movie we start to see the darkside of humanity . john hurt turns in a magnificent performance as judd 's client in a murder case . judd ca n't decide if his client is innocent or guilty , but once he knows for sure he has to learn new tactics in dealing with the judicial system . fans of courtroom movies should enjoy this even if they are not fans of the 80s bratpack . great directing and excellent cast make this a winner . a nice soundtrack and scenes in boston do n't hurt either . good quality dvd but no extras
