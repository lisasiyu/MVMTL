this dvd is a must ! ! ! ! i 've been studying pilates and gyrotonics for six years with some of the top instructors in nyc but with the increasing popularity of pilates , the sessions have gotten absurdly expensive , which is why i wanted to try a dvd . i have never been one to work out in my home , but ths is truly an amazing workout and not only have i saved so much money by doing this dvd instead of my beloved studio sessions , but i 'm able to incorporate it into my busy schedule and do it much more often than i ever could with the sessions . as the reviews before me have indicated , the dvd is broken up into four segments that each target a specific area , but i think that 's slightly misleading . while about sixty or seventy percent of the exercises in each section do target the area they are labeled under , each section also contains a variety of stretches and counter-workouts as well , which make for a more overall workout , whether you 're doing one section or four at a time . for instance , in the section entitled `` abs '' you 'll also find exercises that strengthen the back muscles and legs . therefore , you 're able to get a lot of variety and a great overall workout ! ******note : i recommend this highly for intermediates and advanced students of pilates , but not for beginners ! ! ! in order to do these exercises correctly , you must know the basic pilates foundation such as pelvic placement , breathing techniques , and proper alignment . if you are attempting these exercises as a beginner , they may seem straightforward , but without the proper foundation and knowledge ( which is not explained ) , you may not be doing the exercises properly and worse , could get hurt . ******* for those who are newer to pilates , i would recommend perhaps watching the video first , as it moves at what i would consider a fast intermediate pace .
