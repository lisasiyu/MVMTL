music maker 's magic pick up most any hit record beginning in the late 1940s , especially any recording done with atlantic records , and you will likely see that one tom dowd was the producer or recording engineer . in this loving tribute to dowd , who died october 27 , 2002 before the film was finished , those inside the guild honor the memory of one whom they universally acknowledge was a legendary genius and wonderful human being . in his younger years dowd was a physics student at columbia , and even worked on the atom bomb project ( he was present at the bikini atoll tests ) , but his mother was an opera singer and perhaps he was destined for music . dowd was a master technical innovator , musical aesthete , coach , father figure , and psychologist . he himself narrates most of the film , but we are also treated to original concert footage ( otis redding , aretha franklin , etc . ) and retrospective interviews with a number of the stars whose sounds he perfected , including ray charles , eric clapton , and greg allman . the five minutes or so when dowd sits at a console and walks us through the thirty-year-old master copy of `` layla , '' starting with only the guitars and then adding the various parts until they pulse with that incredibly evocative sound that defined an era , interspersed with poignant reflections by clapton , are worth the entire film . one disappoint in this otherwise fascinating glimpse of the history of music recording since the late 1940s is that we learn nothing at all personal about dowd , and nothing at all about any weaknesses , failures , misjudgments , and the like , that would have made this entirely likable person even more richly human
