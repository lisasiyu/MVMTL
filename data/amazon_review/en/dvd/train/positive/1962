powerful teen drama i loved this movie from the moment i saw it for sale at my video store 's discard rack ten years ago . i recently received the dvd as a gift and the sound quality is a big improvement over my old vhs copy . i recommend it for performances , the story and the photography . jodie foster 's monologue toward the end of the film is particularly memorable . each girl 's story line is realistic and the film itself does a good job of capturing teen life in the late 70s before yuppie values took hold . this is not a john hughes film and is a refreshing change for anyone who was subjected that director 's teen films in the 80s
