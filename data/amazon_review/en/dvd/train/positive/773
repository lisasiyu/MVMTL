good film good film i was just really able to appreciate this film . sure there were some lines that i did n't like and and i was a little unclear about some plot aspects and i wished we could have seen what happens to the characters after the film ended . but overall , i really loved the message of the film and the originality of it . this is a film about love , sexuality , and relationships . it was really beautiful . most of what i must praise highest is the acting . every single person was casted perfectly for what their unique talents offered . corazza 's is a very believable and truthful actor . his acting lends himself to innocence and sympathy -- just what matt needed . taylor was brilliant . she exudes power and assurance . and she played every one of her very difficult lines absolutely perfectly . she was perfection . allison was surprising convincing and excellent . i say surprising because for a man dressed in woman 's clothing , this is the first movie where i actually liked the character and this character was believable and not a stupid stereotype . shannon was real person for me . boyd was absolutely excellent . she seems to be the most experienced and a clear veteran of the art . they were so lucky to get her for this . she 's a world-class actress . this film was just really enjoyable . i really found the writer 's ( fraser ) commentary to be especially interesting . this film was daring , original , and well-directed . a little unbelievable at points , but enjoyable none the less .
