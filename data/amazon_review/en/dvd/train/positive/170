mag ( nificent ) max with all the drek that video stores carry , it 's amazing that i had to join an online rental service to see `` rushmore '' , the best comedy , and one of the most entertaining movies i 've seen this decade . `` rushmore '' has every aspect of a great movie -- script ( by director wes anderson and writer/actor owen wilson ) , casting ( jason schwartzman got the starring part as max fischer after a long search ; bill murray is perfect as herman blume , and brit olivia williams is lovely as miss cross -- i 'm not sure why she has n't gotten other good parts ; even the minor characters are very well cast ) , direction ( by anderson -- highlighted by the montage of max 's extracurricular activities at the title private school rushmore ) , acting ( see schartzman , murray and others ) , soundtrack ( somehow '60s british invasion works perfectly for this tale from the '90s -- the faces `` ooh la la '' topping everything ) , and a happy , but still satisfying ending . and on top of that , there are plenty of very funny lines and the delight of seeing both `` serpico '' and `` platoon '' produced for the high school stage . max fischer is one of the best young characters created for a movie , and the rest of the great cast and production work beautifully around him . very highly recommended !
