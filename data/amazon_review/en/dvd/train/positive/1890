i ca n't imagine ... ... i 'm the only one who noticed that , besides the satire about managements , unions , and their relations , there is also one , although briefer nonetheless most interesting , about 'justice ' , who decides that if one is guilty of honesty , it can only happen by reason of insanity , and , therefore must be committed . leaving management going on with their cheating schemes , workers thinking that getting their paycheck is working hard enough , and unions ' leaders going on encouraging sabotage , following ussr directions , absolutely blind to the fact that , if doing one tenth of the same stuff in ussr , they would have been -at best- sent to the siberian salt mines used as reeducation camps
