a competitor to the stage show version ... ... . recently my husband , daughter and i went to nyc to see the broadway version of the poto . the show was outstanding and a pleasure to see on stage , but i have read many reviews that criticize this newest film adaptation . i strongly disagree ! this special addition dvd delighted my entire family . i am very impressed with this movie version and highly reccommend it . its depiction of the poto story is evocatively romantic and the music is a `` perfect '' score . the special additions reveal just what lengths andrew lloyd webber , director joel schumacher and their collaborators went through to finally achieve this production . it also contains the evolution of the poto stage show as well as the movie . gerard butler is the ultimate phantom and i was enchanted with his singing . if you love captivating music and romantic movies - buy this dvd
