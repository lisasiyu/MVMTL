it is an ok movie this updated version of this movie is quiet a change from the book . but , just because it is a change from the book is n't a good reason for me not to like it . i did like the movie over all and i thought that the point that the director tried to make came across fine . even though there were no adults there , the children did develop a `` government '' and those differences came out in the group that won compared to the group that lost followers . also , in developing a `` government '' there was a hierachy of leadership and blood shed . see the movie for yourself and come to your own conclusions about the movie . for myself , i did enjoy it and will probably see it again
