the bonzo 's in all their absurd magnificence i gave this video five stars because it is the only thing i 've seen yet that has actual moving pictures of the bonzo dog band . being that they were n't on tv in the us at all during the 60 's , it is quite amazing to be able to see them here in all their original glory . i was completely open mouthed amazed with all of them . vivian of course was a major howl , but the rest of the lads were right up there with him . roger ruskin spear in particular was a major scream . rodney slater was a real oddity as well and legs larry was hilarious . so was neil . it was just so amazingly great to come upon this . like coming upon a time capsule . there is quite a bit of the bonzos throughout these shows . unfortunately , most of it is not done live , however it is fascinating to hear a lot of their songs in developmental stages . there is almost an hour and a half of bonzo material on these disks . there are no chapter stops except for the beginning of each show . there is no copy guard either , so it is possible to assemble all the bonzo clips on your own disc . this is what i did using a hard disc dvd recorder . it all worked out beautifully and made the purchase of these dvd 's very much worth it . as for the comedy bits with all the others on the show , well , there are a few things but it really is truly amazing how much improved things got when the pythons became the pythons . i bought this for the bonzos and it did not disappoint
