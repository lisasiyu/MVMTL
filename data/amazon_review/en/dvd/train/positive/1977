a drop of water i remember seeing this short film as a young child and it scared me so much that now as an adult lover of horror films seeked to purchase it for my family . i am not one who scares easily and this film was frightening . i loved watching it with my husband , because it was so much fun to see him jump during the movie ! i totally recommend renting/purchasing this from the black sabboth trilogy collection . happy haunting ! pam from eagle mountain lake , texa
