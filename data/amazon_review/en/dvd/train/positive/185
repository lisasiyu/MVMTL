great play , must see ! ! this was a great play , deborah cox was wonderful , the singing of all the characters was unbelievable . the interaction between the male characters was hysterical . the character of khalif added just the right amount of spice to the pot without being over the top . all in all a great play about the african american male-female relationship at all different age levels
