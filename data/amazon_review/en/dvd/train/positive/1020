pilates for 50+ with amy brown this is one of many pilates dvds i 've watched . the 20 minute one for beginners ( the only one i use ) is quite good . amy repeats important directions repeatedly and gives gentle reminder not to strain lower back or neck and to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth . this beginner set has been a very good starting point for me and she 's right , i can feel my core getting stronger . the 20 minutes go fast and you learn what your body can do and build from there . i would have liked a better view of the second person , the one i was following when amy suggeted an easier version of the exercise , but you wo n't go wrong buying it
