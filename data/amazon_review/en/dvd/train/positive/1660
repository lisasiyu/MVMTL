intense , brooding , chilling mysteries without doubt the touching evil series is , along with prime suspect , wire in the blood ( also with robson ) , one of the finest mysteries ever developed for television . once again british television leaves its stateside counterpart in the dust when it comes to creating a well-reasoned , educated yet infinitely watchable & quot ; who-done-it ? & quot ; robson green 's creegan has a intensity that is deeply affecting and eminently watchable . just shy of being over-the-edge , creegan is instantly likeable yet worrisome ; like an old friend whom one is justifiably concerned about . yet he 's not so & quot ; out there & quot ; that we find it difficult to identify with him . quite the opposite . nicola walker is his perfect partner , d.i . taylor . like the best entertainment , touching evil is n't a one man show and while the major burden may fall to robson , he is surrounded with a rich and varied supporting ensemble with a genuinely stand out performance from shuan dingwell as d.c. rivers . i 'm glad to see season 1 finally making it to dvd ! dare i wish for & quot ; touching evil iv ? & quot ; p
