`` look at that war wagon roll '' i love john wayne movies and this one is a good one . with friend kirk douglas , wayne plays taw jackson a man sent to prison by bruce cabot for a crime he did n't commit and cabot stole waynes land and his gold mine to boot . now wayne is out and wants payback and the gold . douglas is lomax the gunman who cabot wants to hire to kill wayne , but wayne gets to him first and they become parters in an atempt to rob one of cabots gold shipments in the title wagon . and what a wagon , its armor plated , has a gatlin gun mounted on it and has 12 gunman on horse back riding beside it.this is a very action packed western that has humor to spare and wayne and douglas look to be having the time of their lives together and it just makes the movie pop off the screen with energy . my boys watch this one with me and i 've caught them outside playing like they are in the movie , so this is one of the best reasons i have to add this great western to the collection .
