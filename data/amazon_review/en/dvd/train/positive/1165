deciever is far too overlooked and unnoticed i can not believe the scarcity of people who have actually seen this movie . tim roth is an incredible actor , and his intelligence permeates into a very believable role in a modern mystery/noir with staggering twists and turns of a mental battle between the interrogates and the interrogated . the story pivots the balance of power like no other movie i 've ever seen . it is an exceptinoal psychological thriller that leaves you completely satisfied . i had no complaints with the acting or music ( you wo n't enjoy the ending as much if you do n't like oldies music , however ) , and the story is top notch with a script that plays it out thoroughly . the cinematography is above average , and very in sync with the music to make a great finale , and a great movie
