what causes zombies ? a sailboat arrives in new york harbor . it seems abandoned but a coast guard member is killed by a man on board . the man is shot and falls into the harbor . the boat belongs to a man whose daughter is concerned about him . she and a reporter hire a boat to find her father . their destination is an island said to be cursed . the boat they hire is run by a young couple . along the way the couple do some diving ( she is topless ) . she is scared when she sees a man under the water who attacks a shark and tries to eat it . she is very upset and somehow loses the rest of her suit when removing her tanks . the continue to the island which is just a short distance away . once on the island they discover researchers looking into a phenomena where the dead rise to attack the living . legend says it is the work of voodoo but the lead scientist is convinced there is a medical explanation . unfortunately the missing father has already died but at least now it is known . but soon the zombie trouble gets out of control as cemeteries give up hordes of the walking dead . in the end , only a few manage to escape the island to head back to civilization . they keep one zombie as proof that they are not crazy . this is one of the better zombie films although the final battle is a little odd as zombies seem to appear out of nowhere inside buildings . that aside the story builds nicely with the multiple plots weaving together smoothly . there is plenty of nudity in this one and plenty of gore , although somewhat tame by today 's standards . the acting is reasonable for the effort and special effects are decent . i enjoyed the ending which i gather was supposed to be a shocker but which i predicted from the beginning . my guess is that most viewers will get too caught up in the rest of the movie to think that far ahead , or so the producers hoped . if you like zombie films you will have to check this one out
