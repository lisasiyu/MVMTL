though not a masterpiece , a movie worth watching ! a very good movie , kiss the girls , sheds light on a series of disappearances of young girls in north carolina . there are slight hints of seven , the bone collector , resurrection , and the silence of the lambs so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category , though it is way far removed from that level of gore and horror . morgan freeman , ashley judd ( who is gorgeous ! ) , and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well ! overall , though not a masterpiece it is definitely a movie worth watching , as it will surely provide for an evening 's entertainment .
