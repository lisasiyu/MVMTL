i think some reviewers are missing the point i understand that the holocaust is a sensitive subject to people of all ages , races , religions , gender , and so on . it is important that the world understands how and why this happened , and i commend all people who make an effort to recast and teach the world the terror that so many were subjected to . yes , we all know robin williams to be the slapstick comedian which has brought tears of laughter to our eyes instead of ones of compassion . but like roberto benigni in life is beautiful , williams brings to life a character who tries to lift the spirits of friends and strangers who are looking for one thing , hope . whether williams ' character was real or imaginary , the human spirit can never be completely wiped by tyranny and oppression . 10 million people , including 6 million jews were systematically killed before the nazi 's were finally stopped . some died as fighters , some gave their lives for others , and some gave just simple acts of kindness , good will , and love . each one of them were heroes of their own kind . william 's character told lies about russian troop advancement to give the jews of his ghetto the will to survive and resist . like real life heroes such as rauol wallenberg , oskar schindler , mordecai anielewicz , hannah senesh , and thousands of others who risked their lives for others , this is a story of a good man . maybe this movie was not an exact interpretation of its predecessors , books or movies , and yes it did have some hollywood-like moments . but oeverall , a tribute to the men , women , and children who shall always be remembered and never forgotten
