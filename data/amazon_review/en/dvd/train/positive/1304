finally on dvd i saw this movie many years ago and have been waiting for it to come to dvd . this story is especially relevant today , as the country hears more and more about terrorist cells within our midst . it was interesting to see how an everyday joe trains ( hollywood style ) to become an assassin and to follow the action as he avenges his sweetheart 's death
