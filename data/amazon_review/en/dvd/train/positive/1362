sheer joy ! i 've adored leahy since i stumbled across their first cd , several years ago . afaik , this is their first dvd , and i sincerely hope it 's the first of many . the dvd presents their first broadcast show for pbs . this family puts on a wonderful show , and the music they make is beyond outstanding . they combine traditional cape breton and irish/scottish fiddling syles with updated instrumental accompaniment in a way that injects modern vitality into already wonderful traditional musical styles . and donelle leahy , their lead fiddler , ca n't really be quite human ! do n't neglect to watch the `` additional performances '' section of the dvd -- it was a crime to cut *any* part of this production from the broadcast
