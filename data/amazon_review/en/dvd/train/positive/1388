karma -- clint eastwood style it 's a movie as morally complex as the history of america itself . yes , the town , lago , has blood on its hands . yes , the townspeople have flirted with evil by having three common thugs bullwhip their sheriff to death because he would likely report their mine as located on federal lands and so endanger their ambitions for limitless wealth . yet , the movie also appears to see the town , lago , as worthy of redemption . after railroading the thugs into prison , the town very conveniently proceeds to pretend that nothing ever happened : `` these are god fearing people , '' the new sheriff earnestly tells the high plains drifter . however , when the thugs are released from prison , they seek to receive their back wages in the blood of the townspeople who doublecrossed them . only when the townspeople experience the same terror that their bullwhipped sheriff must have experienced does the high plains drifter reappear to save them from the thugs . indeed , at the end of movie , when the high plains drifter rides away from town on horseback , a tombstone is erected with the name of the murdered sheriff . unlike the outlaws , the townspeople feel a very real sense of collective guilt , which the high plains drifter and their ordeal have reawakened . perhaps that is the hope of america -- that we do have guilt over our past and we do not just pretend that nothing ever happened .
