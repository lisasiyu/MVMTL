totally amazing , this is when american cartoons were nothing short of mind blowing . i just got back into batman after finding out they put batman beyond was in one collection . after that i started to remember why i loved batman so much . so i went out and got all 4 volumes and the last one imo held up the best . it 's been fun revisiting batman again and i hope to see bruce tim make one more series .
