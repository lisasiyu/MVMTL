3 times through after watching this one time through you will either think it was an awesome production of action and effects ( geared towards those with a small attention span and thirst for raw action rather than a good story line ) or that it is a complete mess . i admit that i enjoyed what i thought was mindless entertainment , but at the same time was left slightly disappointed with what i thought was a hollywoodish anime ( not a good thing ) . however i was fortunate to see one ova at a time , therefore i watched the first ova about three times , the second two times and at last all three together ( these three are what make up the contents of this dvd ) . so by the time i finished this first half of the story i pretty much understood it . this dvd entails a complicated kaleidoscope of events that eventually jumble into a collage of a story . honestly this is a very good anime with a very good story once you are able to breath it all in . it appears as a mess because the director throws everything at you almost at once ; however i believe that is what he intends . as the story goes on the knots that make up the story untwine ( ova to ova ) . so expect the first ova to be the most complicated and confusing . but if you read the summary first the story will make more sense the first time you watch it . finally , the animation and cg is second to none . it is an extremely beautiful anime . sooo , i highly recommend reading the summery on the back of the box first
