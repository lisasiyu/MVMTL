on my most favorite list i first picked this up out of the bargain bin at the video store . i was mostly interested in the music . i had seen another movie with a cajun story line called `` southern comfort '' and discovered i loved the music . so , i bought belizaire b/c i wanted to have the music . and make no mistake , the music is great ! but i was majorly surprised at how wonderful the movie is ! i stand in agreement with the other reviewers - this is well worth owning . its one you 'll want to see repeatedly . i know i still enjoy it every time i watch it , and its been many times over the years .
