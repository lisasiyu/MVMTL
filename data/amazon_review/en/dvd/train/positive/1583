i could not have enjoyed this more ! this is simply the perfect movie/series for anyone who is interested in polar exploration . it 's beautifully filmed , interesting throughout , and really makes you feel you are there . true , scott is , on the whole , shown in a less than favorable light , but given many of the decisions he made , it would be hard for that not to be the case . to the film 's credit it goes to great lengths to give the context/history behind the mindset that led to those poor decisions . likewise with amundsen , you see his greatness mixed with his flaws . i would n't change a thing about the movie itself . as to the quality of the film transfer and the sound , it seemed perfectly fine to me - though i 'm hardly an expert on such things . as for the packaging , i admit i was a little disappointed there was absolutely no booklet of any kind , nor are there any `` extras '' on the discs themselves . you strictly get the 7 episodes on 3 discs in a double-wide hard case . but given that exploration is rarely the subject of any movie , let alone one of this length , i consider this set a real find , worth every penny , and i will treasure it . one side note : the dvd case says `` featuring hugh grant & max vonsydow '' , but a very young hugh grant has just a tiny little part in this 1985 film , so do n't buy this hoping to see him or you 'll be disappointed !
