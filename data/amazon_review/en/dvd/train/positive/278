kurosawa 's modern crime drama crackerjack suspense yarn by kurosawa based on the novel king 's ransom by ed mcbain . toshiro mifune plays a rich industrialist distraught at his board of directors who want to make a shoddy product ( shoes ) for a bigger profit ; he mortgages everything he owns to raise the money to buy the company and continue to make a top-quality shoe . but then his son is kidnapped and a huge ransom demanded , only it turns out to be not his son who was kidnapped but the boy he was playing with at the time , his chauffeur 's son . he 's faced with a moral dilemma : should he pay the ransom anyway and be ruined financially , or not ? he decides to pay and get the boy back ; then the police go to work to catch the kidnapper . at this point the movie becomes a fast-paced police procedural . the kidnapper 's motive for committing the crime is not just for the money but to make the rich suffer . mifune is ruined at the end , but public support is behind him . it 's a great crime drama ; only near the end when the chase takes the police into the seamy side of town does the pace lag a bit . what i found most fascinating was how differently the japanese police handled the case from the way american police might - so much more compassionately . definitely worth a watch
