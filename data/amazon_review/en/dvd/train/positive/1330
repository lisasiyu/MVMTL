fun new show i hate math , but this show has given me a great appreciation for it . th cast has great chemistry . i feel like a couple of the fbi agents when charlie is explaining a new math formula , so he puts it in layman 's terms for them ( and me ! ) . whether or not you like crime-based shows , you 'll love this
