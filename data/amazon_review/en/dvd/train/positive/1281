mark dacascos best overall movie to date ! ! ! without a doubt this is mark 's most complete movie to date . the intricate plot , stylish flashbacks , and unique camera angels , makes this more than your average straight to video . tibor tackas shows a very good touch . the ending begs for a sequel , and i would pay money to see it in the theater if one were to be made . this is the type of movie that mark is able to show the moves that have made him the envy of the action genre actors , and object of desire from female fans , but he is also is allowed to actually act and show depth . tibor tackus should be thanked for giving us more mark than i have seen in his previous movies to date , except for & quot ; only the strong & quot ; , which i like equally as well as this
