wa hoo longer ago than i care to remember i had the great fortune to meet einstein . i was an under grad in college when he made one of his unannounced visits to the campus . walter matthau captures the professor briliantly and his humor and wit come through in this film . einstein 's interest in motorcycles and his love of sailing are portrayed lovingly and the very human side of the great man is illustrated with fidelity and humor . it is always on my list of ten favorite films .
