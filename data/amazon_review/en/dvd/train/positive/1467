darryls review on transformers 20th anniversary dvd great movie . to date the best version out there . 2 disc ! it was great watching it with commentary from fans . this was just awesome . the colour and widescreem format are surperb . many special features including commentaries , interviews , trailers etc . the scramble city episode which is a special feature , which i was looking forward to fell below expectations due to the fact you could only watch it with commentary . only about four toy commercials . there are easter eggs on both discs ( old diaclone toy commercials ) . overall a great addition to my dvd collection and fully recommended
