so many great songs ! i saw `` annie get your gun '' again this weekend live on stage . i had forgotten just how many great songs irving berlin wrote for this masterpiece ! -- '' you ca n't get a man with a gun '' , `` the girl that i marry '' , `` doin ' what comes naturally , '' `` anything you can do i can do better , '' `` they say falling in love is wonderful , '' `` i got the sun in the morning and the moon at night , '' and the classic anthem `` there 's no business like show business . `` if you have n't seen or heard this musical , please do yourself a favor and get this film on tape or dvd . afterthoughts : i just read several negative reviews about betty hutton 's portrayal of annie oakley . do not believe them . do not even read them ! some people are `` the glass is half empty '' type of people and negativity is contagious ! betty hutton 's portrayal was , of course , probably directed by the director of the film . so it is `` the director 's portrayal '' ; the director is responsible for what betty hutton did on screen . and , this is not meant to be a `` realistic '' portrayal of a `` real '' person anyway -- -no one alive remembers what annie oakley was really like . so the portrayal by betty hutton ( as directed by her director ) is as good a `` shot at it '' as any other -- -including judy garland 's portrayal . so , i suggest you just accept betty huttons portrayal as `` one among many possible '' and enjoy what the portrayal does have -- -alot of comedic verve and vivacity ! yes , `` the glass is half full '' ..and even more than half ... . in this case . and then there are some reviewers who criticize the show because annie pretends to be a poorer shot than frank near the end to `` get her man '' by letting him win and thus showing his `` shooting prowess '' some respect to make him feel better . i suppose for some people it is `` politically incorrect '' to `` play the male ego game '' . but , is n't `` playing the male ego game '' what it takes sometimes to `` get the man you want ? '' so , was n't annie in the play just being `` realistic '' ? is n't criticizing this aspect of the play `` nit-picking '' . ask yourself , could you even come close to writing a `` masterpiece '' like the musical , `` annie get your gun '' ? if you could n't do it , then what gives you the right to `` nit pic '' the show ? and the indian issue . some people feel indians were disrespected in the show . but , the show i saw has chief sitting bull portrayed as giving good advice to annie and being an intelligent person . in my opinion , whichever way the indians were portrayed in the movie does n't change anything about all the positive aspects of the show . my suggestion is to forget about all the nit-picking and enjoy the show ! and there 's alot to enjoy ! : o ) email boland7214 @ aol.c
