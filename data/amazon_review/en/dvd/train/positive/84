finally on dvd ! yay ! true , this is n't a series for parents looking for advice ( as one of the previous reviewers critiqued ) , but this is my favorite baby show and i am very glad that i can ditch my tapes now that it is out on dvd . there are a great many more episodes than those listed on this single dvd -- let 's hope that this disk is profitable enough so that they decide to sell them all ! the episodes present classic psyc . experiments of developmental perception that are simply facinating . if you are taking an intro . to psycology course and all the dry textbook descriptions are putting you to sleep , get this dvd ! actually looking at the sweet little guys go through the set-ups will help you remember the different cognitive stages . they are just too cute ! and it is neat to see what `` tricks '' you can play on your own little fellow
