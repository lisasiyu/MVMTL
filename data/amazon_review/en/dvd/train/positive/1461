terrific series from bbc , another terrific series . as good as prime suspect , it 's about the on-going core characters - all with their own psychological quirks , strengths and weaknesses as well as the crimes they need to solve . great acting , writing . suspenseful . now waiting for series 3 , 1 & 2 are definately keepers
