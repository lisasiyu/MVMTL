great cast lots of fun . this is not high minded viewing but who cares , it 's freaking pirates . it 's johnny depp being awesome ; with orlando bloom and keira knightley standing around being hot with occasional spurts of acting . geoffrey rush plays the main antagonist and puts out a great performance . this is one of the coolest adventure films to come out in years . if you like movies like the mummy and indiana jones , or just have an abiding love for kinda corny pirate flicks , then this is right up your alley . as far as the presentation of the dvd , it 's clean and the packaging is n't annoying . the menus dont take a long to cycle so you can just watch your movie and relax . if you are the sort that likes special fearure this is a good buy since you get a bunch of behind the scenes info and insights into teh making of the film . i am a sucker for behind teh scenes . overall a good purchase but it seems to be out of stock as of this review . i am sure you can get it off of the amazon marketplace without too much hassle or just wait for a possible boxed set to release after the sequel dvd ( s ) comes out or wait for a restock
