the fine line between the actor 's stage and reality is murder ... . here 's a memorable oscar-winning performance from one of hollywood 's finest actor 's , ronald colman , in a story of jealousy , madness and revenge . in a role that was originally intended for cary grant , colman is excellent as anthony john , a celebrated off-broadway actor who blurs the line between his character , othello , and reality when he starts acting on the murderous impulses of his character . as a psychological melodrama , `` a double life '' undoubtedly stands out as a success . george kukor 's direction is exemplary as he successfully juxtaposes tony john 's real jealousy over his ex-wife 's relationship with edmond o'brien , while mirroring the wracked emotions and madness of shakespeare 's protagonist . colman convincingly protrays tony john 's progressive dementia from the get-go the minute he is offered the part soon after the opening credits roll . for an actor used to playing debonair and swashbuckling heroes in the 30 's this role must have been a challenge for colman , but a welcome one . he brings a nervous intensity to the character of tony john that is never melodramatic but is realistically portrayed . co-written by the talented actress , ruth gordon ( harold & maude ) , `` a double life '' showcases an impressive cast including shelley winters ( in her first professional role ) , ray collins , and signe hasso . the score by miklos rozsa , as well as the screenplay by ruth gordon and garson kanin , are both as memorable as the performances in this remarkable film . this dvd 's transfer is markedly clean and lovingly restored from the original film negative and presented in the original 1.33:1 format in which the the film was initially shot .
