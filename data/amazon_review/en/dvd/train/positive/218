great remake ... dare i say better than the original now , i 'm not trying to hate on the original . obviously , it 's a classic . but , come on . it 's boring . it 's black and white and slow . and i 'm sure it scared your parents and was shocking and all that good stuff . but it needed to be updated . the two main characters ( including the candyman ) deliver some great acting . i 'll admit the other characters are a bit weak , but that 's made up for by the zombies being incredible . this movie really shows ( by driving the point home a few times ) how humans do n't know how to treat each other . it 's not just a horror movie . it actually has a point to it and makes a humanitarian statement . rent it , buy it , whatever . but check it out . it 's a great movie
