chinese hitchcock `` koma '' is a surprisingly suspenseful film . while there is enough gore to certainly warrant horror flick categorization , director chi-leung law delivers a very old school hitchcock suspense tale . close-ups on objects like a foot dragging across the floor leaving a bloodstained trail heighten the suspense and move the story . angelica lee as fung chi-ching , a girl who needs a new kidney and has inhibitions that keep her from fully embracing her boyfriend , does a good job and hits many levels from hysteria to jealousy to drunken delirium . andy hui who plays her boyfriend , dr. tsui wai-man , hits a number of levels also from the guy in love to the man whose hormones outpace his common sense . as researcher suen ling , karena lam projects a person who has had a difficult upbringing and as frequently as not walks on the shady side of the street . the twists of plot that trace a kidney thief who black-markets organs for $ 60,000 a pop never leaves you quite settled until the final frame . subtitled with chinese dialog the often sparsely verbal picture translates well to an international audience . `` koma '' turns out to be a pleasant , often intelligent , surprise . enjoy !
