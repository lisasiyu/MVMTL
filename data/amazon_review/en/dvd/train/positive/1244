why isnt there a new live dvd ? i have this dvd and it 's a great deal . you get a brief on the road documentary of avril on her first tour ; you also get a complete performance from one of her concerts featuring all the songs on the first album ( and then some ) . it 's obvious to anyone objective that avril 's singing was n't very good when she first came out . however , i recently caught a performance of her from mad tv , singing my favorite song from her second cd . i have to say it was incredible . it 's obvious that she has put the time in to her craft and is turning into a phenomenal artist . given how phenomenal she is now , i dont understand why her record company hasnt released a new dvd ...
