every republican should see this film this is an interesting allegorical tale . david hemmings , in one of his best roles , represents the instinctual nature of the ordinary man with no greater aspirations other than to enjoy the pleasures of life . as political and military figures `` wave the flag '' to the beat of their own political persuasions , loyalty unto death to those political persuasions is the only proof of loyalty to one 's country . men die in this film and it is not all for queen and country .
