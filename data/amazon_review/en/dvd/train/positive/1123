funny movie ... just a bit harsh in some ways . i really like the red sox trivia and memorabilia found in this movie . it was so fun to see so many of my favorite red sox memories on a movie screen . i thought that jimmy fallon and drew barrymore did a great job . there was a great chemistry bewteen them . that is to say ... i was convinced that they were in love . the ending of the movie was great . i liked the drama of watching lindsay run across fenway park just to get back together with ben before he sells his tickets . i think the best word to use when describing this movie is `` cute . '' however , i 'm just tired of watching movies that make men look like idiots . clearly , the main focus of this film is the stupidity of men and how they need women to teach them how to act appropriatly . i mean , in many ways , ben is no more mature than an eight year old . that is an extreme and unfair portrayal of male baseball fans in my opinion .
