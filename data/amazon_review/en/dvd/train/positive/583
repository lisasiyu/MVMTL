terrific drumming video i give this dvd an enthusiastic 5 stars . if you 're into rush at all , or a serious drummer , this is a must have . it focuses mainly on the art of solo-ing , something mr peart does well at , but there 's enough material on the 2 discs to keep anyone fan or drummer interested . well worth the money .
