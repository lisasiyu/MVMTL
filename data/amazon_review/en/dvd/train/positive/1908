awesome dvd ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i wo n't wax rhapsodically about ritchie vs steve , but instead i will just rate the dang dvd . the musical direction is great . this compilation of tracks recorded at historic montreux in '96 and '00 is just fantastic . the sound quality is better than most systems are capable of , so you 'll probably get the best sound your equipment can give . i own purples australia '99 as well as scandinavian nights , new live and rare , and the come hell or high water reunion tour with blackmore . montreux is in the top two , and i have enjoyed it almost every night since it arrived last month . paice , morse , lord , glover and gillan mesh perfectly [ as always ] and obviously have a great time playing together . they joke around occasionally , and theres a few surprizes that spontaneously erupt on stage [ sooo , thats 'funky claude ' eh ? hmmm ] . this dp line-up clicks extremely well together , and it shows [ i ca n't believe i am the only one that noticed gillan giving blackmore the `` finger '' at the end of 'paint it black ' on the high water dvd . if you got it - watch the last second of that track .. boing ! up goes the 'bird ' at ritchie , who should have gotten a butt kickin instead of just the finger ] . if you are a purple fan , or just a music lover who enjoys those nice long live instrumental riffs of great rock & roll that highlight not only the guitarist but all facets of the bands talents , buy this disk . these guys blend better than tequila and lime . theres plenty of deep-cut material on it i 'd bet money you have not heard before and that in itself is reason enough
