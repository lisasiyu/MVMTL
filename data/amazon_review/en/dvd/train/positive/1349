flyboys i enjoyed this dvd and the suplemental dvd as well . i give this film four stars because of the great computer graphics and the clean plot . the reality factor was taken a little too far concerning the aircraft abilities/ capabilities of that time era . still ... the film was enjoyable . i ca n't help but wish that they developed the characters more . i guess there are time restraints and such to consider . anyway , a fun movie to relax with and eat pop corn with your family ! sure beats watching yet another ho hum flesh eatting zombie spin off that seems to always be showing up ( smile )
