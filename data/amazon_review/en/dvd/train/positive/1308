extremely satisfied to put it simply , if you 're a star trek fan you 'll like this season . if you 're not , you 'll probably find that some of the episodes are weak on plot or character interaction . however , there are some gems hidden among the these episodes . the klingon sub-plot gets its starting point here and the season finale is legendary in nextgen canon . season 3 really begins to reveal what nextgen was really all about . all in all much better than seasons 1 and 2
