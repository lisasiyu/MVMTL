an unexpected surprise the main theme of this film is well known and very well worked out . two enemies meet in a neutral surrounding . they want to kill each other , but by one reason or another , they do n't . sounds familiar ? well here we have an extra twist - a woman . none of these three people understand each other ; they speak different languages and they have different backgrounds . there is no understanding but yet there is some . they feel each other . the film is smartly complemented by the excellent director 's work , superb acting , top cinematography , and the beautiful scenery of ( laplandia - korelia ) the northern russia - southern finland . this was the territory the soviets aggressively took away from the finns in 1939 in the soviet - finish war ( the forgotten war ) . that is when the finish snipers and the brutal winter destroyed the soviet army but still a little country as finland could not defend itself against the soviet might . i give this film five stars and a very warm recommendation to everyone to watch it .
