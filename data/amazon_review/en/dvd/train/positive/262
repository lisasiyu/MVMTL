adam sandler shows surprising depth punch drunk love gave adam sandler a chance to show that he can play a serious role . there are plenty of laughs in this picture but one can never laugh at the main character . he is faced with what appear to be insurmountable odds , and he is a `` nice guy . '' therefore , the audience is hoping that somehow things will work out for him , but it is very uncertain what will happen ! this picture is a bit dark , so be aware that you may find yourself shocked at times , but hang on to the end . it 's worth it !
