top notch performance i saw denver in concert in ireland in april '97.i saw him a couple of times before that in the '90 's . it was the last time i would see him in concert sadly . he played solo . it was amazing . i went out and bought this the very next week . denver is in top form both musicially and vocally , as is his band . there are also some interesting monologues peppered throughout the concert where denver shares his concerns about the environment and wildlife preservation . a great performance all round . rca /sony : if good quality sound and vision footage exists of 1970 's ( i 'm sure it does ! ) denver concerts , please release it for the fans now
