classic filming at its best , better in 3d i 've always been a fan of this film , though it was n't until recently that i got to see it all the way through to the end . in 2d , `` creature ... '' is good , but only that . since this film was intended to be seen in true 3d form , and that does n't mean in the crappy red & blue anaglyph glasses version , that really is the best way to see it . gladly , the field sequential 3d edition is available from two web sites and it is fantastic . the stereo depth really makes the movie better than ever . plus , all the dimensional sight gags work instead of just making you wonder why they were filmed that way . being able to experience the stereo depth of the beautiful underwater photography , even in black & white , leaves you wanting more in the end . i highly recommend `` creature from the black lagoon '' , but only in 3d using the shutter glasses system found in the `` ultimate 3d collection '' from amazon.com ( buy it cheap from a used & new seller )
