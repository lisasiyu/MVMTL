i liked it ... ... ... .. kris and her father get into a car accident and she ends up loosing her father . kris and her friends go to belgium to clean out her fathers study where he had been working on his latest manuscript . while there the caretakes talks them into taking a tour of the mine . while in the mine the group learns the story of andries martines who was a murderer and also into black magic . however as it turns out andries spirit was not laid to rest . i do n't want to give away too much of it but i really enjoyed it . very well done all around and creepy which is a big plus considering some the stinkers i have seen lately
