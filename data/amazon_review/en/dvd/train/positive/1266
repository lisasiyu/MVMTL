a good introduction to stability ball swiss ball basics is a 50 minute workout , there is only 10 exercises which are performed in 2 sets of about 10 reps , the instructor shows more advanced variations on the second set and does some stretches in between the sets . though the exercises can be challenging , the workout is pretty slow paced and let you to concentrate in the exercises . the quality of this video is very good and it is filmed on a sanded area , the instruction is very good also and during the exercises there 's some animated pointers . i think if youre in a good shape you 'd be better off just buying his `` swiss ball abs '' it has most of the exercises from swiss ball basics but it has 3x20 minute workouts in different levels ( but there all pretty tough ) .
