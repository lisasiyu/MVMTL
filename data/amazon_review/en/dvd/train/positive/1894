i loved it ! ! ! ! ! i bought this recently , when i was about to watch it i thought it was going to be the stupidest thing i have ever seen . but after the first few minutes i loved it . the special effects were good ( for 1914 ) the only thing i didnt like is the weird music and the naration . whats wrong with panio or organ music
