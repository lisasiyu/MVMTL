love is all i have just finished watching lorenzo 's oil for the first time and i have never seen acting like this . susan sarandon and nicke nolte should have won oscars for their performances . it is the most intense , inspiring movie you could ever hope to come across . the epitome of what love between father , mother and child can encompass . do yourself a favor and watch this movie .
