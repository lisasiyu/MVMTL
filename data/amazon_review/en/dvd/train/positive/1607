a great gospel film i heard about this version of the life of christ , but had never seen it . it is a striking black and white telling of the gospel of matthew . it is beautifully filmed ( there are a few problems with subtitles , but you can follow the story just fine ) movie , and very true to matthew 's gospel . as a pastor and a christian , i highly recommend this moving video
