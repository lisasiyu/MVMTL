inspirational masterpiece flawless movie making at its best ! patriotic and powerful telling of the true beginning-of-the-end for the confederacy . ex-slaves and free blacks alike , finally allowed to defend their dignity , were the final blow to the southern bondage of an entire race of human beings history tells us . the truth based story of the massachusetts 54th . only the beginning of black heroics during the civil war . from the dignified talent of morgan freeman , to denzel washington 's academy award winning performance as a militant loud mouth runaway , great acting to suit everything else about this film . and another level of respect achieved for matthew broderick indeed . so many standout scenes , but most memorable , denzel 's beating . back already scarred from his cruelly treated past , he takes his punishment in total silence . only allowing a single tear to fall during a cinematic closeup . heartbreaking . the highest rating possible .
