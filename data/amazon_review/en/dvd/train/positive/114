unique and entertaining , the first thing you will notice with this one is the strange animation . it 's hard to even describe really ... but expect some disoriented backgrounds with some cgi thrown in . the plot however , is excellent . the main focus is about a author is going around collecting ghost stories . he constantly runs into a trio of outlawish justice seekers . they do what is called `` committing '' someone for their sins . these first 4 episodes deal with single episode told stories but all are great . this anime is highly reccomended for the horror fans out there
