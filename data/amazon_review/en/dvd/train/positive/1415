silence on every playground this is an intelligent sci-fi thriller that does n't disappoint . it 's a bleak and distubing look at the world , two decades from now . chaos has erupted everywhere as people are overcome by an overwhelming hopelessness . this fear is generated due to the fact that no child has been born for eighteen years . it 's a countdown to extinction . theo ( clive owen ) is asked to deliver a young pregnant girl out of the tumultuous country . to the casual viewer this may not seem like much of a task , unless you can really submerse yourself in the context of the volatile situation . i totally got caught up in the effort , completely absorbed by the significance of this mission . the action really kept me on edge . i was expecting the movie to get too preachy with apocalyptic themes , you know -- hell , fire and brimstone . any religous fanatics would definitely have some valid points . this is touched on periodically , but does n't go too over the top . i also liked the sarcasm evident when some idiot spray painted a sign that read `` last one to die , please turn out the lights '' . there 's always got ta be a prankster . overall , i thought this was a great movie -- action-packed , original , and insightful
