`` turn the sun down '' : teen summer fun cartoon with daria . i saw the preview of this cartoon on netflix . seeing the teen characters dancing and having fun on the beach ( minus daria , who sits by herself reading a newspaper - with interruptions ) , i knew i had to buy this . and i love it ! `` is it fall yet ? '' deals with the main characters ' experiences during summer vacation . the highlight : `` the tom thing '' -as trent lane , jane 's musician brother , nicely puts it . daria and tom have fallen in love , and are dating . tom and jane have broken up . this situation dents the friendship of daria and jane . the two bonus episodes on the dvd ( `` fire '' and `` dye ! dye , my darling ! '' ) show how `` the tom thing '' happened . it 's recommended to watch those two bonus episodes first as they lead up to the emotional turmoil and love triangle of daria , jane and tom that is carried over into the movie . adding to daria 's anguish , her mother enrolls her to be a camp counselor at the `ok-to-cry corral ' summer camp . working with her are her teachers , dorky mr. o'neill and anthony demartino ( with his trademark bloodshot eyeball that widens when he 's very irritated ) . the other `daria ' characters have their own situations . lovelorn jane goes to a bohemian artist retreat that 's out of lawndale . dim-witted lovers kevin and brittany provide comic relief as they both work as lifeguards at a local pool . they only have eyes for each other ... and i wo n't go further than that . watch the movie , and see for yourselves ! daria 's spoiled brat sister quinn and her `fashion club ' gal pals get tutored due to low scores on their psat exams . ( how i remember my high school days ! i was a junior when i took my psat exam - and passed it ! ) lead `fashion club ' member sandi ( with the deep voice ) reminds me so much of khan from mike judge 's `` king of the hill '' series . like khan , sandi is often sullen-expressioned , and complains a lot ! mack and jodie also have their share of the `summertime blues ' . mack takes a job as an ice-cream vendor , in a truck , and has to put up with bratty kids who aggravate him as they buy ice cream . his girlfriend jodie has her share of difficulties as she volunteers at an office , and is up to her neck in work . the pair does n't have time to date . i love the opening 'beach ' number with the `daria ' cast frolicking on the beach ... and with daria not participating , of course . it is reminiscent of the `` beach blanket '' 1960 's movies with frankie avalon and annette funicello . jane , too , is seen isolated on another part of the beach , painting . her isolation gives proof of her rift with daria . the song `` turn the sun down '' , sung by the female band splendora ( who provide the theme song for `daria ' ) , is playfully catchy ! splendora sounds like the female version of the beach boys . the 'beach ' segment concludes with the sun going down at the beach at dusk , with the frolickers still dancing ... followed , in a dissolve , by the `` daria '' logo in a similar 'dusk ' color , with the film 's title ; and splendora 's melodic singing as the song concludes . this is a nice effect . another nice effect is in the dvd 's main menu , with a scene taken from the opening of the `daria ' t.v . series . a somber daria is at the movies . her fellow moviegoers , surrounding her , are laughing at the scenes from the opening `beach ' segment . `` turn the sun down '' is played in the background . at the film 's end , there are `outtakes ' , which are cute and amusing involving the `daria ' cast . there are a few gross outtakes also included . `` is it fall yet ? '' got me interested in the `` daria '' t.v . series . to admit , daria looks much nicer in her own series than when she was on beavis and butt-head '' . i purchased her `` daria diaries '' and `` daria databases '' books to help me get to know the lawndale characters . i 'm presently reading her `diaries ' . and i , too , hope that the complete `` daria '' series gets released on dvd in the very near future . but treat yourself to the interesting summer experiences -- as well as the summer fun -- at lawndale with `` is it fall yet ? '' and savor daria 's sweet smile at the near-conclusion of the opening sequence in the two bonus episodes . a little girl in the film asks camp counselor daria `` do you ever smile ? ? '' the answer is yes ! and this movie is sure to make you smile . it 's a gem in the `` daria '' series !
