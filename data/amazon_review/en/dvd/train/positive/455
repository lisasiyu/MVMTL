the house of eliott i thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1 , 2 and 3 of the house of eliott . the acting was fantastic , the dresses magnificent and the locations , as with most english mini-series , marvelous . my only complaint is that it does n't end ! ! there is no closure to this . as you approach the last chapter of season 3 you start to wonder how they are going to wrap it all up in the little time that is left , and - oh surprise ! - things are left unsettled and you feel that you need one more season to see how things worked out for everyone ! is there any chance that there is a season 4 out there somewhere ? ? ? ?
