a lot of loose ends ... up until today , i would have given this wonderful movie , which we watched in my spanish class , 5+ stars . but i did not at all like the ending ; it very much ruined it for me . i 'm a person who needs closure . yes , this was a movie demonstrating a tragic topic and should be sad . but that was just cruel , to end with the poor little girl singing about how she 's so lost . we do n't know her fate . i also felt that roberto was a sort of villainized character . he had a point about gaby having to lose another mother . i hope that alicia , when she left , was going to get gaby . what i would like to know is what they decided to do with sara , her possible grandmother . again , i need closure ! i was expecting a depressing ending , but not to be left hanging like this ! arghhhhh . i also had a problem with gaby 's having been born in captivity . it makes that scene where the little boys suddenly burst into her room kind of pointless ; it 's meaningful , powerful , and was one of my favorite scenes until i realized she was just startled . i guess it still has meaning , but , i dunno . just my being nitpicky , i guess . i also want to know who pedro was . also , what gaby 's possible parents did that got them arrested . i realize that it could have been something very minor , but it would be nice to know . for all i know they all could have been gun-toting revolutionaries . overall though , it was a wonderful movie and i am considering buying it myself . i especially loved the scenes involving las madres y abuelas de la playa de mayo . and the acting was fantastic . i just am bothered by all of these questions that are never answered
