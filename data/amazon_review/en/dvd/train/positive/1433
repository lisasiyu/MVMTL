`` rashomon '' with music and beauties , energized by kay kendall as several other reviewers have commented , this film , gene kelly 's last musical with mgm , borrows its central conceit from akira kurosawa 's immortal `` rashomon '' - only this time , the central event is n't a murder , but a tangled love affair involving a song-and-dance man ( kelly ) and his three gorgeous backups ( kendall , mitzi gaynor and taina elg ) which becomes the subject of a media-magnet london lawsuit . the lovely , much-lamented kendall 's performance is the core of this movie ( her drunken-opera scene is not to be missed ! ) but elg , gaynor and kelly all turn in highly creditable work as well .
