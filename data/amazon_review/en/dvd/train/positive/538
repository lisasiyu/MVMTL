trey parker and the gang now show exactly why south park is n't a kids show . this movie shows that south park was never intended to be a kid 's show . when the show was seen through the human eye it was also then known that it was n't concidered a kid 's show . this movie is outrageous and shows the hilarious side of vulgar language . any south park fan who is offended by vulgar language is used to the show being cencored on tv . this movie is not for the easilly offended . especially for people easily offended to the f word . this movie is hilarious and extremely outrageous . on comedy central they got away with airing it on tv only by showing it uncencored . great film for the south park fan and the ones not offended buy vulgar language
