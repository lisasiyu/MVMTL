finally , a worthy dvd edition ! clueless has been released on dvd before , with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features . in 2005 , for its 10th anniversary , paramount finally released a great , if not cheesily named , dvd edition of this 90 's teen comedy classic , with such quotable lines as `` you 're a virgin who ca n't drive '' and `` as if ! '' the transfer on this dvd is awesome . it 's very clean , sharp , and clear . i do n't remember any issues on the past dvd , but if there were any , it seems like they were cleared up for this release . the bonus features are likeable fluff , but at least they 're existent . featuring new interviews with several cast and crew members , such featurettes as `` the class of '95 , '' which discusses the cast , and `` language arts , '' which discusses the many phrases that this movie brought to our pop culture lexicon , allow us to delve , if only just slightly , into the making and the impact of this movie . also , the trailers from the previous dvd release are included . children of the 90 's definitely need to own this dvd . clueless is still a major part of america 's pop culture today , and really , who does n't love watching a 90 's teen comedy remake of a literary classic like jane austen 's emma
