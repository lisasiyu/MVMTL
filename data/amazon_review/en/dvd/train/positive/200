very nice romantic drama . i origionaly did n't want to watch this film i mean come on a film starring sandra bullock but it was my girlfriend who suggested that i watch this film and said that i might like it and now i admit it was pretty good . sandra bullock plays a woman named birdee pruitt who believes to be happy with a perfect life until she appears on national television and hears her best friend confessing to an affair with her husband . she then leaves her married home and travels to her birth place in texas where she begins to rebuild her life and relationships especialy with her mother and young daughter who hates birdee . i was surprised that the film did n't have any cliche hollywood moments and it dealt with human emotions and was realistic , birdee has to overcome the humiliation and public betrayal she obviously has a lot of problems but soon harry connick jr. 's character comes along to hopefully win birdee 's heart since they knew each other from highschool . the film was very uplifting and in a way it is a serious romantic drama with a bit of humor so i enjoyed this film alot and i did n't hesitate the fact that i like sandy in these roles and everybody else gave a great performance and i hope that she stars in more films like this instead of those awful comedies , i highly recomend this film
