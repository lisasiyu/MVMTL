lacked some heart this was a good action flick but i felt that there was nobody encouraging eachother on the swat team or anybody doing anything or saying anything with heart . the film was one of the best action films out there though and i did like the scene where the young swat memebers are training to be on the team . the end of the movie is pretty cool and samuel l. jackson played a great leader for the swat team just like he was a great coach on coach carter . when guns or bombs go off the sourround sound is exhilirating . the commentary was dissapointing though . buy it if you like action flicks . god bless you and america
