it will pull your heartstrings ! when this movie showed up on a movie channel , i almost skipped it , but i am so glad that i did n't ! i enjoyed the characters so much , including the insane little seeing eye b*tch ! there were so many feelings involved . the film was funny , a little crazy , touching , sad , and very , very moving . i loved getting to know the russian or ukrainian people and their culture ; the old as well as the new . alex is so charming and funny at the same time , with his ideas of hip hop and the american culture ; and wisdom that seems beyond his years . elijah wood was wonderful as the eccentric little american jew named jonathan who seemed very meek and a little bumbling ( he had a phobia of dogs and almost could n't get into the car with one ) , but he was amazingly brave to go on his quest in a country he knew nothing about to find the woman who helped his grandfather escape from the nazis in wwii . alex 's grandfather , who insisted that he was blind , yet he drove the tour car that they all rode in , was such a character ; a combination of harsh from the years of hardship he 'd had in his life , and yet with a soft tender side underneath that showed up every once in a while . the russian songs throughout the movie were perfect and pulled you right into the story . the scenery was amazing . it all made me want to visit ukraine . if you have n't watched this movie , do it !
