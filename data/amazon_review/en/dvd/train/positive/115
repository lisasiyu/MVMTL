screw u guys im going home hilarious i think south parkis like the best show in the world so is family guy but u cant beat s park with anything . 1 sad thing is that kenny does not die in seasons after 5 and in 6 my favorite character kenny what sadly only in the last episode of the season i own seasons 1-8 i know 8 didnt come out yet but at a place called cd island they have dvds before they come out . i think that the best episode of this show ever was on season 9 and the episode was about the kids playing baseball but they really hated it and they kept winning episode was hilarious . i think anybody who likes south park must get season 8 you must .also the episode when the boys play with weapons is also a favorite so if you like south park comedy buy season 8 p.s . if youreally like south park buy seasons 1-7 witch r also hilarous
