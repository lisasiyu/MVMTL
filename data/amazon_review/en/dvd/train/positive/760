the best trilogy ever ! ! ! x-men , x-men united and x-men `` the last stand '' are simply spectacular ! the cast , the characters , the special effects , the story , the action scenes , and everyhting else seems to work to make these movies the best movie trilogy ever ! ! ! .i have seen lots of movies in my life , but nothing compares and comes close to x-men .
