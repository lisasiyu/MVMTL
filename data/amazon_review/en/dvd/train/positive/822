top ten food movie i spent two weeks cruising the italian neighborhoods of san francisco looking for a restaurant like the one portrayed so richly in this movie . and i found one ! unfortunately , as might have been predicted from the film , it lasted only a few months before folding . there 's more to big night than the food . it 's outrageously funny , for one thing , a quality many reviewers seemed not to appreciate . the acting is brilliant ; for once , everyone acts in ensemble . it 's original , not quite any hollywood genre . it 's poignant , in emotional terms most people can find believable . is it a great movie ? dumb question ! it 's a movie you 'll enjoy and remember
