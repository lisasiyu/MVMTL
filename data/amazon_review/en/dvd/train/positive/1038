not a bad first experience having moved overseas when my son was 8 months old , i have been pretty oblivious to what blue 's clues was . now that he 's 18 months , i ordered this dvd to help him learn about shapes and colors . it 's not a bad introduction to the world of blue 's clues . i remember baby sitting children during the hey-days of barney and i found blue 's clues much more palatable . as for my son , he loves it and bops around to the songs and watches the guy as he names the shapes . it does keep his interest so definitely a winner
