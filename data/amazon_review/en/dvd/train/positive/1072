loved my big fat greek wedding this movie pictured a sizable segment of the u.s. population that has not gotten much attention in the movies - the high involvement mediterranean family . many italians i know said that it could have been their family . the movie works so well because the author and star really lived and knew the life she depicted . i enjoyed the wry humor . at the beginning i was prepared to hate her father . he was so sexist and bullying and anti-intellectual . and the women of the family were so cynically manipulative . it did not occur to me until late into the movie that the father was really afraid . he had only the best in mind for his family , and that included his daughters , and that he too felt out of his element in a different mix of cultures that is the united states . one other detail pleased me ; the role of the community college in helping people break free from a confining life to move up in the world . not only do they learn academic things , they meet wonderful people from other cultures there , fall in love , and marry them . the photography was wonderful and the acting was superb , especially since the movie was made on a tight budget . this is one of the best films i have seen in the past ten years .
