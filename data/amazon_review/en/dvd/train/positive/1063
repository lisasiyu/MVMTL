requires active viewing participation this is a singular masterpiece in film making but totally unlike anything , even for it 's day . by today 's attention deficit disorder standards , this film is really really odd . but no doubt it is a masterpiece if the viewer is willing to put the effort in to catch all the nuances because this is a film of nothing but nuances . tati himself is just one of many participants . there is a plot of sorts dealing with a group of female american tourists and the one women who is the odd duck among them . she meets tati and they spend the night together dancing at a night club and see in the dawn at a coffee shop . various bits of business are constantly swirling around them and you could view this picture 10 times before seeing everything . there are many jokes but they are gentle visual puns . do n't expect belly laughs , just a wry but amazing view on modern life . as is standard practice for criterian these days the extras on disc two are spectacular . the documentaries on tati 's life and this film are brilliant and helped me understand his art and this film much better . a gentle film with brilliant use of wide screen ( this film would make no sense pan and scan ) you need to fall into the picture to enjoy it . but there is an endless wealth of material to enjoy
