highly recommended eye candy this dvd showcases some of the best visual artist talent in the vj and nightlife industry today all mixed to some killer trance music . all of the visuals are stunning except i am not a big fan of the contributions made by bionic dots . they seem to be overly paranoid about showcasing their work so they obnoxiously brand their content with annoying info bars across the bottom of the screen . the video content is great as is for playing at parties or can be utilized as source material by any interested vj in mnay creative ways . this dvd is well worth a purchase for anyone that has been mesmerized by video screens at a top nightclub or underground party - highly recommended eye candy
