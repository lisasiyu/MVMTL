real friendship this movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices . he hit the time , the place and the kids perfectly . this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share , i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me ... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world . i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday . its a great movie and i 'd recommend it to anyone . you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about ... . growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which is n't as bad as it sounds . plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell . its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950 's over this era .
