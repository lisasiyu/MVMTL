if i could give it 10 stars this may not be my favorite movie ever , but if its not then my favorite is no better . this film is beautiful , not only in its comedy but in its truthful tone hidden beneath the slight absurdity . i really ca n't say anything other than if you like wes anderson films , or anything even loosly associated with it then go now and watch it twice
