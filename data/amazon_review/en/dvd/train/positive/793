best show ever hilarious . simply hilarious . this show is genius , one of the smartest and funniest comedies ever . i am shocked it was cancelled after 3 seasons and amazed that it is not more widely accepted as quite possibly the best show on television . anyone with a good sense of humor that loves ridiculous situations and randomness would love these dvd 's . i only hope that comedy central releases seasons 2 and 3 . there is a petition , everyone who 's interested should sign , just google it
