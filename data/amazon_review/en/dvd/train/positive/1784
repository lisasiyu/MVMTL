good melodrama , fine leading performance , handsome production for all the care they put into this fine , textured story of a pedophilia scandal in a catholic orphanage in 1970s newfoundland , the filmmakers ca n't let go of the conventional dichotomy of child abuse dramas : grim , teeth-gnashing villains and righteous , just-folks heroes . it 's as though the subject is so touchy it can only be approached through melodrama . henry czerny , though , gives a courageously unsympathetic performance that lends realistic but unexpected dimensions to teeth-gnashing , and lise roy is superb as his wife in the film 's second part . and the canadians go further than american filmmakers ever could or would , suggesting how available the boys ' bodies are , and what could be attractive about them . finally , the whole snowbound , wood-paneled production is goregous to look at . subject matter aside , if you doubt that canada is a distinct place from the united states , take in the sights , sounds , and attitudes of this small epic
