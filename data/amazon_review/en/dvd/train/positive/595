the baby-size dvd for weddings i have to qualify this review in that i viewed this dvd that a friend had purchased for themselves ; they wanted something that was n't immensely detailed , and they felt it was a good reference tool for their needs . i had purchased martha 's `` complete weddings '' dvd , so it was an interesting comparison of the two . if you are looking for a brief overview of wedding planning , then this would be a very well-done general reference guide . it will give you an overview of wedding day idea 's and will be most helpful . you get a little bit of flowers , dresses , cakes , atmosphere , etc . so this is an informative , but basic , tool to help you in your plans . the quality of film , sound , and color is superb , as always . she gives her lessons slow enough to take notes , but still with enough information that you feel you have a good hold of the subject . this is a wonderful choice for the basics of wedding planning , or even for a fancy party . congratulations on one of the happiest days of your lives ! !
