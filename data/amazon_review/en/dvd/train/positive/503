n.y. dolls 101 ... this is amazing ! the holy grail for any dolls fan.if you like the dolls this is a no brainer ... buy it now ! professionally done , amazing footage , great bonus material.one of the coolest things i 've ever bought or watched.watch history in the making. & what a great band.even though they are lumped in with punk or glam , i always thought they were a true rock & roll band in the purest form.the next step in rock 's evolution after the stones , yardbirds , & pretty things.i ca n't reccomend this enough .
