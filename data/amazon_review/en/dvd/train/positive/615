`` the ratio of people to cake is too big ... .. '' ... says the mumbling milton ( my favorite character ) . the characters and their odd mannerisms made this film a success , in my view . one of my coworkers lent me this movie , promising me that i 'd like it - he was right . it is both funny and tragic , though a bit exaggerated ( but it 's a movie , where life circumstances do not have to be totally realistic ) . most people can relate to office space , even if they do n't have a cubicle-based job . i happen to have a cubicle-based job , though i recently moved from a rather large cubicle to an office , which i share with another coworker ( there is a gray cubicle wall dividing it ) . it 's not so bad though . anyway , the main character , peter gibbons , lacks motivation in his career and is fed up with a number of business practices . but he does n't quit his job - he just stops working . doing nothing is his ideal life . the rap music is a nice touch . now back to my favorite character , milton , who repeatedly says that he `` could set the building on fire '' whenever things get too rough . he is pathetic yet likeable , and i felt sorry for him when he did n't get any cake at the party . everyone keeps passing it around , and he watches the cake get smaller and smaller until it is completely gone . and his desk is moved numerous times , which really irritates him . eventually , he moves down to the basement , where it is dark and lonely . his boss comes down to ask him to kill the cockroaches ( `` that would be terrific '' ) , even though it 's not milton 's job . his distinctive `` excuse me ... '' protests are rarely heard . he is being used by the company , no one respects him , no one listens to him . i 'd burn the building down too
