just ok i guess i am jaded because i watched the imax everest video ( which seems to get the best reviews ) first and ca n't help but compare them . still this video had some good participants i.e . ed viestur 's and such . interesting view point but the testing did n't do much for me but provide information . would have liked more extra 's on dvd to . all in all ok .
