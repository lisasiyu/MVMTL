an action flick with philosophical undertones i just finished watching i , robot on hbo . i ca n't vouch for the quality of the picture or sound of this particular dvd , just the storyline . i really enjoyed it . a lot of action , but there is ( obviously ) a philosophical undertone to the whole film . purists will probably dislike that the philosophy ( and much of the original story ) of isaac asimov 's book takes a backseat to the action . during some scenes , i was thinking : wow , they definitely made a video game about this movie . much of the latter half of the movie is mind-numbing special effects/action , though , contrary to another viewer 's opinion , i did n't find the climax `` stupid . '' i found it complimented the philosophical aspects of the film , though it probably could have been developed more fully with a little more dialogue and a little less action . parts of the movie actually reminded me of arguments put forward by peter singer , the radical secularist/ professor at princeton university who advocates infanticide for disabled children . specifically , this conversation from the film sticks in my mind : `` you are making a mistake . do you not see the logic of my plan ? '' to which the reply comes : `` yes . but it just seems too ... heartless . '' essentially , the robots used absolutely no heart in the decision making process ; just cold , detached logic , which sometimes sounds great on paper , but is much less appealing in the real world . in sum , a lot of action , though the philosophical aspect is still very much present ( man vs. creator , creator vs. man , the soul , purpose in life , free will , natural law , conscience and consciousness etc ) once you reflect on the film . mostly action entertainment , but also thought provoking on further review
