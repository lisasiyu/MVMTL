the mime , the actor , the criminal , the aristocrat , and their love `` children of paradise '' is set in pre 1840 paris , on boulevard of crime and is a richly entertaining and intensely romantic . it is the story of infatuation , jealousy , deception , grief , murder , and true love lost forever . the film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named garance ( unforgettably played by arletty who was over 40 and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age ) and four men who love her - the famous mime baptist ( jean-louis barrault is matchless ) , the actor , frederick lemaitre , the criminal pierre-fran√ßois lacenaire , and the aristocrat comte de montray . she loved one of them and the affair was doomed . the film is so much more than just a romantic story ( which is absolutely beautiful and compelling ) - it is a love song to the art of theater where art imitates life and vice-versa and the hidden symbolism of freedom and despotism ( the film was made in paris during the nazi occupation under immensely difficult circumstances ) . jacques prevert wrote the brilliant and ironic scenario and dialog ; marcel carne superbly directed the film . its larger than life and gloriously three-dimensional characters , narrative skill and the sweep of production make it a true cinema triumph . it is a 190 minutes long film but i cherished every minute of it .
