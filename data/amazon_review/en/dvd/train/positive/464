great movie but much is fiction ... .. i am a math teacher myself so i have always had a special interest in this film . i think it is very well done and it is very inspirational . however , for anyone who wants to know the true story of what happened with escalante and his students , purchase the book `` escalante : the best teacher in america '' by jay mathews . the film leads you to believe that escalante took students who did n't know how to multiply and then in the course of one school year made those same students score 5s on the ap calculus test . this is far from what really happened . escalante spent years developing a program and he made sure he had proper courses that led to an understanding of calculus . there is one other noticeable bit of fiction in the film . the movie portrays it as the testing company ( ets ) accused the students of cheating simply because the company was racist and they felt the students at garfield high school could n't have possibly known the material . the true story is that some answers on the ap tests from garfield were noticeably similar . about 12 students made the same exact errors on one particular problem , and that is what made ets suspicious . so once again , a well done film , and while is it `` based on a true story '' , it is far from a true story
