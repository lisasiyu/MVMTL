fun to watch ! lighten up , fellow reviewers ! anger management is lighthearted comedy -- not neurosurgery . i had zero expectations going into this movie , but as soon as the hilarious plane scene unfolded i found myself watching with an ear-to-ear grin on my mug . i 've seen adam sandler in numerous movies ( and hated most of them ) , but as humble , wishy-washy dave buznik , sandler is at his low-key best . buznik is the last person to have an anger management problem , but following a fateful series of miscues ( and hysterically funny miscues at that ) he is ordered by a judge to attend an anger management course . and this is not just any old course : this is a course led by the unorthodox and dysfunctional dr . buddy rydell ( jack nicholson 's inherent creepiness is perfect for this role ) . nicholson and sandler play off one another in grand fashion ; the goofy therapist pushing the mild-mannered buznik to the edge -- and beyond -- is mucho fun to watch ! an added delight to this campy comedy is the plethora of camoes , including john c. reilly , woody harrelson ( also hysterically funny ) , rudy giuliani , and new york yankee greats ( and ex-greats ) derek jeter and roger clemens . anger management is pure fun , complete with milquetoast ending and wacky nicholson facial expressions . enjoy ! -- d. mikels , author , the reckoning
