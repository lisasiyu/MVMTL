excellent , easy , energizing practices i love these practices ! they go so well with the longer yoga conditioning for weight loss . the a.m practice is my particular favorite , it really gets me going , i do it almost everyday , in addition to a longer practice later in the afternoon . if i 'm particulary rushed , i might repeat the a.m. practice , i like it so much . the p.m is pretty good , too ; i get to sleep quicker when i do it .
