good way to learn the footwork and turns of salsa dancing look , i am not a dancer . and i am a classical , not a salsa musician . however , i found the disk quite entertaining and helpful . gigi and pedro do not come across as so elegant and skilled that it seems impossible for the average person to copy . yes , both know what they are doing and are quite fluent in what they communicate . the instruction on the disk allows you to watch their whole demonstration from beginning to end or go through each set of steps and turns lesson by lesson . you also have three choices of camera angle . the default is from in front . you can also choose looking down from above , or from the back . this multi-view method allows you to see things in the dance that a simple 2d presentation from the front actually hides . the names of the steps are given in spanish , but even if you do n't speak the language you will pick up on the names quickly ; it is not hard . i did miss the discussion of how to communicate dance steps through hand motions that i have seen in another salsa series . one is n't going to call out the names of the steps as gigi and pedro do throughout these disks . it is the subtle way one moves the hands and touches the partner that communicate what is to be done next and that is as much a part of learning the dance as the footwork . still , a pretty darn good set of instructional disks
