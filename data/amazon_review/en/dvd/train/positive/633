beautiful film most likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone , but i wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is . i am a long time u2 fan and had seen rattle and hum , but did n't get around to purchasing the dvd until late 2005 . the fact that the music is wonderful is a given , but the cinematography is just astounding . i love how you get to see everything from every point of view . you get to see what the band sees on and around the stage , including the breathtaking sea of fans . you get to see what the fans see -- the spectacular lighting and silhouettes . you get to hear what the guys think and feel off-stage as well as on . and of course you get the passionate music . the film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to . i could n't ask for more
