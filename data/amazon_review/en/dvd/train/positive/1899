misunderstood minds i teach high school and this video did a few things for me . first , it showed me the importance of elementary school teachers in pin pointing learning disabilities . second , it is important for parents to explore different possibilities for why students are n't performing . i have an 8 yr old nephew who was just diagnosed with severe dislexia and the original prescription was drugs for add . explore the possibilities ! third , the specific story of the teenager drove home the importance of having smaller classes in high school . i have 35 kids in each class . i know that for some , that is small . i have 6 classes . it is impossible for teachers , most of us wish we could , to be able to cater to the needs of each individual student . the video showed the importance of not only giving a correct diagnosis for a students problems , but the importance of following through and working with the student , so he or she can really succeed . the real stories showed the emotion that not only the students go through , but the families as well . it is a firm reminder that children need understanding , not labels . i recommend misunderstood minds
