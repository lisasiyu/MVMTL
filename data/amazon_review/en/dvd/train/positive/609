very namaste i loved yoga shakti very much . there were 2 dvds and a booklet inside the case and the first dvd contained all 4 yoga workouts like basic flow , solar flow 1 , solar flow 2 and lunar flow . shiva rea performs all of these vinyasa flow practices alone on the gorgeous beaches of maldives'island and kerala , india.the extra archival footage included of indian festivals and practices in temples is also a nice surprise.this dvd is definitely worth every penny .
