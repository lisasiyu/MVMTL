not for beginners this is a cool video , just from the standpoint of watching jaco pastorius play , however it 's wrong to say that it is a bass instruction video . it 's just two bassists swapping ideas . there is no time spent demonstrating any kinds of technique or style , and the accompanying booklet is pretty useless , as it does n't suggest fingerings , or strings , which is ok for a tune , but pointless for an excercise . the only way you 'll learn from this is to go through it frame by frame and hope you 'll be able to figure out how he 's playing . also not so good from terms of performance , jaco 's not at his best here , and has put a fretted neck on his fretless for demonstartion , but it slows him down in the live jam . all in all , very cool to watch , but do n't expect to learn much , or hear much , kind of like watching a vh-1 interview or something of that ilk . snippets of tunes will get you fired up , but nothing is really explained
