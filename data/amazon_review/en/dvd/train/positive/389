evil dead is a gorehound delite ! it 's hard to imagine this was sam raimi 's first entry into films , considering his more tame offerings such as spider-man , which is a good movie by the way , even if it does n't feature any gore . are you looking for a bath of gory fun ? this is the movie that must be in your collection if you are a blood hound like myself . ash is at his weakest in this version of the series , but this is how he gets started . the cast is much different than that of evil dead 2 , and by far , this film is much gorier , as preferred . how gory ? how about spilling buckets of blood , bodily dismemberment and loads of gut chopping . wonderful horror film without any limitations on the gore . and i thought braindead was gory , ha
