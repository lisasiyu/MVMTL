jakie chan at his best 'the medallion ' captures all of the qualities fans of jakie chan know and love , action , supspense , extreme humor , and a touch of mystisism , all the qualities i know and loved in the kid 's wb ! 'jakie chan : adventures ' cartoon series . it has a great cast [ julian sands as the dreaded snakehead , claire forlani as the high kicking interpol agent nicole , lee evens as the bumbling agent watson , and , of course , jakie chan as the chinese super-man eddie yang ] that help give the movie a great energy . the greatest thing about it was it was n't afraid to make fun of itself ! great movie , i hope they make a sequel !
