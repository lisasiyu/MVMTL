fun family film this movie is one of my kids ' favorites . in fact , it was the first live-action movie my older daughter could sit through , probably because it 's pretty cartoonish live-action . the nice thing is that grownups can stand to watch it , too . it 's very silly , of course , but there are lots of funny gags , many of which go right over the heads of children . there 's a little bathroom humor , but what else would you expect in a movie with talking gorillas and an elephant that plays fetch ? best of all , from my point of view , is the fact that perfectly-cast brendan fraser spends a good portion of the movie wearing only a loincloth . i agree with other reviewers , however , that it would be nice if the dvd were in widescreen and came with some extras . but i 'll settle for 90 minutes of happy children plus brendan fraser in a loincloth
