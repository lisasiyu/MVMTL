one of the effects of cinematic media : reaction watching the 1998 the siege in 2007 and then rolling through all the reviews of this film from the time of release to the present is a lesson in the power of the cinema . the obvious initial response was less about the film as a film than about the manner in which the fbi , cia , military , terrorists , and public responded to the unimaginable : shouts of protests about 'glorification of occult terrorists ' , the hollywood idea of the impossible happening , and the criticism of the fine cast of actors who steeped into roles 'beyond swallowing ' are all here in these reviews . now , six years after 9/11 reviewers are taking a different view , though most still find the film pompous and obnoxious . offensive versus defensive . and after viewing the movie as a movie it is gratifying to know that people feel strongly and are vocal about the depiction of the 'war against terrorism ' we continue to lose . movies that make people think and talk are valuable , and in that light the film is more successful than initially considered . yes , there are gaping holes in the script and the plot and the concept , but as a little thriller it maintains our attention throughout and offers some fine moments from actors such as denzel washington , annette bening , tony shalhoub , bruce willis , sami bouajila , ahmed ben larby , aasif mandvi among others . and then there are the panoramas of new york city under siege with the twin towers standing mightily in the cityscape ... it begs the question : if scriptwriter lawrence wright and director edward zwick ( blood diamond , the last samurai , courage under fire , glory , leaving normal , legends of the fall , etc ) were thinking along these lines and finding flaws in our intelligence forces , why were n't the leaders in washington , dc in tune with 'absurd possibilities ' ? it makes one think - and that is the best thing about this film . grady harp , january 07
