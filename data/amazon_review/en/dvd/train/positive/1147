oscar nominated screen play , should have won . i give the film four stars only because of the very soft picture . otherwise , it would earn a resounding five stars . i have been waiting a long time for this film to be on dvd , but to find that they are insulting robert ryan again by providing poor quality dvds of many of his films now on dvd . most recent example in billy budd , which i also have been waiting to be on dvd for eons . both the naked spur and billy budd should have been given first class treatment . naked is only marginally superious to the vhs due to the soft picture ( mann 's other westerns have been transferred better ) . my vhs copy of billy budd is superior to the dvd . i definitely wo n't buy the dvd . another reviewer mentioned that a few minutes of billy budd were deleted in order to fit it on the dvd . i wonder which scenes they were . as for the naked spur , it is another ryan masterpiece in engendering some degree of audience sympathy for an essentially psychopathic personality . it is amazing how an actor such as ryan can interpret malevolence so well , yet be a peace activist in real life . when ryan 's ben vandergroat cooly murders jesse tate , his deep seated cold bloodedness , which has only been talked about up to that point in the film , occurs at the moment when ben kills jesse . ryan 's final line to janet leigh as he lays in ambush for james stewart and ralph meeker encapsulates his situation : `` pretty soon roy and your friend howie are gon na show up . then i 'll get me some more insurance against dying young .
