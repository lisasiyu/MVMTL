a film that hardly stands out but it 's a good pass time ! i like this film because several reasons , unlike most of the national lampoon 's i 've recently seen , this was the least silly & disgusting . there was a better plot to it , paris hilton is a fine actor ! alot of people would say she 's playing herself in this movie but if u think that , then u do n't really know her . but i 'm not getting into that . now to the plot , veronica ( hilton ) is the hottest girl in the school , popular , dating the `` hottest '' guy on campus & is totally rich ! looking to win a chance to get a photoshoot for fhm , she needs the hottest girls to compete with her . only that does n't go so well when she starts treating some of the wannabees like crap & they decide to retaliate . there is a journey of self-discovery , lessons to be learned but it 's not a big part of the film & kinda comes from nowhere . lots of this does n't make sense but who cares . it 's a very cheesy flick but it has humor , nudity , all the things u 'd want from a national lampoon 's flick & i give it points for trying something new & actually having a point to the film ! i say it 's a good film to see , though maybe not a family film , it 's still worth your time !
