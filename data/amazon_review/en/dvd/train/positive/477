mission impossible tv series anyone who has seen the mi films will not be disapointed with this series and it isnt about bike chases car chases blowing things up all the time etc it is about careful srtategic planning with gadgets or masks or by any other means to dupe the perpetrators involved in to believing something is really happening so the mi team can remove them to stop them being a threat to society . each member has his own skills . i think you will enjoy this series it gets better as it goes on
