good thought provoking themes well done although some people might not like the melancholic feel of this movie , it a well done piece exploring the theme of personal redemption and forgiveness . people do n't always approach these topics in the same way and this movie does n't try to spin a single , simple answer . the notable cast works well creating a compelling tale . a great movie to talk about after viewing . highly recommend
