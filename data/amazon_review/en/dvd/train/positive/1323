very very good movie this film is a very good one..it has mystery , horror , style good acting . the crows annoyed me to bits but that was part and parcel of what made the film so creapy . the camera work is second to none and i believe is ahead of it 's time ; how they found the killer is beyond me but even that was a good stroke . the lead actress was a bit over the top with the noise she made and she to me failed to cut it as the opera singer type and she looked stilted while performng the opera scenes but she was nice in her role . filled with twists and turns it 's ending rivals any i 've seen for drama . this is highly recommended by me..highly . the score is just awesome
