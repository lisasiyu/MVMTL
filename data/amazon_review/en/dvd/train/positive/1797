my little nit to pick ... i think there 's already enough reviews on this complaining about the lack of dvd features , the quality , and the awfulness of the movie ( that 's the point , people ! ! ! ) . but i loved it ! it was hilarious ! except ... my roommate and i were disappointed that there was no making out at the end ... only the beginning , which was completely irrelevent to the rest of the movie
