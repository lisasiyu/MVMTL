frighteningly good being a big fan of horror and scray movies i consider this movie to be a success . as it succeeded in doing what it intended , it scared the crap out of me . i would say it is one of the scariest movies i have ever seen , those japanese sure know how to scare people . the storyline is actually quite good too , and while the acting is n't quite inspirational , it is quite good by all involved . the movie making is of a high quality and all up , this is a very good movie , well worth buying and watching over again
