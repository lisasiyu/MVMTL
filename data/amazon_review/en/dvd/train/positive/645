change of heart . . . this is a gently heartbreaking film set in tehran , a city flooded with afghan refugees during the time of taliban rule in their homeland . it touches on several themes , including the plight of the refugees , and those of them who work illegally as laborers in the construction industry . much of the story takes place at a construction site , where the central character , a young iranian , a short-tempered lad full of complaints about his lowly status among the other workmen , gradually discovers within himself a heartfelt compassion for the refugees in the person of a girl masquerading as a boy to support the family of her disabled father , injured at the work site . the young man 's compassion is ignited by the love he begins to feel for this girl , and there begins a series of selfless sacrifices that he makes for her and her family . though they never exchange a word in the film , she leaves a deep impression on him , and he is utterly changed by his experience . a story that is about the transformation of character , the film sometimes struggles to externalize this process , often observing the main character as he watches from the sidelines , wordlessly ponders his situation , or goes in search of the girl and her family . director magid magidi compensates in part by revealing the working conditions of the men , the difficulties of the contractor in charge of them , and the unforgiving weather ( snow , rain , cold ) in which they all labor . recommended for the window it opens into a world rarely revealed by the cinema or the news media
