francis ford coppala 's first musical coppala was right out of college when he was asked to do `` finian 's rainbow '' . it had been a big hit on broadway in the 40 's but predated the civil rights movement . coppala had the task of updating it for 1968 . fred astaire is 69 in the title role and this was his last role dancing and singing . this was the first times since the beginning of astaire 's career that he did n't have control over the direction of his musical numbers . coppala was an inexperienced director and fired hermes pan , fred 's chorographer . he admits that it was his fault that fred 's big number in the film did n't come out the way should . petula clark is wonderful as astaire 's daughter . tommy steele who was also in `` the happiest millionare '' and `` half a sixpence '' plays a part typical of his personality . there is very little chemistry between petula clark and her love interest , dan franck . plot : finian ( astaire ) is an irishman that steals a pot of gold from og ( tommy steele ) . he heads torainbow valley , which is right next to fort knox , kentucky , where he thinks burying the gold will multiply his riches . he meets some people , woody and silent sue , and gives them money to save their land from the bigot senator ( keenan wynn ) . in return he wants part of their land to secretly bury the gold . og follows finian to get his gold back . he is turning into a mortal because he has lost his pot of gold . meanwhile , finian 's daughter ( petula clark ) is falling in love with a local , woody ( dan franck ) . nicely restored with great special features . includes a commentary with coopala that actually has a mini documentry before it . featurette is the world premere with interviews with the stars
