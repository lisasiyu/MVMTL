`` gettin ' down with the fanny lifter '' this is an excellent workout . i love the firm workouts . i have lost 60 pounds and counting doing firm workouts 4-5 times a week along with eating a healthy diet . it uses light , medium , and heavy dumbbells , the fanny lifter , and the sculpting stick . its a cardio + sculpt video . i really enjoy the step aerobics segment . emily is a great leader . she cues well and she is energetic . this video has an extra long stretching part ( i think its about 12 minutes ) in the end which is very relaxing and really soothes your muscles after working them so hard in the workout . highly recommended
