good for some laughs this is a pretty good effort for a warner home video dvd release.you get two laurel & hardy feature films on one single sided disc with nice artwork.considering that these films are over 60 years old the audio & video quality is surprisingly good.if you 're a fan of laurel & hardy , this dvd is definitely for you.this is good clean fun from one of the best comedy teams ever
