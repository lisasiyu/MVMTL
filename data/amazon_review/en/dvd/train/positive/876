unique kung fu delight steve oedekerk ( the writer of the film bruce almighty ) directed , wrote and starred in this quite silly kung fu spoof . though one hesitates to call it groundbreaking , kung pow is genuinely remarkable , in that much of it is composed of scenes from a 1977 chinese film with modern actors smoothly and digitally inserted into them . watch the credits at the end for examples of what i 'm talking about . because of this creative juxtaposition , kung pow manages to create a comedic atmosphere that is uniquely its own . it really does `` feel '' like a vintage martial arts film , yet the dialogue is so extraordinarily silly and the timing is so odd , it just wrings laughs out of you . sidelight : the entire movie is dubbed , and oedekerk also did all the voices for every character ( except whoa . ) to further the bad dubbing effect , oedekerk wrote a fake script of gibberish for the modern actors to repeat on-camera
