make your own film i hate people who complain that films do n't have enough of some element , some band who they want to see . there are enough oasis , blur and pulp videos out there to catch up on . there is john harris ' britpop book . britpop was a media invention . it is a tired subject . but it did happen . it is essential to talk about the blur vs . oasis thing at some point . i feel that this film succeeded at some point . there are another hour of interviews with the bands as a bonus . if you do n't like this film , make your own . it will probably suck . it will probably have a thousand close shots of jarvis cocker . that is just fandom . that is monomania . that is not narrative filmmaking
