a musical vision fulfilled - townes van zandt and friends i was stunned by this movie . i learned of it and purchased it in 2003 . for various reasons it remains for me the best , most emotional movie i have seen about musicians and their music . the producer chose well : he found the songwriters that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years : townes van zandt , rodney crowell , steve earle , guy clark , steve young , john hiatt , charlie daniels and a tribute to the late skinny dennis , immortalized in guy clark 's `` la freeway . '' i wish david allen coe had been left out , but no film is perfect . the songwriters are shown at their best and worst : a drunken , funny tvz falls into a rabbit hole and silent night is rendered by fine musicians too drunk to remember the lyrics . this movie was made when i was a poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends in tampa at the university of south florida . the difference is that most of my friends and i got straight jobs [ we still tried to make a difference ] but these musicians changed the world , just a little . i married the singer/business major i met at usf and divorced 30 years later . i still play guitar , write and record at home and dream of making it in music - but mostly i learn songs written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand the magic they have that still captures me . when tvz sang 'waiting around to die ' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+ blacksmith neighbor , while cindy comforts him . it was magical . tvz does a `` medley of my hit '' and sings `` pancho and lefty , '' and rodney crowell sang `` bluebird wine , '' both covered by emmylou . steve young 's `` alabama highways '' was wonderful too . it was a look into my past - and the past and future of the intelligent , emotional music i love best .
