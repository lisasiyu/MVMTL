for a few dollars more ... . ... .you can buy them all separately and maybe get some actual liner notes ! ! ! when i bought this , i thought the slipcover holding all three films was pretty nifty . what weirded me out was that all the movies were not shrink-wrapped , and the liner notes or liner card on the inside front covers were missing . the topper was my copy of fistful of dollars had rip marks on the very top of the back cover paper . i 'm about to put them in the player to see if i 'm getting top quality or irregular materials . my advice is to just buy these separately
