brother , can you spare a dime is a great movie my name is amanda and i 'm in a 10th grade world history class . we are currently studying the great depression and wwii and we have just finished watching brother , can you spare a dime . this movie helped me to understand not only the culture and life of this era but also helped me to understand the things that led up to the depression and stock market crash as well as pearl harbor and wwii . i 'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants an entertaining way to learn a bit about history
