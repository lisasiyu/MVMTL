it 's supposed to be funny - and it is ! being scottish , maybe i 'm biased but this is a brilliant , laugh out loud funny , film . i looked at its reviews on the us amazon site just to see what the americans made of it - especially the accents . they 're really not that `` thick '' as many reviewers state - i think even viewers from england understood them . also , trainspotting is intentionally funny ; our sense of humour is not the same as yours though . do n't even think of reading the book if you found the accents unintelligible - its full of colloquial scots ( not scotch - thats the drink ) .theres also many even more gruesome scenes in the book than in the film .
