there 's an eye in my soup ! the corpse bride did n't quite captivate me like the nightmare before cristmas did , but even so it was an imaginative and entertaining claymation film with great animation and interesting character designs . the movie 's dark use of colors creates the feeling of a black and white film . the story sparkles with witty puns , for instance , we hear the bride say : ''that just takes my breath away ... or it would if i had any breath ! '' this is a cleverly written , beautifully animated film that should be enjoyed by anyone over the age of eight .
