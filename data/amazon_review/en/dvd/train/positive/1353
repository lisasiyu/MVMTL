american knitter learn how to knit 3 dvd set i just received this dvd set on tuesday and by thursday i have learned to cast on the proper way , knit , purl , increase , decrease , cast off , hold my yarn the proper way etc . etc . tracy is the greatest ! ! i feel like i went from an insecure beginner to a confident intermediate knitter in just two days . i have n't even begun dvd lesson number 3 , but i am secure in the fact that i will master it and become an intermediate or better knitter because of this awesome teacher . she is friendly , patient , and very pleasant and caring as she guides you through each step of the way . i hope she will put out another series where she teaches you to understand knitting patterns . thanks tracy !
