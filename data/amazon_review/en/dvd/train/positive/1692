i 've seen so far the first three episodes i love the x-files , i was in my grad school at the time it came out so i missed the first three- four years . this was a great way to see them all . i 'm a si-fi kinda guy so this was easy to buy . i hated when it got cancelled . it 's great to see the beginning and to now understand what 's going on and the history behind foxes obsession . the products i recieved are great and nice to know i can recieved them with an apo address . thank
