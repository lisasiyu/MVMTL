around the world with superman as someone who loved this wonderful series during the 50 's and in sindication in later years - i still love it today - at age 51 . as many have said - it seems that george reeves was the one and only person to portray superman . he had the charm , charisma , the classic fine features , sense of humor , as well as very appealing vocal and acting qualities many actors today i 'm sure - wish they had . and of course - that wonderful smile of his that few could resist . i have read that he was a very nice person to work with on the set and was always very sensitive and kind to others . however - i 'm not sure if everyone out there who loved him in the role knew how much he loved children and how much he did for them . i 've heard and read many interviews about him and his portrayal of superman and how he would devote many hours entertaining sick children in hospitals as the man of steel . many children indeed - looked up to him as their own superman and the great and wholesome role model he portrayed . `` around the world with superman '' the last episode in the second season dvd , very nicely shows george 's sensitivity and love for children as he tries to help a young blind girl regain her sight and takes her on a once in a lifetime flight around the world - in his arms . when he first visits the girl in her mother 's apartment as clark kent and as superman - with the aid of the wonderful background music that made the 50 's series so memorable and enjoyable - one can clearly see george reeve 's love for children in his voice and the things he says to her and way he looks at the young girl . indeed - a very touching and sensitive episode , and in my humble opinion - a very nice and memorable tribute to george .
