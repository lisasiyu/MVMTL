luther - - best historical presentation of martin luther ever this dvd is the best historical presentation of martin luther ever and the corruption that existed in the middle age church , which would not change until there were such violent protest in northern europe . i recently purchased 7 copies and in total i have purchased about 12 copies to give as gifts . i also requested our local library purchase a copy . i do not consider this dvd as entertainment , but it is history done better than any other historical film . one should also research the events occuring in england , and the americas which were part of the holy roman empire , and understand that charles v , holy roman emperor , is a great-nephew of catherine of argon , king henry viii 's first wife ; and that he is also a decendent of ferdnand and isabel of spain . the dvd will allow you to see the logic behind selling indulgences and the need to finance st peters basilica in rome . this is a dvd that you will want to view several times as it is so profound . peter ustinov and alfred molina give unforgetable performances in supporting roles
