excellent doc about an amazing photographer this is an incredible documentary . a must for anyone interested in photojournalism as well as all those truly interested in world peace . a calm , thoughtful photographer continually stepping into dangerous and tragic circumstances and capturing for us and humanity glimpses of the horrific reality of war that are so often and increasingly ignored by the mainstream press in favor of superficial entertainment .
