if you 've never been to a wiggles concert ... you 'll love this video ! even though i 've only been to two concerts , i felt a little cheapened watching this because it kind of slaps you in the face with how canned the whole wiggles concert experience is . we got this for my son 's 3rd christmas , and he has happily watched it a few times . it 's a great way to relive the concert experience ! the feature with king mondo doing `` eagle rock '' is good , too
