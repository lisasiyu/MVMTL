a romantic/emotional roller coaster why some have condemned this movie for the lack of story line , i praise what factual information they were able to find although there was never any final meeting between hemmingway and agnes . all correspondence was done through letters between them after hemmingway went home from the war and little is known of the letters hemmingway wrote angus since a later boyfriend of angus destroyed all of hemmingway 's letters in a jealous rage . if there was in final face to face meeting , both their lives may have very different . more than likely the two would have continued far different lives together . hemmingway may have never gone on to become the great writer he was and agnes would have never continued her nursing career that she seemed much more married to , or a european whirlwind romance may have faded into the first of the many failed marriages hemmingway went through . although a bit contrived from reality ; the story line does make an impact emotionally . in my opinion though sir richard attenborough should have had his lead actors at least read a farewell to arms before attempting their roles . it might have helped out with acting that was a little flat and emotionless at times like they did n't have enough material on the original characters and were trying to ad lib . still it 's very much worthwhile watching this sometimes fictional account of a young hemmingway and his first and lost love
