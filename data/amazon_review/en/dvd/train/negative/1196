a must pass for true fans . i have loved riverdance since the first time i saw it on pbs . i could wait till i received my riverdance : live from new york dvd so many years ago . recently , i had a chance to see it on tour when it came to los angeles . i had been waiting for that moment so long and it was everything i could hope for ( with the exception of them having removed the song `` home in the heartland '' which any ture fan knows brought the story full circle ) . that night , i ordered not only riverdance : live from geneva , but also jean butler 's irish dance dvd ( which i would recommend ) . to make a long story short , do n't waste your time with this version of the show . the main female singer is absolutely horrible ( definitely does n't hold a candle to katie macmahon 's original vocals ) , and the lead female dancer 's too short hair drove me crazy . do yourself a favor and purchase the 1999 dvd live from new york . i promise you wo n't be disappointed
