horrible the storyline and acting in this movie are painful , to say the least . the main character , devon , is too annoying for words . the band directors of the dueling universities that make up this story are ridiculously melodramatic , and there is no plot line what-so-ever . i know we can expect these types of movies to stretch reality , but to show the main character begin school at one university , drop out and transfer to another university , and then return to the first university ... all in one semester was absurd . have the writers of this movie ever attended a university ? did they do any sort of research for this at all ? i would not recommend purchasing or renting this movie . it is not worth the money . if you feel you must see this monstrosity , i would borrow it from a friend who was unfortunate enough to buy it , pull up the main menu , and go straight to the scenes with the band performances . the whole movie is garbage and a waste of time .
