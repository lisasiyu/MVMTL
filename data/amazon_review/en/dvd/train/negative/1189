a true loss of faith . faith hathaway had just graduated high school and was one week away from going into the army . she was full of hope and life . robert willie ( the man this movie was based on ) , along with his accomplice raped and murdered her . she was raped , stabbed 17 times , and raped after she died . the director of this movie denied requests made by faith 's mother , and gave all the attention to the only person who deserved to die . where was the mercy for faith ? where was the compassion for faith ? where were the people protesting for faith 's life ? finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to faith ? what about her suffering and that of her family ? barely a foot note in this movie . ohh and sister prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case .
