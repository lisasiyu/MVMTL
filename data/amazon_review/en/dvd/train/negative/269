cheap sopranos rip off falls way short i like gangster movies and am from philly so i gave this movie a chance . what a mistake . the creators painstakingly tried to rip off the sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation . it starts with the horrible theme song . it 's obviously trying to sound similar to the a3 song that serves as the sopranos theme , but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it . the cast is filled mediocre actors , trying in vain to save a stupid script . one funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent , and with the exception of one guy , no one can do a south philly accent . sal mazzotta is trying real hard to be james gandolfini as tony soprano , but i 'm sorry ... he may be a nice guy in real life , but the guy could n't act scared in a graveyard at midnight . and come on ; this guy as a gangster ? maybe as lurch in the adams family . this movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work . i mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking . do n't they teach that in film school ? and usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot , and at completely different angles for close ups , like maybe the close up stuff was done much later . save your money . wish i could get mine back . it 's been a long time since i saw a movie so bad i felt angry and ripped off for having seen it .
