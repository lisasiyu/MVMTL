bow wow i ca n't understand the good reviews given by others to this movie . frankly , i thought it was a dog . not to say that it had no redeeming features - the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing , if improbable . and the girl herself was a real sweetie , and a good actress - perfect for the part . in fact , the acting all around was admirable . but the script ! yikes ! not a single character in the whole movie - with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists - had any motivation for anything they did . people acting awkward or mean ( in fact , just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean ) , or spiteful , or stupid , for no reason at all ! it seems as though somehow , the movie could have been good , but did n't make it . call it almost watchable . i came away from lawn dogs ( yawn dogs ? ) feeling not at all enriched . puzzled , perhaps , at why anyone would make such a movie . well , there was that admirable , unlikely friendship . but that was all . pass this one by
