really old really fast for some reason , i fell into the trap of believing a dvd that consists of all of eminem 's music videos would be really cool . it really is n't . in fact , i have only watched this dvd once . the music videos are great , but how many times do you really think you are going to watch them . the extras are definetely not worth the purchase . once again , how many times are you going to watch the making of stan . the extra that mocks the blair witch project is also just really really bad . overall , do n't buy this . download the music videos and spend your money elsewhere . actually , go use it to see 8 mile
