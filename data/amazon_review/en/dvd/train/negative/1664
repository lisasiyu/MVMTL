confusing , slow , and sub par acting jesus , i 'm not sure that they could have picked a worse cast for this terrible movie . the only redeeming thing about it , was mia kirshner who gave an amazing performance as elizabeth short . but besides her i the story was windy and contrived , too many characters and nit enough convincing acting to really pay attention too closely to . mia kirshner is the only reason this movie gets two stars from me .
