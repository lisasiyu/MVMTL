you 've got to be kidding after seeing feet of flames , lotd and riverdance , other shows are hard-pressed to even come close to the adrenalizing delivery of the aforementioned productions . one of the main characters in the show , an older gent , walks around the stage throughout the production which starts out as simply awkward because everyone around him is dancing and he 's pretty much a statue . it eventually becomes flat out annoying because in a show full of irish dancers , he does nothing but grimace and stand around . it 's unfortunate the talents of jean butler and colin dunne came up with something as weak as dodg . you watch each number with disappointment hoping the next will turn things around but it never happens . the story had potential but this show becomes nothing more than soda without the fizz . no wonder it died financially and never reached the states
