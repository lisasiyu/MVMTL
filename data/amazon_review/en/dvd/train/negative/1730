sucks . garbage . they tweaked it in every place that did n't need tweaking . straker is no longer bald , matt burke is no longer caucasion , and now he 's gay . the bus driver is now a vietnam vet instead of korea . in this adaptation , ben mears was the kid who found the bodies of hubie marsten and his wife . the story begins in winter instead of late summer . ralphie glick does n't just go missing , he 's drowned in an icey pond . instead of ben mears coming to town and finding the marsten house already sold , crockett has already promised it to mears , but now he 's renegged and sold it out from under him . i do n't see the point . they did n't just change the story , they did n't leave anything intact . it 's bad . it 's unwatchable , especially if you loved the book . none of the characters have maine accents ... hmm . could it have been filmed in ... oh i dunno ... australia perhaps ?
