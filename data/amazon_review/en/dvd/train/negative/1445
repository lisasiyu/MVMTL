come back to the 5 and dime , pauline kael , pauline kael for you young'uns , pauline kael was a powerful , maverick movie critic who , aside from being a brilliantly entertaining writer , often went against the grain of your rex reeds and roger eberts and viewed and wrote about movies with a depth and clarity that seemed super-human . and smart as hell . this movie has fooled many into thinking it is somehow clever , beautiful and enlightening . i could not find one less-than-amazed review at rottentomatoes.com from writers that shoud know better . but friend , think about it just a little bit , how this movies titillates mentally-restful viewers by using the cheapest of devices ; by baring the breasts of doe-eyed 15 year olds - friggin ' kiddie porn in 2 scenes no less ! and the protagonist 's spiritual awakening consists of smoking pot , working at a fast food joint ( with a cliched smiley face logo ) , driving a hot cherry-red pontiac and having sex with a 15 year old ( which is a crime in the us , ja ? no ? ) . kevin spacey 's original and complex-toned smart-assiness is entertaining and the young girl players are fascinating and beautiful . annette bening , given a straw woman stereotype role that begs to be burned , in the course of 6 seconds still manages to move us in the finale . another amazon reviewer cited ray lawrence 's austrailian film from 1987 , bliss as the misinterpreted and maladapted source material for american beauty . having seen bliss several times , and being a huge fan of that movie , i think he is correct . written by alan ball , a tv sitcom writer , this film pushes a screwed-up message . it entertains , that is if your brain is on stand-by . i wish pauline was still alive to help sharpen our movie vision
