one of the worst adaptations ever made . sure there are other movies that have butchered their source material beyond recognition , but it 's not even the butchering that 's the problem . the problem comes when the director hits all the marks and completely misses the point of the book . jan de bont decided to take the atmospheric haunting of hill house and turn it into a carnival ride and give an easy explanation to the haunting . depalma went and decided to tone down the racism in bonfire of the vanities . but those weird decisions to miss the point pale in comparison to shlessinger 's choice of turning a vicious novel into sentimental slop . from the opening sequence with the tinkling piano music to the ending with faye sighing at tod 's stupid rose , this movie sets out to jerk tears and make the viewer feel bad . even if there was n't a great book to be killing , this would be a terrible movie . but with day of the locust as a source material , the awfulness of this movie borders on the criminal . one imagines the book done right by a quentin tarantino or a todd solondz . where the book is fast , the movie is slow . tod hackett is supposed to be a fat cynical observer but shlessinger decided to cast an anonymous pretty boy in his role . the casting choice is decidedly better with donald sutherland as homer simpson , but sutherland is emoting way too much pain for the humor to come through . every time you see him you want to kill yourself and his abuse at the hands of faye goes on forever . the riot scene that ends the movie becomes a night of the living dead ripoff and the whole thing just drags on . furthermore , the key sequence of the book ( tod imitating the police sirens ) gets lost and tod just cries and gnashes his teeth or something . this is a terrible movie . the original book deserves much better
