embarrasing whilst i do like jessica and nick , ( i was a fan of jessica since `` i 'm gon na love you forever '' and i always liked 98degrees ) , this is embarrasing . on newlyweds , i think she 's actually funny . i love the show and i do n't see the negatives that people talk about . this however was different . i ca n't beleive they need the money , so jessica and nick - don '' t do this again . i could n't believe they did such stupid rubbish and kept a straight face . it 's fine to do songs along with other famous singers , but do n't sing with a car , and do n't do pole-vaulting across the stage and then act high at other times . yes there are some good moments in this , but overall , ? i was cringing considerably
