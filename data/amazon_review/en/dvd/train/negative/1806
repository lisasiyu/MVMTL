a disappointment ! i must agree with a few others on here that i was disappointed with this version of 'peter pan ' . pros : -cathy rigby 's skill as an olympic gymnast really gave peter a great element of athleticism . great voice and fun actress . -scenic design and set design all really nicely done , a bit predictable , but predictable is what an audience wants to see when they to to a production of 'peter pan' cons : -the cuts ! like others have said , this production is totally rushed and they made some weird cuts . -the face value acting does n't go deep enough into the characters . while all these performers are skilled individuals , i was not impressed with their acting . however , this could be partially the fault of the director as well . -the lip synching was a huuuuuuge disappointment ! -i do n't understand what the deal is with the adults playing lost boys . yes , adult performers can often perform more sophisticated choreography , but a certain nostalgia and innocence is brought to the production when actual kids are invovled . with all that said , i think that kids would love this video . however , as a musical theatre student there are several shortcomings to this production overall . nice musical , so-so interpretation . :
