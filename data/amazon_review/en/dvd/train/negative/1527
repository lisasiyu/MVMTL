terrible-do n't waste your money this supposed 'language lab ' is very poorly designed . the dvd consists of images of items with a nursery rhyme or poem being recited in another language . the amazing thing is that the item shown has no relation to the words being spoken ! it might as well be completely random sounds , since anyone who has studied child language acquisition knows that babies learn from making observations of language used in context . while i understand that supposedly this dvd is only intended to 'stimulate ' the brain , by six months , a baby 's brain has developed specifically to hone in on the sounds presented in his own native language , and to selectively ignore others . the brain continues to prune and forge neural networks in response to sounds from the language spoken in the home , thus the idea that random speech sounds are somehow beneficially stiumlating is invalid . a baby 's brain becomes stimulated by the sounds that appear repeatedly in his own language . habituation and imaging studies have shown this time and time again . imagine if the baby 's brain gave equal attention to any sound -- the brain would waste valuable time and resources on information that would not be useful in learning to communicate with his caretakers . we acquire langauge so rapidly because the brain is selective . babies depend heavily on repitition , adult modeling , observing cause and effect , and from watching other people 's behaviors to learn language . the idea that your child with learn anything from just hearing forgien language sounds out of context is very silly . if you want your child to learn language sounds and words from a language not spoken in the home , try exposing him to another language speaker on a routine basis , or show him programs like dora or sesame street , where there is lots of explicit context to help a baby infer meaning , clear annunciation , and repition .
