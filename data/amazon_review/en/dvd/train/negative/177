for die hard kutcher fans only . the movie starts off very slowly , with childhood episodes from ashton kutcher 's character . it 's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult kutcher , although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene . the premise is good , and it has some good momentum in the middle , which is why i gave it two stars . the shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done , but the overall story line is very weak , and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story . also , the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to kutcher 's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to `` tighty-whities . '' they distract from the story , and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- if you are not a kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie , skip this one
