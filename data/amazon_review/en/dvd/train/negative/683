how are people rating this 5 stars i should first say that i have not watched the series , but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so . i am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime 's i have enjoyed include dragon ball z , outlaw star , cow boy bebop and ninja scroll . if you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was `` big top pee-wee '' , then maybe ( and i stress maybe ) i could understand a 5 star review . if you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you . if you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this . however if you expect depth of character , story evolution and strong plot , skip this . in a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/die , what ever , so she disappears and shows up in gaea as the wing goddess . two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world . the girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides ; the good guys get it the end . believe me when i say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one . the good : a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good . the bad : the tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized . the characters are n't developed at all so you ca n't really bring your self to care about them , or want to pay attention to them . the movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably . i considered turning this off several time but felt that i should finish and form a complete opinion about it . well i have and it aint good .
