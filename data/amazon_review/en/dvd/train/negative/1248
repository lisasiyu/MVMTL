not a family movie . despite the cute sounding description , this is not a family movie . the constant undertone of the movie is the sexual tension between the two characters and the utterly absurd emotional reactions of the heroine . the idea of the movie was a good one but once again hollywood messed it up . we were very disappointed and threw the video out .
