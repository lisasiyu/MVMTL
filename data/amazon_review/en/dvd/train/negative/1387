dissapointment season where ideas ran out i am a big fan of the pretender series and i just wanted to share my disappointment 's on season 4 where it 's an ending of a comedy season and not a fun season that we 've seen in first 3 seasons . i believe they ran out of ideas and they just wanted to fill in the blanks and put any crap . i was really disappointed . : ( i recommend no one to buy it , not to mention it 's pretty expensive as it is .
