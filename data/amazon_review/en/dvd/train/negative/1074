for your own safety , make sure you know where the emergency exits are at all times '' i did not expect much from this comedy , i just wanted to have a few laughs . i knew that many critics hated it and advised the viewers to stay away from it . well , they did not like `` meet the fockers '' , either but i had a great time watching it . they praised `` something 's got ta give '' to the high heavens but i wanted to kill somebody while suffering through so called `` one of the best comedies of the year '' . they universally agree that latest woody allen 's comedies suck - and i believe that they ( woody 's comedies not the critics ) are funny and enjoyable . plus , jane fonda came out of retirement to make `` monster-in-law '' , her first movie in 15 years . i saw a few weeks ago fonda 's `` barbarella '' , one of the silliest and campiest movies ever made and i liked it a lot , mostly due to fonda 's charm . i watched `` monster-in-law '' last night and i found it uninteresting , boring , and irritating . the worst quality - it is not funny . forget about laughs , i hardly smiled at all . i almost fell asleep - its 101 minutes seemed like eternity . every twist in so- called plot was predictable , every joke -stupid , the ending - sappy and mediocre . in one word , the movie was a mess with only one redeeming value - wanda sykes ( ruby ) as fonda 's personal assistant . both , j.lo and jf tried hard to do something with the material but it just did not work . in the perfect world , if woody allen had written the script and made the movie with three of them , fonda , lopes , and sykes - we could 've had if not a masterpiece but a wonderful and funny comedy . alas , we are not in the perfect world and this monster is not scary , it is just pathetic .
