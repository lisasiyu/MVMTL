cliche ridden , `` worst of kung fu '' waste of time ! with all due respect to different tastes , i found five deadly venoms lethally boring . i thought the dialog was trite and incoherent , the humor lame and predictable , the martial arts stunts and display average to bad . the plot lack subtlety , imagination or surprise and although some of the sets and costumes looked authentic , i could not finish this loser . perhaps it was better than bad when it first came out , but hard to watch after more recent kung fu fare .
