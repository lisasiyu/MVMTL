a regular snoozefest ... .. this is a dumb boring movie . i actually think this movie would be better to watch in 2d than 3d . the 3d in this movie sucks badly , and in order to really appreciate the campiness of the bad acting , direction , characters , and storyline -- one must not be waiting in eager anticipation for 3d scenes that simply do not deliver . if you are looking for good 3d -- please do not buy this . these `` reviewers '' who review this movie either have an affiliation with the studio that released it or simply have not really experienced any good 3d movies and are just reviewing out of ignorance . the field sequential in this movie is horrible , due mostly to the fact that so much of the movie takes place indoors- inside small cramped looking rooms that do not offer up any depth of field ! ! i dont care if the entire movie is shot in field sequential ... ... if there is no depth to the picture ... then there is no real 3d ! if you are looking for beyond excellent 3d , then get yourself a copy of `` alien adventure '' , `` encounter in the third dimension '' , or `` the haunted castle '' . i have reviews of all these movies movies in my profile ... .. i love horror , i love 3d , and i love cult and b movies but this movie just could not hold my interest for long . i have stopped and started it 3 times since i have received it , and have yet to finish the end of the movie . again ... ..maybe in 2d -- but stay away from the lousy 3d version . it downright sucks
