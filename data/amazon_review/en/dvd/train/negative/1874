dvd purchase i am stationed in iraq and recently purchased the hunter ( steve mcqueen ) through amazon and when i received it and went to play it , the disk started skipping . i guess this gives me the opportunity to ask what i can do , if anything to return the dvd and get it replaced . my dvd player is new and i have since watched a couple of other new dvds in it with no problem . i have made other purchases through amazon , but this was a really disappointing experience .
