the only thing scary about this is the acting first off , terrible acting . it seems so unreal . it 's just like nine four year olds playing hide and go seek . paris 's character jo gets killed in the first fifteen minutes after getting a bath , which i can only imagine how much she loved flaunting that body of hers . : ( the only thing interesting was the hot british and scottish actor guys ! other than that , lame lame lame ! !
