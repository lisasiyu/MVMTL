skip this one , get the original ! over half of this movie consists of scenes taken from the original 1939 classic film directed by zoltan korda . even those scenes ca n't disguise the remake 's network tv-movie quality . beau bridges is generally a good actor , but he is terribly miscast on this film . go rent both versions of the four feathers and see it for yourself
