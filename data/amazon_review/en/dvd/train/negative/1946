oscar wilde lite as other reviewers have been , i 'm also unhappy with the removal of central plot elements , especially mrs. cheveley 's broach . the effect of removing this element is that it is chiltern who saves goring , not goring who saves chiltern , and the play therefore never gives goring his moment of heroism and nobility . this film is too jolly and innocent . laura cheveley 's hubris , robert chiltern 's anguish , these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on goring , his wit , and his pre-marital uncertainty . i do think the film is entertaining , for what it is worth . anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in wilde will probably enjoy it . if you know this play and oscar wilde well , though , you may be frustrated
