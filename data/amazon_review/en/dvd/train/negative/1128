it 's 10 o'clock . do you know why your children are cackling insanely ? `` reefer madness '' ( originally `` tell your children '' ) was created to teach parents that it 's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids . through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of marihuana ( mike nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter j ) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin . we see firsthand that even teens who can quote shakespeare like nobody 's business can not escape its evils . here are some of the symptoms of casual marihuana use : - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street - playing the piano too fast - having sexual relations with people you do n't really like that much - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well - having no recollection of being framed for murder if your child has experienced any of these symptoms , he or she is a marihuana addict . the solution is simple : force them to watch `` reefer madness '' because if we do n't heed its warning , `` reefer madness 2 '' will be coming to a theater near you or you ... or you
