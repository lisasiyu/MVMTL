hard to watch the first 30 minutes of this movie are great . rick is cute and funny as his character is locked out of his dressing room and mobbed by adoring fans . the concert scenes are terrific and having seen rick in concert many times i enjoyed them very much . unfortunately , after the requisite `` beefcake shot '' of rick , the plot of the movie slides downhill into bad soap opera land . rick can act and i have seen him give some amazing performances . that said , this movie does n't show his skills in the best light . mostly because the writing is horrid but also because his co-star ( janet eiber ) is not much of an actress . rick does his best , but he 's left hanging by a bad script and a lame director . now , if you 're looking for some great rick springfield tunes , then this movie wo n't disappoint you in that respect . the soundtrack should have won a grammy . there are fantastic songs from rick ( one of my personal favorites `` stand up '' is fun and energetic and the hit `` love somebody '' is terrific concert footage ) , and other very good artists contribute including peter gabriel . my advice is skip the dvd and buy the soundtrack on cd . a much better investment
