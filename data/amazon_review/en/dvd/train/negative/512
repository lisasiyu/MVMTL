feeling a bit shafted okay , i 've wanted this film for a very long time , so this year i finally get around to ordering it . however , i was n't aware that ridley scott ever put together a director 's cut nor does the information contained about this particular edition say anything about this dvd being the director 's cut . so , it gets delivered , i open it up excitedly ... and see a box on the cover that says includes ridley scott 's director 's cut with jerry goldsmith 's score . okay , cool . it includes the director 's cut . that implies that both the theatrical release and the director 's cut are on the disc . not so . this is only the director 's cut ... and to be honest , it 's not all that great . and goldsmith 's score is not one of his better ones . i was wanting the theatrical release with that wonderful score by tangerine dream , the version i remember seeing so many years ago . so , now i have to shell out the money for the ultimate edition which has both versions on it . if amazon is going to sell two versions of this film it really needs to state clearly which is which . i feel about as shafted as when i bought `` the exorcist '' on dvd ... only to get the version you 've never seen , which was equally lame
