anti-southern propaganda this movies rates right up there with `` schindler 's list '' . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda . fortunately , ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making `` gettysburg , '' and the even better `` gods and generals . '' if you want to see a real , accurate depiction of the war for southern independence ( aka , the civil war ) , watch `` gods and generals '' or `` gone with the wind , '' and stay away from movie garbage like `` andersonville . '' also watch for the extended version dvd of `` gods and generals '' coming for the christmas season of 2005 .
