very silly legend of the eight samurai is just as bad as you 'd think it should be . the plot bounces around in a most confusing fashion , but who cares about what 's going on , anyway ? the word samurai is interchanged with ninja in this story . the cast includes such characters as the princess , necktie ninja , pantsless samurai , unloved lady ninja , elvis samurai , the evil queen , the old lady who tears her own face off , and a bevy of poisonous women . throw in tentacles and glowing blue balls , and the mst3k-style jokes happen all on their own . for ease of comprehension , all you need to remember is that the way of the samurai is death , and expect a final deathcount of shakespearian proportions
