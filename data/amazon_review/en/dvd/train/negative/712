wow boy this movie was weird and psycho . i happen to like the weird movies but it was way off the psycho side for me . friends try to cover up an `` accidental death '' from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong . things like this , i try to stay away from . although i am glad i saw it so i wo n't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not . now i know . i gave it 2 stars because the movie did have it 's charms .
