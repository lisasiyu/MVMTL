do 15 minutes make a movie great ? the answer is a big no ! after the first 15 minutes of this movie , which do n't get me wrong were quite awesome , the movie completely tanks at all levels . the movie was set in a mall , but did they use the mall to help them in any aspect of survival , no ! i read an interview with the director of this movie , and when asked about setting the movie in a mall , the director said that the mall was just a location and any other location would have worked just as fine . now look , when you 're using the title , `` dawn of the dead '' , you better remake it great , i mean really great . the followers of romero do not hand out free passes as easily as the gp . you know , i might not have had that big of a problem with this movie if the title were different . definately not when the same . if you want to see really good zombie movies , watch the original romero trilogy , 28 days later , the lucio fulci trilogy , or even the return of the living dead . heck , even the resident evil movies easily out did this stinker . do n't waste your time or money
