cliched story , inferior animation . we 're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and over the hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch . can anyone say buzz and woody ? chicken run ? the exterminator is the stock villain in cgi movies -- almost identical to the vintage toy collector in toy story 2 . how many times can you do the a-bomb joke ... worse still is the dialogue , the painfully unfunny one-liners , and the see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions . it is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another , and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest . there must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest . this film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry .
