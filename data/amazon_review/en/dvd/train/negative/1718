i just found this sad i 've always loved the smothers brothers - they were so gifted , so funny . but like so many show business people , they fooled themselves into thinking they were more important , more informed , and had greater insight into life than everyone else . what is it about a singer or comedian or actor that makes them think they have a firmer grasp of politics or foreign policy than those who have spent their lives studying and working in the field ? this show just highlights that sort of egotistical celebrity folly - they sacrificed their sweet funny comedy act so that their political opinions could be heard - and all it accomplished was to make sure we did n't get to hear their funny comedy or their political opinions ! why do n't more entertainers just listen to laura ingrahm when she says - '' shut up and sing ! '' ? i quit watching the tv show when they got political and this program reminds me why i did .
