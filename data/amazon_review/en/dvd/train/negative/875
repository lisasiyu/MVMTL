weak if you want to waste two hours of your life watching a movie about the most implausible hooker in the universe , you are in luck . jane fonda plays a call girl with a sensitive pimp and harmless businessmen for clients . she goes to a psychoanalyst on a regular basis to moan about her failed attempts to become an actress/model . all we see of her on the job is having sex with a few passive businessmen who meet up with her in high rise hotels and wait for fonda to guide them through the act of sex . donald sutherland stars as the world 's mopiest detective investigating the disappearance of some offscreen character . did i mention he is a man of few words ? most of sutherland 's screen time is spent in mute staring and trying not to react to anything . when he does say a few lines it is in a mumble that registers no emotion . his investigation consists of going up to hookers and asking them if they would like to be interviewed by him . 99 % of the movie is sutherland and fonda wandering around from one setting to another asking extras if they know something . like a guided tour
