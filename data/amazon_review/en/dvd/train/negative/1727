description very misleading this is not a story about black river falls , as the description indicates . it is a film about stories from around wisconsin as reported in a paper from black river falls , with some hokey footage of modern ( 1990 's ) day black river falls . there are very few photographs from the period and the film footage is mostly an attempt at what i can only call `` modern art '' . cut out about 20 minutes of `` filler '' and this would be a somewhat better film . basically , it 's a collection of `` strange but true stories '' that have no connection to each other , except they took place around the same period of time and took place somewhere in the state of wisconsin . and the modern footage makes no positive contribution at all . in fact , if i was from black river falls , i would be upset about how the town is portrayed . a complete waste of time and film
