i 'm confused ... . i saw this movie in the theater and still do n't really know what it 's actually about . i have to say though , that if you rank this `` film '' as a comedy , then it deserves 5 stars , sadly , i 'm pretty certain that uwe boll did n't mean it as such ( though i 'm sure he would say otherwise ) . despite this movie being as bad as it is , i have to say that it made for one of the best movie going experiences that i have ever had , the consesus of the viewing audience was that this movie was so bad , that noone minded one bit when everyone in the theater started heckling it out loud in mystery science theater fashion . the movie was fool of great moments and memorable lines like `` do n't be insane ! '' and virtually every word to come out of tara reid 's mouth , but the best part came when one of the characters called out for their lost friend marco and literally 5 people , including myself , could n't resist the urge to yell `` polo '' at the screen . this is one of those movies that 's so unbelieveably bad that it borders on being art ( if you consider taking a dump on a puppy artistic expression that is ) . it amazes me that there are people out there that may actually like this movie , i ca n't think of a single use for it , though i can honestly say that if a copy of this film were found in sadam huisein 's palace during operation iraqi freedom , then it certainly justifies going to war and is proof that saddam had at least one weapon of mass distruction
