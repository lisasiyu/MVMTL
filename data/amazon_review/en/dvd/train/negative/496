could n't have destroyed the story worse ... i suppose if you never read the book , you might think this movie is good ... maybe even charming . but having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel , i was so grossly disappointed i ca n't tell you . see , the book is about two people - novalee and willie jack . they head west together , until willie jack abandons her at a walmart . they part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can , and her life rises beautifully . it 's a study in contrasts , and it 's done impeccably in the novel , with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey ... but it did n't translate because of hollywood 's froo-froo mentality . hollywood cut benny goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved moses ( another major character ) down to a bit part while making novalee 's one-visit-mother a major player . and they destroyed forney ... who is supposed to be eccentric , late-thirties genius , withdrawn and strange ... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile . so . not . forney . i never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life . that horrid . and lexie ... she 's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and white-trash tendencies ... and they put ashley judd in the role . hello ... ? ! ? ! does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you ? that 's just the biggie complaints , too . read the book , do n't watch the movie . you 'll be amazed at how inept hollywood was at telling this story
