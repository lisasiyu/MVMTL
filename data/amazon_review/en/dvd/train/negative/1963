one of the absolute worst ! ! ! ! i actually caught this crapfest on the sci-fi channel the other night . that 's exactly what it was , a crapfest . i did n't even know i was looking at nick carter until i read some of these reviews , which i consider a blessing . no wonder that family has so many problems . and such veteran actors such as judge reinhold and stacy keach must have been really desperate for cash if they committed to this schlock . and do n't even get me started on the headless horseman . he was as about as convincing as a special effect in a cheesy 50 's science fiction movie . if you want to see the best version of the story , watch tim burton 's sleepy hollow . if you want originality , either watch ichabod and mr. toad or read the original story
