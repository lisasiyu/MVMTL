panning mania to the extreme but why ? ? ? what is up with this director desire to do overlapping and panning camera shots ? i mean if you going to use it a few times , as pointless as it is ... no problem but for every scene ? c'mon now ... aint we getting a little carried away here . i was dizzy after the first 5 minutes and still manage to watch the whole movie which is a feat that i challenge anyone here to take . you would most likely turn the movie off within 10 minutes and burst out profanities in the process . the only reason i watch the whole thing not because i wanted to know about this sick killer 's multiple personality defense interview but the person who was giving the interview , the ultra hot brittany daniel . we went gaga over her role as the devious temptress in dawson 's creek but as a 70 's chick doing the interview ... .omg ! it almost seems like she was enjoying the fantasy about this guy based on her expression and body movements . she was dress to kill with that 70 's disco outfit . the movie scenes was accurate to the times which is a plus . still it was a badly directed movie with horried camera work and the dialog was bad too ( accurate or not ) that even the lovely brittany cannnot save . not recommended even if your a fan of the hillside strangler . and if you are ... seek help !
