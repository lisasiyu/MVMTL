alexander and the terrible , horrible , no good , very bad movie i apologize the the children 's author for mis-using the title of a very good book , but it seemed so right ! assuming that the greeks lived much like the oliver stone asserts , and why not , then it was hard to be macedonian , greek , and royal . there is enough angst in this movie for the rest of alexander 's cut short life . three hours of this much angst is three hours too much . i give it 2 stars for the scenery , the story that is probably pretty spot on , and the fact that someone had the good sense to have sir anthony hopkins and christpher plummer in the movie . they are the redeeming features of the whole thing . but i would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a more historical venue . read a good book about it ! ! sorry , oliver , but it 's jfk all over again . plausible , but just not the case
