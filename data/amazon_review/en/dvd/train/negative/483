poorly done mocumentary 24-hour party people is a mocumentary at the lowest rung ( if best in show was not enough ) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste . the british scene in the 1980 's was influential and at the height of the 2nd brit wave , and michael winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way . my main issue with this film was it 's attempts at being funny in a hip-britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious . the dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway , and the film never really follows it 's premise as much as it should : the rise of factory . i did really enjoy the joy division segments , though , even if exploiting ian curtis 's death was slightly in poor taste . unless you 're a fan of the brit explosion of the post-punk era , and an extreme fan at that , i could not recommend this film . it 's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into .
