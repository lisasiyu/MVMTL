basically a 90 minute peta commerical . first off , i grew up with dogs , i have an affection for dogs . i even have respect for peta and their effort to ethically treat animals . that 's a good mission to have . but , that is a message that does not play well as this 90 minute movie . i mean with quotes like this `` maybe there are people like me behind the eyes of another creature . '' just went too far for me . this movie was too melodramtic and my wife was calling out the plot points about one minute before each one which made for an abysmal screenplay . the musical score was fine enough as was the melody . if you want a better dog movie , go get something like old yeller or where the red fern grows . both are probably equally molodramtic but at least they have a better story/screenplay to carry the story to the conclusion . this movie is literally for the dogs
