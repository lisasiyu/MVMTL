so disappointed , so very disappointed i laughed like a loon when i watched these shows as a kid . my sides hurt and tears came to my eyes . for years , i told people that that this was the best , most creative , funniest show ever aired . i tried for the longest time to find copies of even one show but i never did . suddenly , i found this collection on amazon and i was in heaven . when it arrived , i ripped it open and started to watch . i fell asleep before i got through the first episode . i was crushed . nary a laugh or even a snicker on the dvd . truly disappoined after decades of waiting . sigh !
