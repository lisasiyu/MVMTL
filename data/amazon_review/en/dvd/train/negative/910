among the worst movies of all time ... avoid it like the plague ! ! ! i knew going in that this would not be a masterpiece of filmmaking , but always the optimist , i naively assumed that it may have some redeeming virtues . i was wrong . every second watching this abomination is a second wasted . the script , acting , direction , sound , cinematography , plot , etc . are just plain awful . indeed , the overall quality is so low that it can not be explained simply by a lack of money or talent ... .it is like some awful inside joke played upon the audience . do n't fall for it .
