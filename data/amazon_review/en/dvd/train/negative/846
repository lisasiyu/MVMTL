fairy tale movie both versions are pretty much the same quality , only one is b & w and the other in color . i ca n't think of a more childish or ridiculous story as this one . it 's embarrassing even to tell it here . on a humoristic level i could stand it ( like the marx brothers films ) , but this story is told seriously . the characters read their parts of the script , they do n't interpret it , because it 's impossible to be natural with such lines . maybe some kid would like this film today ; i doubt it
