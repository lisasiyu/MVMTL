i wasted two hours of my precious life this movie has no plot ! yes , the characters say things and do things and things happene but that 's not a plot ! this movie wanders on aimlessly . what is it trying to say ? what is the point ? brian j white is a good actor . i loved him in the shield , but in this movie he over acts ! it 's like he has no talent at all . the white women in the film are stereotypes , especially the blonde . they played the same 2 or 3 pieces of music several times throughout the film whether they fit or not . one seemed to be played in every other scene . whomever wrote this needs to try again ! or not
