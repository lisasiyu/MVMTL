no stars from a cold war submariner i watched the film in the theater when it came out , was very disappointed in all the inaccuracies . trying to `` entertain '' / educate people on a subject matter so serious with a plot so ludicrous is irresponsible at best . the pet dog was cute but also unrealistic . the book `` the gold crew '' had a more believable plot . having served on a few ballistic missile submarines , i find it an insult to the crews of the boats especially to the captains and officers . it 's understandable why the navy refused to bless this . by placing there seal of approval on this film they would be saying it could happen , which it could n't as depicted . too much control and too many people in the loop to allow it . from november 15 , 1960-may 25 , 2001 . the navy completed 3500 deterrent patrols which roughly equates to 671 years of combined ship service on alert ready to launch . and there still out there boring holes in the water
