not a good film what else is there to say ? the acting is mediocre , the story line is nearly non-existent , and the only redeeming thing this film has to offer is the somewhat interesting cartoons superimposed upon the original score . the vast disconnect between the book and the movie is at its most evident when the film ends , concluding with a quote from phillip k. dick that has virtually nothing to do with what you 've just seen and makes you wish that it ( the film ) did
