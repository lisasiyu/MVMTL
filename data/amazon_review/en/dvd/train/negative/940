dissappointing i was n't expecting disney , but i was less than thrilled by this feature . i 'm assuming there 's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70 's that took the whole 'stoner ' heavy metal thing and ran with it . many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story . i am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything , but i could n't get through this whole film
