139 body count -- some appear to be the same after romero 's & quot ; dead -- movies & quot ; as well as & quot ; dead alive & quot ; and & quot ; bad taste & quot ; this movie is rotten.no real plot , and no characters with any depth.the director calls it art.this is another example of the depth horror movie making has fallen and many seem to think it 's really good.we are told that there are 139 deaths , but some of them seem repeated ad infintum.comic books do better than this.i guess if you were stoned and only were interested in a mess you might find this interesting.the most revolting things in the movie were when one character vomits on another and balls up snot to throw in a woman 's mouth.this mess cost too much money and was a complete waste of time.italians seem to do better with crappy gore than germans
