butterfly 's wings clipped this movie is not so much a sequel to the original , but simply a film that borrows that film 's premise and tries to rejuvenate it with different touches . ultimately , it does n't work because the script and pacing are weak , and although eric lively and erica durance are charming in their roles , their thespian skills do n't really convince us they 're sincere in their performances . there is also no real explanation for lively 's abilities and when he makes his final `` return '' , why does n't he just not go to work and then maybe ... well , do n't want to spoil it . it 's not a rotten movie , but it 's merely another direct to video release that wo n't stay with you too long
