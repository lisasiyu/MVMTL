great film , lousy dvd i 'm really tired of the shoddy dvd manufacturing used by many studios and distributors . this is a great film . i have it on tape . i was thrilled to see it 'd been released on dvd . i love italian knock-offs of american films ( street law seems inspired by death wish ) , and i 'm a barbara bach fan . so i bought this street law dvd brand new , as soon as amazon offered it , without waiting for the price to go down . i unwrap the pristine-looking dvdm pop it into the player , and after a few minutes it pauses . then it pauses again . it pauses constantly throughout the film . i mean at least once a minute , often several times a minute . pause , pause , pause . most of the pauses are brief , some last several seconds . i eventually took out the dvd , cleaned it , but it did n't help . i suffered through 50 minutes of this film , then gave up . vhs was a decent format . tape had problems , but nowhere near as bad as dvd , with all the skipping and scratching . ( and google `` dvd rot '' -- see what comes up . ) still , changing formats is a great way for studios to resell us movies we 'd already bought , so i guess it makes sense for them . i do n't know whether i got a bad copy of street law , or if this dvd is part of a bad batch , or how widespread the problem is . but beware
