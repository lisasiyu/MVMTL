no mention of wicca in product description - why ? why does n't amazon mention that this video talks about wicca in their review or in their product description ? i also looked at the video in a store , and there was no mention of wicca on the case . that 's important information to leave out . if it were there , consumers could decide for themselves whether or not it was an appropriate video to show their children .
