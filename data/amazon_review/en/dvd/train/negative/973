not for the half-hearted eurythmics follower like me ... i must admit that virtually as soon as i bought this dvd ( out of curiousity because many other reviewers are in the & quot ; got ta see them live & quot ; camp ) i wondered if i 'd done the right thing ; when i played it i so much wanted to justify my purchase but alas can not ; there is energy , yes , but little variety - all musicians apart from dave s are subordinate & amp ; the performances , to me , are formulaic ; i almost cut it off after the first 6 tracks but skipped forward to & quot ; walking on broken glass & quot ; & amp ; & quot ; there must be an angel & quot ; & amp ; , thankfully found some comfort in the familiarity of these & amp ; the ( few ) songs which followed . bottom line : fine for true fans but not for the half-hearted
