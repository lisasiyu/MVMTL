self-firm flat abs fast well the title seems to fit the dvd `` fast '' but in a different aspect , as far as time goes . i thought this was very boring and slow , but it was over in no time at all . it probably would be great for someone just beginning and has very little or no time at all to exercise and it does n't work up a sweat . it was very very easy to do and i 'm a beginner myself
