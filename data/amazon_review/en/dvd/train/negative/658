man , this movie sucks . do n't believe the hype . this movie sucks . nothing happened . the ghost of a boy and a lady showed up every now and then , then the movie ended . i 'm not one to usually complain about or laugh at cheap effects . i actually think that the so called low buget 1980s movies look a lot more realistic than todays cgi . but i just had to laugh at the sound that the ghosts made . i imediately reconized it as a sound i used to make with my mouth all the time as a wee lad
