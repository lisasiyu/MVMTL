one of worst movies ever made it is not giving way the ending of this movie to say that the writer seems to have forgeting the plot of movie half way through and started writing a differant one . personally i can not blame him . throw in some un funny anti and anti sementic jokes , ( note i am the most un pc person in world so if i am put off it says somthing ) and an apperance by larry king , and and you have everything wrong with american movie making . please note- jon lovitts character in the critic word have great time with this high budget turke
