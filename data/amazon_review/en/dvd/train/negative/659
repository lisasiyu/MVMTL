i 'm embarassed i am embarassed to admit that i saw this video several years ago ; i give it 2 stars . i suppose the film quality is excellent , but in my opinion , a waste of film to make this . the plot is forgettable , and , at the risk of offending those who like it , `` i spent two hours out of my life watching this , and ca n't get them back again for something constructive .
