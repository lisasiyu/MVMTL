worst be we own my son , husband , and i really do not like this dvd because ( unlike other baby einstein dvds ) this dvd is too focused on cheap looking computer animation . there are very few puppet scenes , and the ones they have are pretty quick and lack much depth . the music is pretty bad , too . i prefer the music of baby mozart or baby beethoven . this sounded synthetic and computer-generated , not `` real . '' i found this dvd to be boring and could n't keep my attention or that of my son . my son ( 15 months ) ca n't watch this entire dvd . he gets very bored and sick of the monotonous sign language instructions ( which take up most of the dvd and are pretty fast in pace ) . i was underwhelmed and wish i had n't purchased this dvd . it is not like previous be dvds . i suggest baby mcdonald , baby da vinci , or baby mozart to those who wish to purchase a be dvd .
