negative stars for this one this movie starts out with an incomplete back-story , 500 years before the main story . but , unless someone is well versed in the bible , or the torah , the viewer has no idea why this is relevant because the back-story just stops after a key moment . it jumps to the main story for a few minutes , then tries to back-fill questions left from the back-story with flashbacks and voice-overs , but it 's still not clear what is going on . the description says hadassah hid her religion , but it 's not as hidden as you 'd think it would be . over and over again , she and her uncle talk about being jews , the housekeeper calls them jews , their friends call them jews , and there are even more flashbacks to hadassah 's childhood showing how she grew up jewish . she even reads from a scroll of a biblical tale to children in the market . if this is how she hides her religion , i 'd hate to see what she 'd do to flaunt it . actress tiffany dupont tries to give hadassah a child-like wonderment of the world . she 's a teenager longing to explore her roots , and the world at large . this would go well in having teens relate to her , but the dialog gets in the way . the writers chose to keep with the same wording and phrases common to many translations of the bible . the complex dialog is spewed out , sometimes as quickly as possible , without any real inflection . this causal behavior coupled with formalized dialog is too much of a dichotomy to be believable . and , unfortunately , even the more seasoned actors stumble over the formalized wording , further distancing the viewer from the story . if you 're really into biblical stories , then maybe you 'd enjoy this , but if you 're looking for a quality film regardless of the topic , it 's best to look elsewhere . ( i could only endure a half-hour .
