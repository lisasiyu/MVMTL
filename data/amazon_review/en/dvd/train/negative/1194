i just did n't get it this movie seemed to vacillate between funny ha ha office bullsh*t and then really freaky stuff that made me cringe and want to retch . i do n't like that ; going back and forth and not knowing what they `` want '' from me . and i really did n't 'get ' the ending . i did n't buy the romance . the only thing i enjoyed about this whole movie was kevin spacey ; that 's it . just skip through the rest of the crap
