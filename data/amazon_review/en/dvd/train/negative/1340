disappointing i was expecting a college comedy with plenty of college girl t & a . but the t & a was minimal , only a couple of quick scenes . and the movie was only slightly entertaining . since the movie was n't very entertaining for me ( a male ) , and most of the stars of the movie are female ... and the males in the movie are portrayed as idiots ( fools ) , and the plot is mostly about girls trying to get into a sorority ... .i 'm thinking this movie must be a `` chick flick '' ... a movie for girls . guys will hope to see enough college girl nudity to be interesting , but they will be disappointed . some paris hilton fans may like the movie , but be sure to note that paris hilton does not get naked in this movie ( ... but a few other girls get topless ) . i would n't be surprised to see some girls disagreeing with my assumption that this movie is a `` chick flick '' ... maybe its just a little dull for everyone ... ( barely watchable )
