almost , but not quite . as a fan of the coen brothers i was very disappointed by this film because it was almost good . the snappy and perfectly timed dialogue they usually have never quite materializes here . the wonderful characters you would expect to find here are mostly hollow and not quite original or sharp . add to this the fact that the original is a classic and in no way needed to be remade and it 's a swing and a miss . this movie seems less like a coen brothers movie than it does a movie made by fans of theirs that were stealing from them in uninspired ways
