simply put : not funny while surfing the channels one night , i happen to stumble upon mind of mencia . i attempted to get into the show , and actually watched a few episodes , but barely got more then a slight chuckle . i usually love comedy central , but this effort by ned `` carlos mencia '' holness simply is n't funny . i 'm not going to go into detail about how he 's really honduran/german and not mexican , or that he 's been accused by several other comedians of stealing material , i 'll simply comment on what i saw . and what i saw simply lacked comedic value . he 's often compared to dave chappelle , but dave chappelle 's racial remarks are made in a very smart , interesting , and often unique manner , and chappelle show did n't need to be racist to be funny ( like the rick james skit ) mind of mencia is very formulaic and often breaks down into : white people do _________ , while mexicans do _________ . its just not funny
