how could anybody enjoy this ? `` problem child '' has made my top ten worst movies list . how could anybody enjoy it ? `` problem child '' paved the way for little monster movies . in its footsteps would come `` clifford , '' `` the good son '' and more recently , `` are we there yet ? '' in this genre , children are little sadistic monsters who stop just short of killing their adult supervisors and cackle maniacally . usually , these movies are billed as `` comedies . '' in this one , this kid could have a tea party with damien from `` the omen '' and samarra from `` the ring . '' he 's not funny , he 's not charming or cute ; he 's a scary little creature . plus , are we supposed to think it 's funny that his idol is a serial killer ? that he writes letters to him ? that the serial killer comes to visit and `` takes him away , '' therefore putting him in danger ? that the father proves himself at the end by battling the killer and rescuing the kid ? horrible , cringe-inducing stuff . the filmmakers should have had a long discussion before making `` problem child .
