... ... not good enough ! ! ! ... .. i did not like hardly a thing about this war picture , anthony mann or no anthony mann [ director ] ... robert ryan was superb being in command of a motley squad of straggler/soldiers ... even the macho aldo ray was a know-it-all who showed no fear whatso ever [ that included army officers also ] ... that 's alot of claptrap ... hip/hip/hooray for hollywood ... this stuff may have permeated us army cadres in the field [ and in hollywood studios ] but it could never have happen with a us marine squad of highly trained riflemen [ 13 marines ] ... nary any semblence of discipline nor any sense of mission showed amongst the enlisted men in this drab army movie ... it was a foregone conclusion that most of them would be kia by movies ' end ... i saw this movie in 1957 ; it never impressed me with what we , [ i ] saw and done in korea with my fleet marine force comrades in the field ... many decades later , i review it with even more snickering hysterics ... no way , gi ... no way ! ! ... .semper fidelis ... .ssgt chris sarno-usmc fm
