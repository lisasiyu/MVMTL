a so-so movie adapted from a not-so-good novel this is strictly a dvd production not good for the big screen . a very mediocre screenplay originated from a meidocre novel by one of the once-upon-a-time greatest novelists . sam elliot was a very bad casting choice , he 's way too old for this action movie , he looked so tired to move around in almost all the locations . and the on and on flash-backs were the worst and the oldest directing and editing technique to be used in this bad movie . the cia and the cia operatives also looked so lame , so stupid and so unconvincing , they 're just a bunch of wimps . the connection between cia and that bosnian mass murderer was also too contrite to be convinced easily . a brainless screenplay worse than the original bad novel .
