too bad i 'll have to forego ... ... ... .. the many reviews i have read of `` the merchant of venice '' make me thirst nearly unbearably to purchase this dvd . however , i can not , for it offers no english subtitles , which i need to get the most out of a movie . especially shakespeare , whose language is difficult enough to begin with . i have `` much ado about nothing '' which i adore & which does have subtitles . will look for others
