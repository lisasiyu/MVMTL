rip-off remembrance i know the title of this volume of wolf 's rain is `` recollections '' , but bandai has went a little overboard . i expect at least one or two episodes in an anime series to be a recap but here we have an entire dvd , 4 episodes of recycled material from past shows ! ! ! ! there is nothing new here . even the infamous last 2 episodes of evangelion did n't go so far as this and they were running out of money . what is the excuse here ? to pay 20 $ for an entire dvd of stuff i 've already seen . it 's almost like they were making one of those awful anime movies where an entire 26 episode series is squeezed into 2 hours . there should have been a warning on the dvd box that there is no new material contained in it . it makes me want to write to bandai and demand my money back . if you have been following wolf 's rain since the first volume , definately skip this volume . you 'll be wasting your money . i would recommend miami guns episode 2 , which parodies recap shows by having one after only one episode of the show .
