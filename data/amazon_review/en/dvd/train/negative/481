i 've tasted better , way better ... major disappointment . maynard 's head has swelled to magnificent proportions thus he forced his band-mates into this pile of dung just because he can . not only was this album/dvd completely rushed and way less-than-perfected , i found it odd that in a chat with maynard on october 29 , 2003 he stated the following regarding the 13th step , `` i 'm not thinking about that right now . i 'm on the delivery table crowning ... breathing hard ... delivering my new baby ... and you 're asking me if i 'm going to have another baby someday '' . but yet emotive was rushed to be released in time for 2004 elections . maybe mr. keenan should heed his own advice : `` you are always responsible for your own actions , so choose them wisely '' .
