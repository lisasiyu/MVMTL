revolting this movie is very difficult to watch after awhile . its about a psycho boss but its not funny at all . i did n't laugh through any of the movie . i love dark comedies like election , heathers , to die for , etc but this just did n't work for me . i hated it so much i returned it ( lied and said it was a gift ) . do n't even rent it horrendous
