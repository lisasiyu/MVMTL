very disappointed we were very disappointed with this bob the builder dvd . my children love bob the builder and own every video . we were excited to hear that a new one was coming out soon ( especially on dvd ) . however , it is not new ! every episode on this dvd is on the other videos ( or has been on the nick jr. show at least 6 months ago ) . i would have never thought they would release a new dvd/video without any new episodes . if this is your first bob the builder dvd/video , then i would recommend it . if you own many others , then do n't bother getting this one because you have already seen it
