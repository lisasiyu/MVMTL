i want 48 minutes of my life back this could quite possibly have been the worst movie i 've ever seen in my entire existence ! first off ... jim carrey should do everything in his power to have this movie no longer releaseed or accessable to the public . ( animals included ) this movie can be rented in the comedy section of a video store ... it should n't be there . the only laughs i had were me and other people laughing at me for my selection of a wasted night watching this movie . sure you may come back and say it was a student film ... but honestly , where the hell could he or she be a student at ! ! who would accept someone with such lack of talent and creativity . sure the girl was fat ... nbut that was n't here main problem . the acted like an idiot all the time and then allowed people to call her big j ! ! this is a complex written all over it . this is big j calling was always followed by some cheap yogi bear impresion ... once again retaining back to the fact that she 's fat and her rolemodel was a picnic basket stealing bear . jim carey did n't even entered this movie untill about 20 or so minutes into it . and just furtherd this movies down-hill spiral we call a waste of film . i was not impressed and do n't recommend this waste o time , film , and brain cells to anyone thing . even if no one is watching this movie in your house , please do n't leave it on in an empty living room where some small child or housepet could stumble blindly into the path of idiotic rays being dispersed from the tv screen . my cat died , while viewing this film . please heed my warning
