jennifer aniston saves the day ... .again ! along came polly is so silly and annoying but of course the lovely jennifer aniston makes this film almost worth while . i probably would have turned this movie off if it was n't for her . aniston has charisma so even in a crummy movie like this one , she tries to make an awkward situation somewhat ok. ben stiller is another story , he always picks the same , stereotypical role . i guess stiller thinks he is not worth a decent part . oh well , along came polly will not send me on a second viewing anytime soon . i recommend the good girl or reality bites instead
