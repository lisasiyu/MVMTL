not what was promised original review : i could never get the edition with the leather jacket as promised . after contacting amazon 3 times and sending back the same version 2 times without a leather jacket i gave up . even their customer service department said i would never get the correct selection . i guess what you see is n't always what you get . i 'm sure the actual movie is fine . i have n't opened it yet as i assume it is new and should n't have any scratches . maybe i should check that , too ! follow-up review : judy in customer service called me and said she made a special effort to track down a copy of grease in a leather jacket for me and i could send them back the old one in exchange . she was very kind and i give her kudos for being so involved . as promised , i got my grease in the leather jacket and my husband is impressed with his gift ! i would give this 5 stars now , but it would n't let me change it .
