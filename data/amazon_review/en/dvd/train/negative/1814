scooby-dud ! loud , obnoxious and generally unfunny live-action adaption of the hanna-barbera cartoon . after watching this film i realized that the legendary 80 's mega-flop `` howard the duck '' was almost twenty years ahead of its time . there 's very little difference between scooby-doo ( and most of the other current films of this type ) and that classic bomb ! perhaps the only difference is that today this garbage is actually successful and is even considered `` sequel worthy '' . also , just to be fair to howard the duck , at least that movie had the visual appeal of lea thompson . if your idea of fun is bombastic , poorly produced special effects , a crappy modern soundtrack and a plethora of booger and fart jokes then this is the film for you ! certainly worth checking out if you 're a fan of the scooby-doo character , but just be prepared to end up wanting two hours of your life back ! the sequel deserves the exact same review . -j
