the only things preserved are a few names as far as a shoot-um-up with the obligatory car chase goes , this movie did it quite well . and like many of the other `` 1984 '' machine churned out films for the proletariat , the title and a few names bear the only resemblance to the ludlum story . quite a few of the characters that give this story depth and mystery are left out of the movie completely . now let 's not compare this quickie in shoot-up land with the well thought out book `` the bourne identity '' by robert ludlum or the much better portrait of the story in the mini-series `` the bourne identity '' ( 1988 ) starring richard chamberlain and jaclyn smith ; then we can enjoy what is left . a sailor on a fishing trawler spots a human body in the water . after retrieving it we find it is alive . helping this stranger back from the near dead we find a couple of bullet holes and a mysterious capsule under his skin . the capsule displays what the fisherman recognizes immediately as a swiss bank account . the man can not remember who he is . now we follow along with his journey to switzerland and find out if he will recover . in the mean time someone is out to kill him . why ?
