what is the hype ? ? ? this movie was so extremely boaring . i made it to the part where he said , `` i think i 'm pregnant , '' then turned it off . get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say , `` i think i 'm pregnant . '' i understand the story line completely , after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way , shape , and form . this film deserves below a star , it has no suspence , no action , no terror , no real mystery , just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film ... i did n't care enough to finish it
