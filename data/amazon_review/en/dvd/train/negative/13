watch the original an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful & quot ; eat drink man woman & quot ; . frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first.. i just finished watching eat drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago . anyway , i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup , eat drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me . if you have n't seen either , see the better of the two ( exact same stories ) : eat drink man woman
