just say no , cuz ! this movie provides ample proof that lsd usage does affect the minds of the unborn . grateful dead legend jerry garcia 's daughter made this amateurish home video . while the topic of genetically modified foods is interesting , this video comes off as terribly one-sided hatchet job on the biotech industry and u.s. agriculture , in general . monsanto is the main target of this film 's attacks , but no one from the company is ever allowed to respond to the claims that it is trying to monopolize the pesticide and seed industries by buying up potential competitors and registering for patents on thousands of genetically engineered plant products . instead , we 're treated to the overzealous opinions of a few blowhards who do n't have any idea of how to encourage research , development , and innovation in agriculture . the vague term of `` biodiversity '' is mentioned as some kind of virtue , but no explains its benefits . actually , everyone is allowed to whine in this movie , from farmers to activists , but no one is ever allowed to respond to attacks . in one sequence , a farmer criticizes monsanto . in another sequence , the u.s. government is criticized for subsidizing farmers ( nevermind that every major industrial power subsidizes its farmers ) . why not ask the farmer if he 's dependent on government handouts , and how he justifies such subsidies ? why should farmers be immune to criticism ? please , let 's get into the mix a little bit , and get to the bottom of these controveries !
