i walked out of the theater on this flick ... . i was a sophomore in hs and went to this cartoon with my cousins , what a mistake ! i walked out and sat in the car till it was over . it was awful . i think it is sick that even grown ups think this is so amusing to watch cartoon characters have sex . i would n't even rate it a `` 1 '' star . more like zero stars
