well , it could have been worse . really . bay of blood ( mario bava , 1971 ) it amuses me that mario bava himself hated this movie . the first thing i thought after it was over was `` man , that was miles better than black sunday . '' it 's still not worth rewatching , but if you 've steered clear of bava after watching the borefest that was black sunday , this may entice you to at least give him another try . the plot , what little of it there is , is this ; a husband kills his wife in order to get his hands on some land that includes a private lake ( the bay of the title ) . her daughter stages a suicide , so she can run around uninhibited by family obligations trying to get said bay back with a couple of hired hands with less than pristine motives themselves . a bunch of partying kids happens on the scene completely by accident . complications ensue . it 's hopelessly entangled in its own plot , despite that plot not being in any way complex . it throws in a good deal of gratuitous violence and not nearly enough gratuitous nudity ( but some , at least , courtesy the lovely softcore actress brigitte skay ) , foreshadowing just about every silly slasher film to come . basically , it 's mindless fun . dario argento did it far better a few years later with profondo rosso ; see that instead . *
