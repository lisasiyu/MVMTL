technical problems render this oater virtually unwatchable this undistinguished oater is made much worse by technical problems . it is n't a bad little western , and the two lead roles are played competently by vera miles , whose most famous role was laurie jorgensen in `` the searchers , '' and sam elliott , who was born to make westerns . it had a good plot and some beautiful desert locations . unfortunately , the film was not well shot . none -- and i mean not one -- of the interior scenes is adequately lighted ; you can barely make out dark shadows moving around against a black background . the scenes in the cactus jail , which are key and set up the movie , might as well be taking place in a cave without even a candle for light . then there 's the dvd which is full-frame and was mastered from an extremely distressed print of the film . the dvd is blurry and shows every scratch , spot , and speck of dirt that 33 years of obscurity could inflict on the print . too bad . miles and elliott deserved better . frankly , because of the technical issues , the film is probably not worth wasting 90 minutes on .
