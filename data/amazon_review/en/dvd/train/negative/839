stealth fighter oh my god , i ca n't believe they actually released this movie onto video ! ... i had the dreadful misfortune of actually watching this film ... .thank god it was on hbo ( i actually thought it was an hbo made-for-tv movie ) ... anyways , this movie was sooo bad , i 'm surprised that the air force even allowed their aircraft to be photographed for this movie..seriously..there 's no plot and horrendous acting , but what can you expect from a movie with the title & quot ; stealth fighter & quot ; ? besides that , the movie is bad almost to the point of being funny ... .like the ending , i wo n't ruin it or anything ( would n't that be bad ! ) ... ... just do n't bend over to pick up your beer ( probably # 12 by that point in the movie ) because you might miss the whole ending ... it 's over that quick ! one example of why this movie stinks so bad : ice-t walks onto an airforce base ... decides to meander over to a hanger , knocks down a couple of & lt ; good & gt ; guys that look like offensive-tackle-types ... then just jumps into a stealth fighter ( that happens to have the keys in it , and is fully gassed up ) ... and flies away non-chalantly ... .and he does n't even rap ! anyways , might be good if you 're inebriated and need a good laugh ... .otherwise , avoid this like a port-a-potty at a buffet concert ... like my roommate says of this movie in the same voice as that guy from the simpsons , & quot ; worst ... ..movie ... ... ever ! & quot
