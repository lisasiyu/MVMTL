unnecessary repeat who 's idea was it to have victor garber as daddy warbucks ? okay he is a good actor , but once they had shaved his head , did they not see how freakishly enormal it was ? or the shine ? the original annie was awesome , it was perfect , it didnt need a cheesy remake in the 90's.the new annie doesnt even fit the bill , no red curly hair , which wasnt the original movies idea , it was based on the cartoon . my niece saw this one first , and then the original , and she loves the original even though she saw it second , she said the new one isnt `` as fun to watch '' and i agree
