do n't get me wrong ... ... i 'm a huge john wayne fan , but this movie has some serious shortcomings , including some of the acting by the cast and portrayals that , while acceptable at the time , are not so well received today . i wo n't knock john wayne 's acting , however , because he performed it as only john wayne could . but some of the other acting was downright daffy , like when the singing eddie powers ( william frawley ) was shot by the sniper and his singing wound down as though the sniper missed him and hit a nearby phonograph machine . ... the fighting seabees was n't a totally bad movie , and i thought the formation of the seabees ( if this movie is accurate ) was very interesting . but some refinement and a small dose of reality would have made it much better
