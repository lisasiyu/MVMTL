all humans must go this is a `` horror '' movie in the sense that it is incredibly grating and all the people in it act like total garbage . i do n't mean the acting is garbage , though it is . i mean that all the characters in the movie are complete human garbage , such as make you want to start your own special death camp just to get rid of them . if the aim of the movie was to turn the viewer into a one-man murder wave , then ... bingo . i am locked and loaded and ready to ratatatatatatatattat ... . blow away the cast
