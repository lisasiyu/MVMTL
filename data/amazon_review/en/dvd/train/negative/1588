you must be joking . that was what i said quite loudly the night i went to the movies to see this . the story portrayed on film does not even come close to the story in the book . the author , i am certain would have not approved with what has been done with her work . unfortunately she was already deceased and had no control over it . i know some of you are saying how could that be , her books are still being published . they use her name for the books , but she has not written a book since the sequel to `` heaven '' , which she did n't even complete herslelf . other than the performance of louise flethcer this movie is a waste of film .
