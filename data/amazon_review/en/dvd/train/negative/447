how did this happen ? i was shocked when i saw the episodes of the second season . i would say the first season was one of the best things to be aired on tv ever . how come they just throw all that down the drain ? you really do n't know what to think during the episodes . `` is it a comedy ? oh , look at at satan and his friends having a chat.am i supposed to laugh or amuse myself ? and now , is it a serious episode ? '' not to mention the lack of darkness so well conveyed by frank black in the 1st season . to sum up , the second season left a lot to be desired . the only thing i can do now is re-watch season one .
