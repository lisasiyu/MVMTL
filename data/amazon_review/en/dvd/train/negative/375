poor release of movie i found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time . it 's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning . the ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion . denzel washington did a great job playing the detective and john goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted . my recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money . buy somthing that has a good plot . d- is my ratin
