content weak but video is interesting abc dives into the kennedy killing with this video showing how the lone-nut oswald did the killing alone , just as the warren commission said he did . the main focus of the video seems to be to show why all of the conspiracy-theory people are mistaken and misled . unfortunately , the content is sufficiently weak that the video 's ability to persuade will be limited to those who are completely unfamiliar with the facts . it 's easy to believe in the lone-nut theory of the killing as long as you believe things like : 1 ) the parkland hospital doctors in the er who had seen many bullet wounds were mistaken about seeing an entry wound on the front of kennedy 's neck , an exit wound on the back of his head , and the absence of the grotesque wound on the right side of kennedy 's head seen on the zapruder film , 2 ) the autopsy accurately identified the type and location of kennedy 's wounds , 3 ) the second bullet fired by lone-nut oswald passed through kennedy 's body , through connally 's body , and lodged in connally 's leg , later to fall out on the stretcher in good condition and morph from the pointed shape identified by the finder to the rounded shape found by the warren commission , 4 ) the eyewitnesses and police at the scene when the shooting occurred were mistaken about the number of shots they heard , hearing shots originate from the grassy knoll , and seeing the limousine momentarily stop , 5 ) oswald fired three shots with a bolt-action rifle in 6 seconds and was able to fire down at a target moving away from him and up an incline while hitting with two shots , 6 ) oswald decided not to fire when the kennedy limousine was coming towards him but waited until after it had made the turn directly in front of him , had traveled several hundred yards , and was moving away , 7 ) oswald was able to hide his rifle and race down the stairs from the 6th floor to the 2nd floor lunchroom in 90 seconds without even breathing hard and then be questioned and released by an extremely suspicious police officer who had just raced into the building after hearing the shots , 8 ) fire a bolt-action rifle 3 times without having any gunsmoke residue on his cheek to be detected by a 'paraffin ' test given hours later by the dallas pd , and 9 ) a guy just happened to be pumping an opened umbrella up and down on a sunny day at the exact spot of the shooting , when the president came driving by . if none of these things are a stretch , then you will find abc 's work highly persuasive . otherwise , you will start to wonder why abc is cranking out this kind of stuff and ... perhaps ... even become a conspiracy nut . even if you do lean towards the conspiracy point of view , though , you will find this video well-produced and interesting .
