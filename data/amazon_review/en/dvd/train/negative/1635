believe the bad reviews as other people said before me , i could n't be a bigger will ferrell fan . he 's incredible . but i ca n't say the same for the writers of some snl sketches or the people who choose what is put on these dvds . i thought his first best of dvd was pretty good ( not great , but what can you do ) . as far as the second dvd , it 's almost like nbc or whoever felt like playing a practical joke on the buying audience . none of will 's popular recurring characters showed up , and in the rare instance that they were included ( janet reno , the lover , actor 's studio ) , it was like the worst sketch was chosen . again , will is great , but this dvd is not . please believe the customer reviews . save your $ 13 and buy old school or elf
