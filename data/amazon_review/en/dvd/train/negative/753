do not buy the 3d version ... less than 15 mins total 3d i wish i came here first before allowing my 5 yr old daughter to save and buy this movie , we own the original ( non 3d version ) and she knew the 3d version was the same movie but was excited about the 3d aspect and the commercial rums every 15 mins here so she asked if she could get it . we made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half , ( at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart ) , finally got up the money to go buy the 3d version , got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn , mom dad daughter , then we realized bibble pops on and says take glasses off after a few mins of intro 3d ? 15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses on again etc , overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3d and most of it not in parts you would even want to see 3d action ... needless to say having already bought the first release , even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3d feature , it falls short bigtime due to the lack of 3d in the movie . buy the original it 's better , and it is a good movie ! just having kids take off the 3d glasses 5+ times per showing ( expecting them to hold them i guess ? ) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3d segments is just asking for broken paper 3d glasses and leads to an overall dud of a supposed 3d release
