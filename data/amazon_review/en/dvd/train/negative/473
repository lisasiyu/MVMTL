the perfect prescription for insomnia normally i love documentaries . i 've watched hundreds of them and with one exception i have loved them all . however , outfoxed is the single most boring film i have ever seen . a relentless rant against rupert murdoch 's cable news station , this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with fox news , but i can not imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in fox news to remain awake while watching this movie . watching outfoxed makes me realize what a genius michael moore is . whether you love him or hate him , whether you agree with him or not , you have to admit his films are entertaining . this film , however , is a major bore . - regina mcmenami
