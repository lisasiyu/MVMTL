do n't see what the hype was all about i was 4 years old when this movie was released , but i vividly remember irene cara 's smash song of the same name in 1980 ( especially the chorus of , `` fame , i 'm gon na live forever '' ) and , after so many years , i was really looking forward to a great movie and boy was i disappointed . i was thoroughly bored during the first half-hour . the audition sequence should have been cut down by half the time because it got boring after 15 minutes . after this painful sequence , the movie finally gets underway . i tried to stick with the movie for the next hour and could n't do it . i appreciated what the teachers had to say about the performing arts ( it is hard work - everybody 's an actor , dancer , and/or musician but only a very small percentage actually make a living doing it ) , and i definitely appreciated the part about having to keep up your academic studies while pursuing a career in entertainment , but the movie just did n't flow for me . perhaps it would have to do with the fact that i 'm not one of those people who is n't proclaiming to anyone who 'll listen that i 'm an `` actress '' ( and who rolls their eyes at those people who do ) . besides the slow pace of the story , `` fame '' is very dated . the off-the-shoulder top ( that became the rage of the early-80s due to cara 's video ) and the depressed backdrop of the decaying inner city that characterized that `` wonderful '' decade known as the 1980s gives a potential viewer the incentive to stay away from this movie . i do n't get the hype about this film at all . - donna di giacom
