the mothman travesty three problems with this film : 1 . pacing - the film 's pacing does n't vary . it 's very boring . as a matter of fact , this would n't be a problem if the film were much more tense ( e.g. , `` speed '' ) , however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed . 2 . effects - too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions , and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging . the scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling `` horror '' scenes . furthermore , they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film 's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole . the upshot : the film relies too heavily on the art of editing , to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting . 3 . triviality - the plot 's conclusion quails in the face of the `` so what ? '' question . the viewer is left with a sense of , `` i sat through the film for that ? '' in light of points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake . do n't waste your life . alon
