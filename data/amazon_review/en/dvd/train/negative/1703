stan and john create surface tension this dvd first caught my eye with high expectations and a low price . the price turned out to be too much . stan lee and john buscema are two of the greatest comic book creators that have ever lived , but this dvd just is n't good enough to meet their standards . it offers much in the way of comic book jargon , but displays each business element very poorly . the main focus of this `` visual '' video is verbal instruction . there is a very limited amount of important hands-on drawing , barely even enough to teach a learning artist anything . i think that how to draw comics the marvel way could have been done a lot better and should offer a great deal more . unless you are an avid comic book fan , i do not recommend purchasing this dvd . and , even if you are , i would give it some serious thought
