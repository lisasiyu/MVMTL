bronson is suave , but what happened to j. lee ? not a great film by any means , but mildly diverting . however , all credibility is lost in one key scene . j. lee thompson , director of guns of navarone and the original cape fear is amazing example of a man whose considerble skills deteriorated over time . this one is ok , but he degernerated even further in his later collaborations with bronson . the film lost it for me during a scene where the assorted characters are making an exchange of goods in a drive-in movie . the marquee says something like `` western double feature '' and if you look at the screen , it 's the same 20 second loop of a cattle stampede . so the other moviegoers drove in not knowing the names of the movies they were seeing and were staring at the same 20 seconds of film run over and over again . i know from fond memories that drive-ins were make-out hangouts back in the day and we did n't always focus on the movie , but this is ridiculous
