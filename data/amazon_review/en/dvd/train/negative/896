an awful adaptation the costumes were great ... .but this movie did no justice to the novel . `` cousin bette '' the novel is excellent , `` cousin bette '' the movie , is dreadful . i understand some changes are necessary when a novel is adapted into a movie , but these changes were awful and they took something very important ( the baroness ) away from the story ... if you have n't read the novel , you will probably find this movie to be decent . if you have read the novel , be prepared to be very disappointed
