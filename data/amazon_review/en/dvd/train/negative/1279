bad i 've watched most of segal 's films , and i own several as well . but this film is one of the worst films i 've seen in the last ten years . excepting for a chance to look at jacqueline lord ( a catherine zeta jones look , act , and dress alike ) for a little while , and her acting was n't very good most of the time , there are no redeeming aspects to this film . for a film in the action genre , it consists of all bad elements . the plot actually had potential , except the dialog is on the level of a bad high school film . segal is so over-weight that you can tell he 's struggling to do even the most basic martial arts sequences . unless he can lose weight and get into shape , this is the last film of his i 'll spend any time watching . unfortunately , the sets , the action , the dialog , the acting , the directing , and so forth , are all between the d+ to c levels of quality . i 'd rather have seen a corny kung fu movie . at least there would have been some excuse for so many bad elements in one film . avoid this film totally
