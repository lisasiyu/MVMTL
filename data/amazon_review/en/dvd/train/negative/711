stunning visuals , dismal premise and narration . visuals are stunning , editing is superb - so if you need a visual guide to the bible , this is pretty good . unfortunately , that is where the good ends . bruce feiler sets out on a quest to visit all the biblical landmarks of its first five books , but the trip has an inherent weakness - mr. feiler is a skeptic . he is taking a journey of faith but rationalizes each and every step he takes . for example , ascending the mt . ararat , where the bible says the ark of noah rested ; he wonders where all the waters would have come from in the first place . he wonders - melting ice-caps ? in other words , bruce feiler is looking for a rational explanation for the great flood ! if bruce feiler believes that there was a garden of eden as the bible says ( his very first stop ) , then he must also believe that god made the heavens and the earth , as the bible says ! if he can create the heavens and the earth by the word of his mouth , he can also perform miracles . you can not pick and choose what you believe based on your so-called rationality - either the bible is true in its entirety , or it is not . if it is not true , then it does not need bruce feiler 's help to prop up its so-called `` stories '' . this aspect of bruce feiler journey is oft repeated - and very perplexing . why set out on such a journey if you do not believe your guidebook ? more examples ? bruce feiler suggest that since the sinai wilderness could not support the number of people the bible says crossed over from egypt , therefore the numbers must be wrong . how about the manna being nothing but the gum of some wilderness tree in sinai ? i could go on ... .but you get the point . after a while , this becomes very annoying . if you are a believer , this is not for you . i would not recommend it for my children .
