not exactly the `` the texas chainsaw massacre '' . after seeing the overhyped `` american gothic '' , i must say that i came away disappointed . what you have here is a movie that was constructed in the mold of the original `` the texas chainsaw massacre '' where you have some unsuspecting people coming up on a crazed homicidal family . unfortunately , the family really comes off looking goofy and silly more than dangerous and deadly . i would certainly rather come upon ma and pa 's family than leatherface and his family if you know what i mean . `` american gothic '' does a decent job of painting a crazy family portrait for sure , but ma , pa and company just do not exactly strike fear in the viewer 's heart ... they just are not that formidable as far as their prowess as horror movie villains . the kills are not too bad , but certainly are not anything to write home about . the acting is okay and production values are not too bad for a movie of this nature . i just did not like the way that ma and pa 's family came across to the viewer ... they come across more weird than horrifying , more eccentric than anything else and not exactly dangerous . do n't get me wrong ... obviously , they killed some people , but i was not convinced in the manner in which this was done or in the family 's disposition as brutal killers . also , i felt that the ending was rather weak and very predictable . i guess they just do not make them like they used to anymore . in short , the way i look at `` american gothic '' is that if the original `` texas chainsaw massacre '' is a five stars horror movie , then this movie , comparatively speaking , is certainly worth no more than one star ... it is what it is folks !
