cliche ridden ... i like dennis hopper and love frederick forrest . neither of them are bad considering the atrocious dialogue and tired premise that they have to work with . they seem to be rolling their eyes at each other as they speak their lines . sad to see such great talents wasted in a film filled with gratuitous violence and terrible `` pop psychology '' dialogue . was there a point to this film
