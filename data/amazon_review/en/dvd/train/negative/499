great viewing ! even if you are not a big sci-fi fan , you will still enjoy dark angel-the complete first season . besides having an impressive plot concept , the first season of the show gave us a look at some interesting personal interaction between believable characters . i liked the second season for the way it developed the story line , but the first season was better done over all . whether or not you like science fiction , you will get hours of enjoyment out of this box set of the first season of dark angel .
