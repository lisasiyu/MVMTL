edited i was disappointed in this product as it had been edited from the tv version i had originally seen . i did n't realize the dvd was being offered by a 'family values ' group . although the original version was barely pg , the editied version is now definitively g. several lines of dialogue between the 2 main adult characters were removed and an early scene which defined what kind of man the main character was has also been removed . it 's still a good movie and if you have n't seen the original , you probably wo n't care . personally , i dropped off the dvd at the salvation army and just kept my video-taped off the tv version - commercials and all . for me , the interaction between the 2 main adult characters was what had made the movie worth $ 25 ( with shipping ) , so losing that was a big disappointment for me . for me , it was a waste of money . if you have kids , though , it would probably be a good buy
