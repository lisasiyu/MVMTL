no subtitles and no closed captions ? ! why ? ! we discovered that this dvd of mission impossible - the complete first season will not provide subtitles and no closed captions . 1960 's tv mission impossible was my favorite tv show of all time . we are hearing impaired ( both deaf and hard of hearing ) and we want to see what they said from this legendary tv classic show . we survived and endured through hearing impaired discriminations , prejudice and bigotry such as audism . please do n't buy this dvd without subtitles and no closed captions because they deliberately copied from tv screen show to video without mastering of high-digital video techniques such as coloring , subtitles , etc . paramount home video company often made cheap and flawed dvd video in order to boost their profit while lower the video quality . you will be deeply disappointed when you see this dvd of `` mission impossible - the complete first season '' .
