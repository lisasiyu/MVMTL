no information , no pictures the film shows no action , except a disgusting performance of cutting apart a dead body , and you ask yourself , in what relation to the subject of the film this stands . ( sorry , forgot the 3-second-sceen of a naked young man ) just the head of 17-year-old lads , who wonder why they got infected , when they work as prostitute , explaning in detail what they are to do in this job and where you can find them in prag . ( like advertising ) you are provided with not the least background information about their education , why they left their home town , why they have no normal job . i would wonder what politics think and do about the youth in the new ec-country , what young people get told about the danger of deceases at school , and what other chances they have in life
