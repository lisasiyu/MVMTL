bad , just plain bad . spoilers ahead : i am not hard to please when it comes to horror movies , and totally enjoy a good b flick . but i have to say that this one was just terrible . there 's really no plot and even though you expect the charaters to do some silly stuff like go into creepy houses or whatever , i just could n't believe how stupid the main character really was ! ! how do you continue to hang out at that rest stop when the guy keeps coming back to mess with you ? i mean come on ! ! ! breaking into the rangers office on site , no less , and getting drunk ... all the while waiting for the phycho to come back and have another go at her ? then missing every possible opportunity to kill the psycho . was no one else shouting at the screen `` grab the cop 's gun and shoot the psycho ! '' as they watched him stroll by them to tow his motorbike . and running infront of the truck , in the headlights ... there was forest all around her and she never once went and hid , just hung out inside that disgusting bathroom . a sitting duck that deserved to be put out of it 's misery in my opinion . no , it was simply unbelievable and i was relieved when the credits rolled . so glad i did n't actually pay the rental fee on this one
