not recommended fields passport video , a north hollywood , ca , outfit , in their search for quality , match that other outfit , alpha video , for getting their hands on old , beat-up , third or fourth generation 8mm prints of films . the sound track is fixed , but the picture is dreadful , not remastered or brought up to date at all , which , with our technical equipment is possible ! they have simply put these very old junk prints on dvd . the price is high for this mess . there ought to be a law against putting out this kind of quality on dvd , i wo n't put the word for it here -- i 'll leave that to george carlin -- but ! do n't buy it
