i 'm quite dissapointed in this movie a princess and 8 samurais battle the hikima clan . the movie has some good swordfights , but the movie 's also too long , too slow moving at times , and it 's just a trial to sit through at times ! not to mention , the dubbing is horrendous . martial arts fans should skip this one . there 's much better movies out there than this
