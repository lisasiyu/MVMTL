huh ? are you kidding me -- the boy in the plastic bubble falls in love with this girl who wanted nothing to do with him until she went skating and hit her head on a nice outdoor patio set that i swear came from home depot . sure , i should be more concerned about who the stumkopf was who put lawn and garden itmes in the middle of a skating rink , i just wish that the skating chick who do perform a perfect hamil camel in front of ten thousand screaming fans could act her way our of a triple sow-cow . besideds , did n't she play a dumb blonde skater in a james bond movie ? wow what a stretch ! and could n't someone on that balcony have screamed `` hey , dummy , watch out for the chiminea ! '' anyway this movie made me wish i was blind ! skip it and every movie with the tag line -- starring robbie benson
