disney needs to get it together ! for months , disney advertised this as a 2-disc special edition dvd . but at the last minute , that second disc mysteriously disappeared . why ? this is false advertising , and if i had my way , disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands . it 's unfair to force people who really want a 2-disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the uk and to those of us who do n't own a region-free player . they did this same crap to alice in wonderland , but the other way around . uk lost a disc that we have , and paramount and fox have done this to us fans of titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the us , but not in the uk , and giving fans in the us a 3-disc edition . i do n't understand why these movie companies ca n't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world . unfortunately , i have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a `` special edition '' dvd . i do not appreciate being lied to . i still love disney movies as well as the excellent dvd editions , when disney actually releases the product they 've advertised for months , and i will continue to buy the quality dvd releases , but i do not enjoy false advertisement
