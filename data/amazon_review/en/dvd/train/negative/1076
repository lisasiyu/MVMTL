dolph lundgren 's version of `` rambo '' i think this was one of dolph 's better movies . it does a pretty good job of representing the factions in angola . it has a solid plot . red scorpion does what its supposed to do , which is make dolph the savior of the people in angola while showing off his body . its unrealistic that one man is going to come along and single handedly end a war thats been going on for years ( especially in africa ) but thats why its only a movie .
