you can see the jokes coming a mile away zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ! my friend felt i needed to see this film , so he lent it to me . i had never seen it before and after 15 minutes i was telling my wife who was watching with me , what was about to happen next . the jokes are so old and tired i could n't believe they were using them ! i would rather watch the three stooges ( not that there is anything wrong with that ! ) at least the stooges are really old classic shorts that were making history . the comparison to the stooges is that the jokes in this movies are as old as the jokes in the stooges shorts . this movie just is n't very good and is n't very funny unless you think a person slipping on a banana peel or a pie in the face is funny ? ... hee hee hee haw haw ! ! !
