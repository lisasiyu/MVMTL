not for young kids i saw this movie a long time ago and had forgotten all but the basic plot . i recently purchased the dvd thinking it would be a fun movie for my younger kids ( 9 , 8 , and 6 ) to watch . also , it was rated `` pg '' so i thought it would be pretty safe . i was wrong . while the plot is innocent enough , the language was atrocious . i could n't believe this thing was rated pg and not at least pg-13 . be advised that if you do n't want your kids to hear a lot of cursing throughout a movie , then this is not for you
