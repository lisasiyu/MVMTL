would not recommend i own several real wheels movies and thought i would give this one a shot . i found the picture quality to be less than i expected and the footage seemed out of date . the narration was dull and boring , and the children 's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying . i would recommend any of the real wheels series instead of this - they never fail to please my 3 1/2 year old truck lover
