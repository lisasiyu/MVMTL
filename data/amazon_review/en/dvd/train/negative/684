can i go lower than 1 star ? dear amazon , do n't ever recommend any grateful dead to me ever ! i consider it an insult to my undeniably good taste in music and movies and the like . i tried to step outside myself and tried to understand why this `` band '' is so goddamn popular , and i still gladly do n't get it . the worst part is i saw stupid jerry on some documentary on ifc and i enjoyed what he was playing , but this grateful dead ? they 're boring ! not mellow , boring ! ! their is a difference
