it had some good moments , but was mostly boring ... .. i am a sci-fi / space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley . the cast was solid , the director has talent , and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well ... right ? nope . this was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense . the formula kept repeating over and over : something goes wrong + houston advises + astronauts do something = all is well . lather , rinse , repeat . boring , very boring . i never once flet any real tension except for the initial `` problem '' which obviously was not that bad because everything went well in the end . the problem is that all of the `` issues '' the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly . rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked ... . it was just yeah , attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be ok . i never felt that the astronauts were really threatened , maybe a few times , but only for a minute or two . some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting ... . how so i must ask ? nothing really happened . it was not emotional at all since the `` struggles '' of the men were so poorly portrayed . to each his own i guess , but 4 1/2 stars ? geeez , just because tom hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks ! the family interactions were pretty standard : crying wife , kids asking questions , annoying media attention , etc , etc . yeah , i could feel for the characters to some extent , but again , this movie needed a lot more real tension and panic to be meaningful . i will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool , so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and star-trekkish special effects . too bad , i had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored . not recommended
