beautiful and unique , but oddly frustrating dancing on dangerous ground is best described as a ballet expressed through the medium of irish dance . the costuming is modern and the acts form a very cohesive story ( much more so than riverdance ) , but the superposition of romance , tragedy , and war on a dance invented for celebration seems ... contradictory at best . the performance is technically excellent , and for some , the military scenes alone will make the dvd worth it . but the irish legend - a tale of a first officer and a queen who betray their king not unlike lancelot and guinevere - has griana truncating her forms so as not to bounce too much during her lament , and both leads trying to express longing without breaking irish posture during their romance . in that sense , watching dancing on dangerous ground is kind of like admiring a painting of the sunset over a tropical beach done in glorious black and white . even if you think black and white photography is beautiful , and love sunsets and the tropics , you end up wishing that the painter had chosen to change either the subject , or the medium . the one place where medium and subject do work well is in the military scenes , where irish precision is put to amazing use ; then the watcher can feel the rhythm and the power conveyed , even through the tv screen . but in the scenes in between , i found myself craving a no-hold-barred energetic number that expressed the joy of irish dance ( like the ones which made riverdance famous ) , and wishing for the full upper-body expression of a ballet during some oddly stilted during laments and romantic scenes . as an irish dance piece it 's well executed , and as a ballet the costuming is inventive and the music beautiful , but there 's an odd quality to watching it . sometimes it gives the impression of muted color , sometimes of undersold majesty , but always there 's the feel that the passion , while *almost* there , is somehow still missing .
