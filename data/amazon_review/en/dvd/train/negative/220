morvern callar : requiem for a plot the pretentious film goer has never had a greater ally than lynne ramsay 's morvern callar . what is little more than a bland stew of typically successful indy film techniques ( hand-held shot , character-based , amoral , unique , hip , naked ) becomes an immenitely defensible , but truly awful film . to merely skim the surface : why morvern is touted as a study of progress , liberation , or self-discovery is dificult to see when both the plot and character remain static throughout the film ; indeed the initial party scene and lingering final shot seem to echo each other in a way which makes the beautiful cinemotography seem little more than a thoroughly convincing blue screen selected to flash in time with a cautiously hip soundtrack . although other indy film goers may crucify the non-believers , this sort of movie is equally disgusting as the bloated star-powered behemoth that has equally little depth of thought or genuine vision . that sort , however , is only after our money . morvern caller is after something much more dangerous : our admiration . for more information on lynne ramsay 's film , see : `` no skin off my nose , '' a succesful , art-house play prominately featured in the fountainhead .
