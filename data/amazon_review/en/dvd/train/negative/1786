just plain horrible i saw this with an open mind , as some modern remakes have been pretty good . this was not one of them . other than the title and number of children , this bore absolutely no resemblance to either the original with henry fonda and lucille ball , or the book it was based on ( who gets the drumstick ? -- helen beardsley ) . the main theme of this movie seemed to be `` how stupid can we make our parents look '' . if you are going to remake a movie , try to make it better , rather than just trying to capitalize on the earlier movie 's name and popularity
