i give it zero stars complaining , whinning , mumbling , beer drinking , bathtub soaking , unattractive alison and her overgrown , teenage hairstyled , beer drinking kid of a husband and their apy middle daughter . the most horrible series i 've seen on tv , in the end alison seems to `` solve '' whatever the problem is but it 's not worth the watch . no one in my family enjoyes this show
