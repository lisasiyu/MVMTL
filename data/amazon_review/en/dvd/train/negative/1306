wrecked movie ! why oh why is this in pan and scan only . this is a 2.35:1 framed movie and the well balanced and well composed cinematography is completely ruined on this dvd . about half the movie is missing . i love joshua tree but i wo n't buy this dvd . artisan must understand this simply wo n't do . sadly , the only widescreen version out there is the japanese laserdisc . and that 's long out of print
