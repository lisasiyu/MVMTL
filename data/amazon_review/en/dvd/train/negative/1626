the death of jaws who wrote this movie ? that is the first thing i had to ask myself after watching this movie a couple of months ago . oddly enough , this movie was one of my favorite `` scary '' films to watch as a little boy ... but , as an adult , wow ... this is just bad . the original jaws is a classic peice of film history and the second , although not as deep or well paced , is still a great film with a fairly well written plotline . this movie , on the other hand , is like being tortured by a psychopathic shark-lover ... at sea world ! who would ever think to incorporate sea world into the jaws franchise ? ? ? seriously , it was just a horrible idea ! the whole , `` mother shark lost her baby shark '' scenario is just weird ... i do n't even think that shark 's raise there `` pups '' once they are born ... they just swim away . not that this is that much different than the plot in jaws 2 , where a `` relative '' shark of the first jaws decides to go after cheif brody and his kids ... cheesy , but still , more fun and overall a better storyline . this movie trods along at a slow pace and the 3-d graphics add a overly grainy , aged look to the film . the acting is horrendous . dennis quaid is ok , but everyone else is just plain awful . also , who has ever heard of a shark that could break underwater glass ? who ok 'd a glass type in an underwater seaworld structure that could be broken by a shark 's nose hitting it 3 times ? ? ? that 's not too safe in my opinion . this is just a bad , bad movie . there is n't much that i can say is good about it ... but , i will give it 2 stars because it entertained me when i was a little boy and for that i am thankful
