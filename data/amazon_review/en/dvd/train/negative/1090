review of dvd not production firstly i have to say that this is not a mobile masterpiece production it is a bbc production . the production itself is excellent , my favorite adaption of the charles dickens novel . unfortunately the dvd has been put together as if you are watching the production on television . there is an introduction by an american presenter who states that what you are watching is a mobile production . this is tolerable but once you start watching you find that little icons appear on the screen as would appear on television ( i think they are to inform the viewer that wide screen is available ) . finally , before the end credits of the first part , you get to see what will be in next weeks episode . it would have been a simple matter to take the original recording as supplied by the bbc and use this one for the dvd . for some reason the dvd producer decided that is was better to have exactly the same recording as was shown on american television . if you want to get a copy of this production i would recommend getting one that was made for the british market
