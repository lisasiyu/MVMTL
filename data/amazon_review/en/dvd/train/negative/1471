kathy smith fan ... i have several kathy smith videos & never minded the outdated clothes , hair , or music because of the quality of the workout . i 've tried newer more popular videos every year & found the instructors prissy and their routines contrived . i 'm a big fan of kathy 's style and she never failed to deliver a truly effective workout that left me soaked w/sweat & ready to do it again the next day . having said that , this video sucked ! ! when i got pregnant i immediately sought out kathy 's video among all the other pregnancy fitness choices and was sorely disappointed . i think my grandmother could handle this routine on fast-forward ! ! i get more worked up doing my dishes than this video ! ! i 've resorted to just doing my favorite kathy smith step video without the step instead
