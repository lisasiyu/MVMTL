the producers were drunk when they made this movie most off the scientific facts are wrong . the earth 's center is as big as mars ! ! ! ! ! ! come on ! ! ! ! ! ! maybe as big as moon . under the earth 's ground is liquid magma . its liquid because off the pressure , and its not possible to under it . the producers obviously forget about food supplies , and oxygen . the only smart thing on which producers remembered is that the atomic bomb is activated with usual bomb that needs air . i think that this is the only realistic thing
