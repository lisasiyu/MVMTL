do not buy this , do not buy this , do not buy this , do not buy this , do not buy this , seriously ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i 'm sure that many people like this movie . but if you are looking at the directors cut version and says jet li collection at the bottom , then the dvd does not play . i got this at cd tradepost for 1.99 and it shows why it is priced that low . this movie comes in a collection that i do n't know the title of but it comes with a jackie movie , and shaolin idiot . they come in a nice looking 5-disc boxed set and it looks very intrigueing because they have them all in dvd cases like this and you have never seen them before . shaolin idiot-look this movie up if you do n't believe me and you think that i just do n't like this and am telling you not to watch it because of that . like 5 people have written a review saying the dvd does n't work , that is called confirmation . and one of the reviewers made a comment that this is not shaolin idiot but another stephen chow movie that sucks and he must have just seen this , the only other thing that i can think of is that he has the one dvd player that these discs work on . i have 7 dvd players and tried this dvd on a total of 12 dvd players , all different and i got a disc error on all of them . so obviously they just do n't work so just do n't buy this . this movie actually works in the jet li collection for 11.99 that i reviewd on here , and it is the worst picture quality i have ever seen for a non old scool movie . the translation seriously can not be read at all ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! , the sound is horrible , and i could n't even tell what was going on when billy chow and jet li were fighting ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i have plenty fo movies that come from a horrible film stock , but this competes with some of the all-time worst that i have ever seen . so i ca n't really recommend this either . this has got to be the only jet li movie i have n't seen that i have tried to find . i have his first 3 movies , but ca n't find jet li vs. billy chw part 2 . son of a mother f # & $ ^ % , piece of */ @ ! . if your eyes are already shot , then you may be able too watch this , but i challenge you to find a worse copy of any movie than what comes in the jet li collection .
