i am a b horror flick fan , but ... i thought that this movie fell short of even b horror flick standards . i did like the scenic shots of the film but the dialog and the `` mutants '' of this film did n't really hold my attention . the `` mutants '' were not even mutants at all . they looked like everyday people that you would see on the street . well , they did n't look disfigured is what i mean . the guy that was acting like he was part of the `` rap culture '' was the most irritating of them all . i really wanted to like this movie , but i am sorry that i did n't . i do n't recommend this movie to anyone . even those b horror fans
