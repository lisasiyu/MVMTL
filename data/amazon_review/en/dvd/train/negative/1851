disappointed with new voices we just purchased this item and when we got home and loaded it up , was very disappointed in the new voice they 're using for bob , lofty and spud ! the video itself is great and they 've introduced a new off-road 4x4 machine . but honestly , it just does n't seem like a bob the builder without the main voices we 're all used to
