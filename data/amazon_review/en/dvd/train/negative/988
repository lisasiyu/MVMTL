0 stars : not a horror movie , therefore not my thing . `` chopping mall '' is styled like an 80s slasher , but is in fact , not a horror movie . in actuality , what you get with this movie is more science fiction/action with some cheesey comedy as well . simply put , `` chopping mall '' does n't work as a horror movie because the killers are machines and therefore the element of evil is completely lacking which is not conduicive to a pure horror movie . in fact , one could argue that this movie is more or less like `` maximum overdrive '' or maybe even `` runaway '' ( in a sense ) , only not as good because those movies , while technically implausible , actually made some sense theoretically speaking , unlike this most unfortunate piece of rubbish known as `` chopping mall '' . i do not recommend `` chopping mall '' if you are looking for a horror movie or an 80s slasher flick as the movie is in all fairness a dark yet `` total farce '' . instead , i would recommend `` he knows you 're alone '' as probably the best of the relatively unknown 80s slasher/horror movies
