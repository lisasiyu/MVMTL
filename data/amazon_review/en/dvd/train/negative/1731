one of the worst remakes ever ... truly it is . i watched it once , and then just yesterday and it still was painful to watch . not because of the acting necessarily , although i think kidman is one lousy actress in any of her films and this one is no exception . but the story ... what happened ? seriously in the beginning it 's not so bad . yet the middle and end begin to terribly fall apart- especially since in one scene they 're saying one thing and then saying a completely other thing in another scene . basically we 're pulled along it seems to either the wives being robots like the old film says- and then we 're told it was just really chips in their brain making them housewives ? and somehow the chips disappear in the end and they become their real selves again ? then they make a real huge twist in the end which i guess i should n't give away but is just real tacky i think . just ... a mess of a film . i do n't know what happened , but it really fell apart in no time . if you 're interested in the story , then watch the old one- that sticks to their story all the way through very well . this remake though avoid seriously . 1/
