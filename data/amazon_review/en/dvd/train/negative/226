yuck ! this was a complete waste . walken is good , but god what a waste ! i never finished strieber 's first book which had intrigued me . but in succeeding books , he does nothing to prove anything . he gives a tale of experience that borders on religion . this horrible , suspenseless , and cheap film gives nothing to redeem strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke . maybe i should n't be so harsh on it . after all i 'm not a ufo reasercher or whatnot . but i 'm still human . i still have opinions . and my opinion of this is , yuck
