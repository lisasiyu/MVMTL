if you want to see dune , watch the miniseries ug . i really dislike this movie . dune is one of my favorite books , and this movie totally ruined it . it is boring , confusing , unfaithful to the book , and just plain badly done . if you want to see the real dune , watch the amazing miniseries done by sci-fi channel and it 's sequel , children of dune . both are much better done and much more faithful to the source material
