poof ! ! ! well , my gosh , what a waste of time , u2 really should give it up and just go away and stop plagaraising everything with their marketing money making schemes ( u2.com members , ticket prices . ) i wo n't go on and on about u2 being sold out , where it all went wrong , all i know is that u2 are getting by and panicked when popmart was'nt well recieved , mainly because they were silly enough not to finish the record and get a tour booked ahead of it . so the dvd ... boring whats wrong with it 1 . crap editing , as others have mentioned 2 . the band look bored 3 . bono looks like fat elvis 4 . bono ca n't sing anymore 5 . was it really neccesary to have a camera in bonos sunglasses ? 6 . extras ? ? ? two thirty second clips of zoo tv and popmart both of which they have'nt released on dvd and both of which are impossible to buy as vhs is extinct now . ( despite being their best live shows supporting two of their greatest albums . ) 7 . the credits are listed as a extra feature . 8 . plagued by material from the overated overhyped and boring album `` all that you ca n't leave behind '' . ... .has its moments , but at the end of the day its the performance that counts , not the lighting effects and the fancy but pointless and annoying unwatchable ! ! camera editing . if you want to have a collection of u2 live before they turned crap and commercialised add `` rattle and hum '' `` actung baby '' `` zoo tv live from sydney '' and `` popmart '' vhs 's to your collection , thats if you can dig them up from anywhere . u2 have yet to release a decent dvd , dissapoiting for the biggest band on earth
