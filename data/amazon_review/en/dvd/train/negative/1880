out of order.. ? incomplete is more accurate ! i was so excited when i saw this title released on dvd . i then foolishly puchased it not knowing they ruined it , and released it as a poor mini-movie of the showtime series . i still can not believe how showtime butchered this wonderful series into to 90 odd minutes of total garbage . is it any wonder why showtime always places a distant second to hbo on all of their productions
