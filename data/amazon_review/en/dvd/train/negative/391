bad i must say the positive reviews here fooled me . i expected much more fun . i would have loved a real blend of soap opera and ( even cheap ) fantastique . but this does n't even make the grade as 'so bad it 's good ' fun , at least for me . well , maybe the first episode , but the second is just very boring . yes , there is eye-candy in a soft porn kind of way , but not in the way of real cinematography ( very crude camera blocking ) or production design ( the hospital set is awful and as for the rest , they 're ok but too few ) . and it 's just too badly written . there 's some bad acting too , but that does n't really hurt this kind of movies . the second episode is less soft porn and more fantasy and plot-driven , but having to play every scene in the one same street and two or three poorly dressed sets , makes the characters eternally go back and forth between them , which gets tiresome pretty quick and also does n't allow for really fluid plot development . also fx or action scenes are sorely lacking . this could be secondary if the script were any good but there is no logic or clear rules in the universe they 're creating and it ends up a mess . i guess they did n't have much time to shoot this but overall it 's just not worth your time .
