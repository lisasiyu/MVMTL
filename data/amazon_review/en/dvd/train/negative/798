i love the show , the dvd 's are another story ! hello i wo n't sell you on the show-it 's one of my favorites , and you can read other 's opinions there . what i will say is that we are having a horrible time finding copies that play without scattering immages , or freezing up the player . so far we 've had to return episode one 2 times ( one time it came with 2 identical discs ( i.e one disc one , two discs two , and one disc 4 ) , we 've had to return season 2 and 3 for reasons that they 're not playable . it will play fine on one disc , then the next disc it crashes , pixilates , or wo n't load at all . we do n't have this problem with any other movies . so , beware , watch all the episodes before you put it on your shelf , and be prepared ( and if you are a true fan , you will do this ) to keep on trying until all the discs work . all that i can figure is that they were n't sure they 'd sell ( big mistake ) and made them cheap . what a shame . good luck
