pretentious i like some avant garde filmmaking , in particular animation , ex . norman mclaren , harry smith . but i feel like these brakhage films are a farce of what an art film is supposed to be like . the filmmaker seems to take what he is doing so seriously that it goes into parody of an `` art '' film . i 've seen college level work and home movies that are more insightful and entertaining . i had the chance once to see stan brakhage live in new york to screen one of his newer films a few years back . it was a film he shot in vancouver of the beach , and , seriously , it was like watching somebody 's home movies of the beach . then afterwards he goes into a discussion about the film and how it represents him dealing with illness and life and death . he was so pretentious and full of himself i had to laugh . the emperor has no clothes
