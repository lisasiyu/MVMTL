could have been put together allot better ! ! ! i 'm a huge fan of electronic dance music and anything to do with this genre ; i 've been to both the huge acts and the underground parties . this movie had good intensions , but the way it came together is a little lame . i recommend one beautiful day if you like coming of age movies to do with electronic movies .
