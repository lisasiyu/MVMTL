very anti-christian the movie has many none-too-subtle *very* anti-christian elements , particularly in the typical hollywierd portrayal of money grubbing `` christian '' tv evangelists and christians themselves as stupid zombies ; life as basically pointless . i am sick of hollywood rubbish like this ! so , if you 're a christian , stand firm -- do n't buy it ! !
