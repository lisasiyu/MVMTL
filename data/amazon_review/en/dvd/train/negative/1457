not worth your money ! ! i found this version at the library and decided to check it out . i was amazed at how bad it was . for one thing , they changed the story around which was bothersome . the singing is really bad , and i think the thing that that bothered me the most is the strange costumes ( tamino looks like an elf ! ) i also hated all the strange creatures that come out , instead of animals coming out when tamino plays his flute , they have people prancing out on stage dressed as who knows what . the whole thing was just horrible , costumes , the set , everything ... and a lot of times when the commentator is explaining a certain part , it 'll be playing a whole different aria ( or the wrong part of the aria . ) the whole thing is so chopped up , and the dvd is more blurry and grainy than i 've ever seen anything on dvd before . i would n't buy it or even waste yout time getting it from the library . you 're better off buying a real production on dvd of the magic flute for your kids , such as the one at the met with kathleen battle .
