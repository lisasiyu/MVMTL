kevin coughlan is spot on ! i 'd write a review for this sewage , but kevin did it so perfectly that i 'd be wasting my time . the only decent one of these bunch of horrible adaptations was silent hill , and even that one lacked the greatness of the video game . and now , there 's a spyhunter movie coming out ? wtf is next ? prince of persia ( ... please do n't do that one , i was only kidding ! ) ? get the video games for the real thing
