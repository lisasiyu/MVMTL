oh , no ... what a disappointment . watching matthau and lemmon struggle so hard to make this clanker enjoyable was nothing less than depressing . part of the enjoyment of the first odd couple was the clash of personalities between felix 's anal retentive , obsessive/compulsion and oscar 's boorish impatience . this film hardly touches upon that struggle and , instead , becomes a watered-down version of one of the grumpy old men movies . in fact , this movie seems like a compilation of other neil simon movies . when felix and oscar get lost in the californian desert , it 's `` the out of towners '' , except in reverse . when oscar 's son gets cold feet on his wedding day and camps out on the roof , it 's like `` plaza suite . '' also the use of the f-word and of middle fingers just makes the movie seem all that much more desperate for laughs . lastly , the florida/california milieu is just inappropriate for these two neurotic but iconic new yorkers
