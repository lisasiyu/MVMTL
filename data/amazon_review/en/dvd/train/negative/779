very poor presentation this could have been a very good documentary , but the video editing style made it unwatchable for me . the camera never stays on any subject for more than 5 seconds , film is sped up and slowed down for no apparent reason , and bright flashes of light with loud sound effects highlight the transition from scene to scene . the events surrounding 9/11 are fully capable of engaging my attention without this in-your-face style of presentation , which ironically dilutes the overall impact of the film
