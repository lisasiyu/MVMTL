there is one secret ... ... this dvd has very little to offer and even at its attractive price , it 's a waste of money . granted , i have done reading on meditation for years and have practiced sporadically . still , i do n't believe you could get much less from a dvd than is available on this one . there are detailed instructions on posture , hand position and the like . that takes about three minutes . i was very disappointed in the lack of in-depth instruction i would have expected from a dvd on meditation .
