unadvisable i thought i was going to see something of roy orbinson . it was only in the title of the name . i could not watch it when it became vulgar with offensive material . it is too bad to have a good story with great actors lowering its potentially good quality with such degrading vulgarity . there are better ways of getting this aspect of the story across with such depiction . silly me , i should have checked the rating . i `` assumed '' it safe as it would involve our beloved roy orbinson . i was sadly and horridly disappointed and can not in conscience recommend it to anyone at anytime . by the way , i destroyed the tape in good conscience . watch at your own eternal risk
