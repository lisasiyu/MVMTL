worth a rental let me start off by saying , i have not seen the orignal wicker man . this movie kept me guessing all the way through , which earns it one star . i could n't tell if willow was intentionally mysterious or a victim of bad acting . i did enjoy ellen burstyn 's performance as the `` queen bee '' so to speak . so many unanswered questions or things that did n't add up stop this from being a 4 or 5 star movie . i am generally not a fan of neat , tidy , happy endings , so that was n't a problem for me , but the numerous loose ends were . worth a rental , but probably not worth purchasing
