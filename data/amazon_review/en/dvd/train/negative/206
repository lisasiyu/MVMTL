to buy or not to buy i was dispointed from seying this movie . after seing wild orchid movies , 9 182 weeks movies and two moon junction movies i was expecting wide sargo sea to be a great movie after seing the editorial about it . the course of the movie was really good but near the end when she looses everything was tragic to mee . i did not get the point of this movie . it 's worth renting . but i certainly would not buy it
