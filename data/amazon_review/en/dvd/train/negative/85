profoundly unfunny and completely unwatchable film . completey and utterly unfunny performances by oldman and roth . stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not , having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen . we get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play . watching the first fifteen minutes of `` heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , heads , '' is colossal torture , like status elipticus . it 's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen . having hopes it might pick up , that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever . a classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums . do n't take my word for it , watch it yourself and see .
