5 stars for the film , 1 for this dvd release i 've waited for years to get this wonderful classic on dvd and was so disappointed to discover it 's only available in a full-screen format . for those who do n't know the difference , this classic was originally filmed in a widescreen format , so to make it fit the traditional square television , they had to crop out a lot of the picture . what 's more , this `` restored '' version contains no documentaries -- only trailers and cast lists . i e-mailed sony about a possible widescreen release and was told there are no plans for another release at this time . what a shame ! the film was released on vhs in a widescreen format and deserved to be handled with the same respect in the dvd release . if you want to get the full impact of the theatrical release , do n't buy this chopped-up version . save your money and watch the vhs or widescreen airings on turner classic movies . eventually someone will do right by this film and release a better dvd
