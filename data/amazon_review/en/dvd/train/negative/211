lucas strikes ! note : this review is not about the trilogy ( which is great ) . this review is about the many dvd releases . the worst thing that ever happened to george lucas is when peter jackson released the extended version of lotr . jackson showed fans we could demand , expect , and receive more from hollywood . the impact of peter jackson sent shock waves among fans , who released a four-disc edition of one of the greatest movies of all time . even old hollywood guards , like ridley scott and james cameron ( no surprise they are not americans ) took notice and improved their dvd releases . this change has been powerful , except in the case of lucas and to some degree his pal steven spielberg , who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers . the many re-releases shows greediness , stubbornness , and lack of respect for fans . no one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version , but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality . in addition , please stop using the `` limited edition '' you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of star wars ; it is both false and tiring . release these films in anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 surround sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release . lucas 's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his star war movies . unfortunately , his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar . his shady practice of video/dvd releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him . one must wonder what went through lucas mind when peter jackson won an academy award for best director and not him . maybe if he focus on making quality films ( like he once did ) and not playing the dvd re-re-re-release game , then he could win one .
