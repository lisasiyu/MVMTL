thompson the terrible why do i dislike emma thompson so much as an actress ? aha , i know why -- she ca n't act . she can read lines and make gestures , but never makes me believe for a second that she 's who she 's pretending to be . she ruins everything she touches . i have to admit i could n't watch this in its entirety , purely because of her . for those who have n't seen the show , just look at her picture on the box ; she looks like a woman wearing a hat that belongs somewhere , anywhere , else . it 's like a pimple on cheese . apart from her , it was ok , but i do n't like branagh either , another actor afflicted with an unhealthy dose of self-consciousness in his acting , which is fatal
