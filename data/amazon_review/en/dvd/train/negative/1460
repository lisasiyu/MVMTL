embarrassing seldom has so much talent ( and money ! ) been wasted on such unentertaining silliness . robin williams , dustin hoffman , maggie smith , julia roberts , bob hoskins -- it is painful to watch them cope with the bad writing , overemoting , over-elaborate ( and dull ) sets , and just general aimlessness of this picture . everybody works really hard , and the strain shows . the fun seems forced , the situations pointless , the message ham-handed , and the music -- oh , my goodness -- the music is the most syruppy mess this side of `` pearl harbor . '' even the special effects are less than special . all in all , very uncomfortable to sit through
