ugh this is an extremely dry anime . the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor . not so for the anime . the character batou was especially funny in the manga , but , for reasons unknown , he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version . expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking . these really make the movie crawl . one minute there 's action , next you 're listening to matoko or batou go on and on about existentialism . seriously , these little talks , take up 3/4 of the movie . the visuals are awesome , no question about that . even so , they do not fulfill the need for some kind of thread of a story . altogether , not much actually , happens during the movie . if you must see it , rent it first to be sure you want it
