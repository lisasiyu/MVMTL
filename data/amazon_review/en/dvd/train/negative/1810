not for young children ! i absolutely could not believe this cartoon . can you imagine a superhero using swear words ? well , that 's what you have with this one . still ca n't believe it . what on earth are they trying to do with spiderman ? this obviously is a series for adults because , quite frankly , superheroes are supposed to be out for justice , truth and the american way , not to spend time in the gutter learning all the trash they can to spread it wherever . i do n't recommend this product at all . ours is going into the trash
