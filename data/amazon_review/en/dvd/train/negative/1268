diabolical what a terrible dvd . i 'm no pessimist , this was recorded horribly . either shannon hoon 's voice is awful or the recording was . i suspect it was the latter . i will admit , i 'm not a hardcore blind melon fan , but i 'd downloaded some of their songs like mouth full of cavities et al..and was very impressed . i read the previous reviews and took the gamble of buying the dvd . what a mistake . i also bought alice in chains unplugged which is excellent . if you want to see a grown man wearing makeup and flaling his hands like an octopus while shreeking to the crowd buy this . otherwise save your money .
