manipulative trash i 'm disgusted by depalma . this is trash and so is he . it is too manipulative and it is completely his fault . he stretches out these horror scenes in the most manipulative way , as we watch travolta fight his way through crowds to save the girl . this kind of manure ( self censorship ) angers me . this is n't art . it 's garbage . his whole purpose is to manipulate us , to extend the horror scene in the most manipulative way . do n't you see how phony it is ? do n't you resent how he is playing with your emotions ? you call this art ? you call this talent ? you call this good directing ? it 's trash . he stinks . if he 's trying to copy hitchcock , he 's not doing it right . why not show us travolta swimming through sharks trying to save the girl . i got it . how about travolta pushing kindergarten kids out of the way trying to save the girl from a four year old strangler . and stretch the scene out , make it last through the whole milk and cookies period , as travolta keeps pushing kids out of his way and the kids are merrily eating their oreos and the girl is getting strangled . eeek . that 's a good scream . depalma , you stink . what other stupid tricks can you do
