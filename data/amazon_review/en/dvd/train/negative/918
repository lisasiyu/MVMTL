rock bottom from a lifelong lover of l & h films , zero stars , unless negative numbers are an option . these films are lousy through and through , and no degree of print quality or extras or low price or anything else could make me want them . they are painful to watch and about as humorous as henry daniell playing doctor moriarty . in deference to the two funniest men who ever lived , these atrocities should be burned along with the rest of the 1940s garbage forced upon stan and ollie after roach sold their contracts . if you really like laurel and hardy , do yourself a favor and get the 21-disc l & h set from amazon.uk . it contains all their shorts ( sound and silent ) and some of the early movies . it also contains the foreign language versions , in which l & h and most of the other actors actually speak their lines in spanish , french , etc . further , it includes different versions of certain titles . for `` bonnie scotland '' and `` fra diavolo , '' get the separate 2-disc set in ntsc . you 'll have to purchase a region-free , pal converting dvd player , but they are widely available in the united states and will play anything . ( do n't buy a cheap one -- the good ones are hardly expensive .
