great play , but look at the editing into the woods is one of my sondheim favorites . having seen the pbs presentation of this , i am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this dvd is edited . rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction , this dvd uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups . this especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play ; the staging . by forcing the viewer 's perspective , this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath . i am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director 's vision
