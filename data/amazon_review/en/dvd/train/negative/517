too much reality and not enough laughter was looking forward to seeing this film , quite disappointing . joan cusack is always a bit of a downer in a film . once she appears in a film it is always a bit depressing . jennifer anniston is usually pretty good , but the story line was just too depressingly like real life to be funny , i felt . just not funny enough to carry the depressing story line . not a film i will be watching again , sadly .
