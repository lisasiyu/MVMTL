just is n't very good i 'm a big fan of joe dante and i love martin short , but 'innerspace ' is just too high on concept and low on just about everything else . you know the tendency for even many great comedies to somehow `` require '' a villian sub-plot ? well 'innerspace ' not only falls victim to that , but the `` on the chase from the bad guy '' scenario propels the film . i guess you could call it `` adventure '' , but there 's nothing interesting or exciting about it . short does what he can here and there , but most of it feels like made-for-tv filler material ... honestly . i do n't know ... dante is a creative genius , but this is his most lacking imo . sure , this is one flick that has brilliant special effects and does n't ever overplay them , but you almost wish they 'd had , because at least something interesting would be happening . 'gremlins ' and 'the 'burbs ' had awesomely unique concepts but , by and large , maintained a degree of freshness around them for their running time ; 'innerspace ' ca n't survive for any real length of time . the concept of the film is great , no doubt , and the actual execution of the fundamental mental/physical relationship between short and quaid is pulled off with valor ... which is strange , because it 's the superficial aspects of the film that fall on their face . i guess that makes sense ; dante is an imaginative nut , and in the face of a drab script and story , he does n't know what to do
