direct to video potboiler re-tread that never should have been made this direct to video `` sequel '' is actually more of a re-tread of the original 1998 guilty pleasure erotic thriller/film noir potboiler , and another of the countless , and pointless , direct to video sequels to come from sony/comlumbia/tri-star as of late ( cruel intentions 2 & 3 , starship troopers 2 , shall i go on ? ) . wild things 2 focuses around a rich girl ( susan ward ) whose stepfather mysteriously dies , and the only thing standing in her way of inheritance is her high school rival ( son of the beach 's hot leila arcieri ) who claims to be the man 's true , biological daughter . naturally , just like in the original , there are plot twists aplenty , as learned by an insurance investigator ( isiah washington , giving a somewhat inspired performance ) , and naturally , there are double crosses , murders , and a redux of the first film 's threesome , only it 's not as erotic as the original 's . wild things 2 is n't just a cardboard copy of the original with none of it 's good points , it 's a solid waste of film that even fans of the original film will hate . is it worth seeing ? depends how much you liked the first wild things , but for the rest of us , just watch the original and forget this ever happened
