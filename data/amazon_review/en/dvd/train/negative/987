calling this the worst horror movie is kind this is movie is a nice big pile of warm doo doo.there nothing entertaining about this film horrible acting and serious over acting are just the beginning to this mess.no story to be found super bad special fx .i mean u can see raw meat toss about and the new guinea zombies look like brothers and sisters u find in compton california.and adding stock footage is plan lazy.i do n't know if the person who directed this still alive if he is he should be made to work at mcdonald 's making fries for lif
