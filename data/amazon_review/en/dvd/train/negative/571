the second worst dinosaur movie first off , special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality . but at least this is better than the abomination that was jaws . the only dinosaur movie i can think of that 's worse than this is raptor , which consists of parts of the three carnosaur movies cut & pasted together . it has some redeeming feature in that ian malcom and john somedoy ( i forget his last name ... the guy who owns the park ) were actually interesting characters . i guess steve speilberg finally realised that monster/animal attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey 's rear end about . unfortunately , the boring , stereotypical alan grant was the central character in this . if you want to watch a steven spielburg movie that 's actually good , watch e.t . or something . or `` the lost world : jurassic park '' ( even though recommending a sequel may seem lame , the sequel is a million times better than this ) if you want to see a dinosaur movie , then watch either the sequel to this movie , or arthur conan doyle 's `` the lost world '' . i would also recomend the 'carnosaur ' movies but i think they 're out of print . if you want to see a movie where sam neill plays an interesting chracter , watch 'in the mouth of madness ' or 'triangle' but definitely avoid this movie . the only reason i even own it is because it was sold in a box set with `` the lost world : jurassic park
