almost it is usually a bad sign when there is a guide included to explain the movie makers reasons for making the movie and to explain the lesson they want to teach . the movie does give you a conclusion for the anime . there is little to laugh at in this movie , the directors are to focused on making their point . they have decided to make the anime and movie more `` real '' than the manga and as such have lost the light hearted humor and in their attempts to be `` realistic '' have created inconsistancies that can not be explained . the music and animation are excellent . but i would recommend buying the soundtrack and renting the movie
