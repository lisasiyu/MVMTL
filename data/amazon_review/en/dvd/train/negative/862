transvestite speaks out sadly ... when ann coulter ( a transvestite - or possibly even a transgender patient him/herself ? ) launched her patently absurd & lame attack on john edwards ' sexuality ( never in question before ann 's pitiful attack ) ... she lost all credibility ... even with her beloved far right . if she ca n't argue the politics then i suggest she simply shut up . for this reason ... and so many others ... i have absolutely no interest in anything further to do with ann coulter . she gives conservatism a bad name
