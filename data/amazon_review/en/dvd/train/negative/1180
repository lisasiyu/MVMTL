language is not russian ( as stated by amazon ) but chezh . be aware ! if you do n't understand russian and going to follow subtitles - this one is for you . the dvd quality is perfect ( i 'm not gon na say anything about the movie - lots of reviews here ) . but the fact that amazon said it is russian but it turned out to be chezh made me sad .
