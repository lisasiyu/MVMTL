great family show but poor transfer quality & no extras.. now do n't get the wrong impression of my rating because this is an excellent family show and it gets 5 stars it that area , but the 2 rating is my opinion of the poor way that this quality show was put on dvd.. first i noticed that this is a bare bones transfer with no extras but you would think since we are paying good money for these dvds that they would at least make sure the trasnfer quality from film to dvd is excellent , but sadly its not , it seems like there was not much care taken in the transfer process . let me explain , during the opening music i noticed that it fades in and out something that i did not notice in the previous 3 seasons . also on a few episodes i just watched , it appears like there was little cleaning up of the film done before transfer to get rid of all the spots or floaters that sometimes appear on older films , it would have been nice if the time was taken to remaster the film for good dvd viewing . it also would have been nice to include a closed caption feature for the hearing impaired for those who need it . in closing i really enjoy watching the waltons and i am very pleased to have it on dvd , but if a little more care and extra work was put into the transfer process this could be so much better and i would feel i am getting the most for my money spent ...
