a rotten musical this film represents the low point in the splashy grable musicals released by twentieth century fox during the war . the story/script is really appalling and bruce humberstone , a frequently poor director , adds nothing . grable plays a secretary doubling as a night club performer . as far as plot , that is about it . in typical fox fashion , the colour and sound are excellent . grable looks attractive but the makeup is quite heavy , particularly the bleached blonde hair . she was pregnant during shooting and the costumes have been designed to hide this . one would hope that martha raye and joe e brown would help but the material is so bad that they are just noisy and distracting . most of the songs are lousy too - duds like `` do n't carry tales '' . two redeeming feature - the song `` once too often '' as hermes pan and grable perform a tame apache dance and the title tune , nicely sung by grable in close up . the film represents hollywood cynicism at its worst . fox built a film around grable 's status as the pin up of world war 2 but neglected to give her a script or a decent leading man . not to worry , the public will come anyway and , of course , so they did . in the long run , though , junk like this chips away at the reputation of this appealing star who barely holds the film together by sheer star quality , her pretty face and her sense of humour . if you are not an ardent grable fan , you 'll hate the film . `` pin up girl '' really supports the view that betty grable made poor films which do n't warrant revival . in fact many of them are first rate entertainments but certainly not this one ! it should , however , be noted that the print of the film in this dvd is excellent and among the extras is an entertaining deleted number which can be seen already in the hidden hollywood series
