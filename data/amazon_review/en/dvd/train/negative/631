too many changes i loved gilad from watching him on espn and love the beach scenes . however , i felt like he went too fast ; i was playing catch-up because he switched from one thing to another very quickly . there were n't a lot of repeats before moving on to something new . maybe if i did it more and got used to it , i would n't mind . however , i much prefer my kathy smith and cathe videos . this one is just collecting dust for me right now . maybe i 'll give it a try another time , but i regret buying it
