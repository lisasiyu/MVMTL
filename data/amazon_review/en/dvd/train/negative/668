bridges of madison county dvd the dvd was okay and i needed it for a gift ( which i was late for - my fault ) . i received it in 5 days but it arrived totally smashed . it was packed in a stiff yellow envelope but needed more packing . the outside of the package was marred but not ripped open . but when i opened it i was horrified that the entire case was crushed . i delicately took it apart and it seemed that the dvd was untouched so i put it in another generic case that i had around the house . that was disappointing because the case it came in was very attractive and i could n't fit it in my case . because i was late with my gift , i did n't have time to send it back to you . the price was right , the service was quick , just bulk up on your shipping a little
