not another teen movie ! ! ! milo ventimiglia ( gilmore girls , the bedford diaries ) stars as zack harper , a kid who helps out his friend kyle who is in a bit of a rut . kyle was challenged by a senior to do the dirty deeds . the dirty deeds ( there 's 10 of them ) are just random things on a piece of paper the person has to accomplish . there 's also a record that has never been beating before . so , milo sets out to do the dirty deeds and there 's also a party being thrown at a house where they keep a scoreboard of how many milo has done . not another teen movie ! ! just had to say that but its bascially what it is . in american pie you had jason biggs doing the pie and in this , well milo ventimigla enters a bag of whole wheat bread ( if you know what i mean ) . milo helps the film but nothing is special about this movie . more moronic characters . my advice is watch it ( unrated or not ) once and the decisions are up to you . also starring lacey chabert ( not another teen movie , mean girls ) of course , mark derwin ( one life to live , heist ) , zoe saldana ( drumline , pirates of the caribbean ) , panso gorson ( south of nowhere , dear wendy ) , billy l. sullivan ( my life , little big league ) , ray santiago ( meet the fockers , pinero ) , todd zeile ( king of queens , snl ) , michael milhoan ( american gun , pearl harbor ) , erin torpey ( crescendo , one life to live ) , arielle kebbel ( aquamarine , be cool ) , dave power ( frailty , boston public ) and charles durning ( the final countdown , rescue me ) for some odd reason that i dont know why . what does the unrated version have to offer ? female nudity what else ? !
