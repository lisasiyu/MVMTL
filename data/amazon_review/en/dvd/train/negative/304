in a word : disgraceful the first butterfly effect is one of my all-time favorite movies . with that in mind , i eagerly started watching be2 . within the first 5 minutes it became clear that i was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie . but after finishing it , it was clear that i would have to flat-out lie to do that . there is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie : erica durance naked . but it 's too softcore , short , and pointless to really be worth anything . the writing is terrible . the story is lifted directly from the original , only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion . it manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical , a feat unparelleled in modern film . the protagonist comes off as an idiotic , self-concerned , petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with . the acting is ... barely passable , for the most part , but the story 's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express . the first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this ? would this one be the last ? in the sequel , this is gone , but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting . if you have any fond memories of the first one , avoid this turd
