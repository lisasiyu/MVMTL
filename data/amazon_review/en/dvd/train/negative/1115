it is a jungle ... boy , this dvd is just a jumble of old episodes , which are fine . but , it 's just not cohesive overall . feels very disjointed when watching it . the good thing is my 2 year old loves watching it . she only learned `` m '' and `` u '' from this overpriced dvd , but at least she likes watching it . i must say , i was afraid she would n't like `` meet the letters '' after watching this dvd countless times , but she does ( i highly recommend meet the letters , if you want your young ones to actually learn ) . oh , she could call out all the letters after watching `` meet the letters '' for about 2 weeks . is it because she watched the jumbled `` jungle '' for about 3 weeks earlier ? maybe . but , she sure heck did n't call out the letters while watching it ( other than `` m '' and `` u '' as mentioned ) . this is a good dvd that entertains . i would 've actually gave it at least 3 stars if it were n't for the price ( $ [ ... ] b & n ) , considering that they only had to create those few new scenes with elmo , zoey and telly .
