well , that was dreadful . i only bought this dvd , because i 'm a rabid jason isaacs fan , and i 'm intent on eventually seeing everything in his imdb listing , but yeesh . this was just painful . the only good parts were jason as clark devlin and debbie mazar as steena , and those parts were entirely too brief . in fact , there is a much , much better movie featuring those two particular characters implied in this forgettable little piece of nonsense . i really wish i owned that movie .
