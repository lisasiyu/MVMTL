campy horror film falls flat even though originally titled , `` andy warhol 's dracula '' , this film had very little to do with andy warhol . udo kier plays a count visitng italy to satisfy his `` special diet '' , i.e . `` virgin blood . '' though the royal family 's daughters seem promising , joe dellesandro ( who uses the andy warhol style of `` non acting '' ) is busy making them ineligible for the count 's requirements . the count 's reaction to non virgin blood ( in repeat scenes ) has to be among the grossest scenes in film , next to the end of pink flamingos . other than that , the movie wanders , the dialogue is dull , the political conflicts unnecesary ( remember this was the 70 's ) and parts of it are closer to soft core porn or badly acted costume drama than horror . though not as amazingly awful as `` sins of the fleshapoids '' or ed wood ( who has a certain charm ) blood for dracula will leave you scratching your head one moment and then turning it away from the screen the next
