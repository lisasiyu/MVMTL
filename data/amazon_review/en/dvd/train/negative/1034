dvd mars an otherwise okay film . this looks like a shot-on-video low-budget effort . a young woman gets involved with a drug dealer/murderer who 's sent to prison . she helped him almost escape , resulting in the death of a cop , so she goes into hiding as a club dancer . eight years later , her past comes back to haunt her . the film is decent enough to merit 3 stars , but i 'm deducting one because of the dreadful dvd . what 's so bad about it ? i 'm truly annoyed by dvds that keep viewers as a captive audience , forcing them to sit through production credits or fbi warnings , unable to fast forward . it 's an insulting time waster for the audience . but carlita 's secret takes it to new levels . the dvd opens with about a minute of production credits and fbi warnings , followed by a 5 1/2 minute promo short that one is forced to watch . no fast foward allowed , nor does the menu button work . altogether , over 6 minutes of crap that one must sit through before the film . then after the film is over , before you can go back to the menu , you have to sit through the same 5 1/2 promo short yet again . hey maverick entertainment , there 's a reason dvd players come with fast forward and menu buttons . it 's so that we the viewer can decide what portion of a dvd that we paid for we choose to watch , when we choose to watch it . instead , every time i want to watch this film , i have to sit through your promo crap . shame on maverick entertainment for stealing the viewer 's time like this . if you get this film , you may want to pop it in the dvd player well before you plan to watch the movie . pop it in and then get some snacks or whatever so you wo n't be forced to watch the promo crap . that should be a choice , not something dvd distributors force down on a captive audiece
