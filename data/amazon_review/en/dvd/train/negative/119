poor value even though i love tamilee this item was a big disappointment and a waste of money for me . i love tamilee and her arms and abs video from a few years ago . that 's why i was excited to see what i thought was a newer production of arms and abs workouts . the cover was different than the video and there was no reference to the older video in the description , so i thought the dvd contained all new workouts . the 3 arms and abs workouts were exactly the same as the old video , so did me no good . i did n't buy the dvd for the lower body workouts , but viewed them just to see what they were . two out of three are somehow cued incorrectly from the dvd menu , meaning you select workout 2 , for example , and the dvd takes you to the cool down session from workout number 1 ! because sequential workout video tapes are still easier to use for home-exercisers than dvds since you do n't have to remember which workout you are on - you just stop the tape one day and restart the tape another day - this dvd is just a back-up for the tape i already use
