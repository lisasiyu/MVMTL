frosty -- 5 stars , frosty returns-0 stars frosty is a perfect classic as always . great story and characters . but , boy frosty returns makes this one you should probably skip . first , the story and songs are weak . second , christmas is n't even mentioned . the directors have fallen for the left wing anti-christmas agenda , resulting in the kids school having a `` winter carnival '' instead . pathetic . the real frosty would melt with anger .
