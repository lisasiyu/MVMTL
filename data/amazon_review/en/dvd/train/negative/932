dreadful save your money or give it to charity . this is one of the worst films for a long time . the characters are one-dimensional , you do n't care who they are and when they die , you 're indifferent . the direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory . i was so bored with this film that i ca n't even bring myself to write anything else about it
