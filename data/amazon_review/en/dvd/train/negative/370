sadly , the lack of liam neeson and raimi 's directing is what ruined this movie for me . while mr. vasloo is superb in his taking on the burden of the liam created character and mr. drake always has appeal , the movie as a whole needed a much better script . it was too predicatble , too phoney . on the bonus side , they did manage to keep the hapahazard and crazy comments darkman makes during chases and fight scenes in tact , so that was a plus
