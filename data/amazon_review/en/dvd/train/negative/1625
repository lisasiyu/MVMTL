do n't buy into the `` product description . '' first , to debunk the product description , the most terrifying `` jaws '' ever will always be the first . nothing after that is even in the same league . and this chapter continues the devolution that started after the ending credits of the original , topped only by `` jaws 4- the revenge , '' in being worse . `` iii was originally released at the theater in 3-d , which did n't improve it by any stretch , rather made it more of a novelty . in viewing in non-3d release , it 's even worse because you can see how the director catered to the 3-d scenes , which are obvious when you watch it now . the acting could n't be more `` made for tv , '' as can be said about the whole storyline , the scenes and the deception freely utilized by the camera and director . this is one of those movies where you constantly find yourself scoffing , `` yeah , right ! `` , when seeing many of the sequences . even the very ending of the movie caused us to laugh with contempt when exiting the theater . once again , another movie , regardless of how bad it is , i peak at it occasionally when on the dish just to watch lea thompson , even though her acting in this one is nothing for the time capsules . the same can be said of the whole cast in fact , including , shamefully , louis gossett jr. , fresh off his oscar winning `` officer and a gentleman '' role . he could n't have a more annoying , over the top , archetypical character . i hope the check was worth it louis . there 's nothing nearly as suspenseful , dramatic , or engaging as the original . there are no characters that you really care about- there 's no depth , merely posturing by the characters . and the climax ' plausibility is an insult to one 's intelligence . this movie is just plain bad . in that it can be worth a watch alone , just to take pot shots at the absurdity of it all and to see how far down making a buck had dragged down the once proud brand name of `` jaws .
