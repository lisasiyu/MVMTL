tempo skips a beat in this derivative , limp made for canadian tv movie , melanie griffith stumbled through the role of a glitzy `` courier '' for obviously illegal products . she has a younger live-in stud ( hugh dancy in a weak performance ) and is sent on a secretive mission by malcolm mcdowell ( he pops up in almost anything these days ) . melanie also has a sleazy additional boss ( played with absent malice by art malik ) who screws up the mcdowell deal and then demands eighty thousand dollars for the effort . along comes lovely rachael leigh cook ( who deserves better than this ) who suddenly becomes the true love of dancy 's miserable life . dancy is such a spineless cad one can hardly feel sympathy for the miss the three of them end up in . it 's all been done before and much much better . tempo is a composition without any heart
