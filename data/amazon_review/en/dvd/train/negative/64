more `` lost cause '' mythology it 's amazing how hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to secession mythology , from birth of a nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification . this is a very dull , shapeless , stilted movie . i would n't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds , but since it is above all a piece of propaganda , i 'm compelled to condemn it as history . what it presents is the `` war between the states '' version of the civil war , in which the gallant southerners defend their homes , their beloved hills and dales , their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the north . there are only two black characters , both sentimentally loyal to their southernness and their masters ; otherwise , slavery is beside the point . the generalship of lee and jackson , of course , is idolized , while the northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools . the battle scenes are perfectly predictable ; guys charge on foot , other guys shoot , the fields are littered with bodies . would n't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting ? how real is it to show only one train , and that southern , in a war won more by transportation than by musketry ? if you are a believer in the myth of the lost cause and the justice of secession , if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the war was n't really about slavery , then i challenge you honor ! i defy you to read just one heavy , scholarly book , arguing about slavery by william lee miller , a professor at the university of virginia . it retells the debates that occurred in the house of representatives , over slavery , in the 1830s , twenty-five years before the election of lincoln . the uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the civil war had deeper roots than you thought , and that slavery was indeed the central issue for both sides , blue and grey
