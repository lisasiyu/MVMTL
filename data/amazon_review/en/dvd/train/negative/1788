the creek definitely took a nosedive in its college years , but ... i had n't seen all of these episodes when they aired -- nor all of seasons 4 or 5 , as my interest/obsession waned after the crew went to college -- so it was worth it to me to be able to view them all in full . however , they are n't very good and i very much doubt that i will watch them again and again over time the way i might the first 3 seasons . the final two-part episode is an exception but if one wanted , one could buy that episode alone on dvd . the creators took the helm back for the series finale and it focuses on our original 4-5 characters ( 5 if you include jack ) , leaving out audrey and others , which i for one very much appreciated . although to me they already had enough of an acceptable reason and to reunite everyone in capeside ( five years in the future ) and enough material w/which to surprise us ( and tie up some loose ends ) all in a nice melodramatic/comedic fashion without *killing another character off* . ( after both abbey and mitch met accidental deaths in earlier seasons , i feel like it gets to be a bit much -- but at least this time , there 's a believable -- although rarely occurring -- medical cause . ) at least joey ended up with the right guy ( in my not-so-humble opinion ) . basically , if you 're a committed dawson 's ( err , joey 's ; - ) creek fan and want to collect the whole set , you 'll want to purchase this season . otherwise , though , you might consider skipping it and maybe buying the series finale separately . also , special features were sorely lacking . this set marked the end of one of the wb 's most successful shows that launched acting careers for several young people ; the least they could have done is include behind-the-scenes interviews with cast/crew ! creator commentary on the last episode just does n't cut it
