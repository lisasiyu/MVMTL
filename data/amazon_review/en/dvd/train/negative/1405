what the ? ? ? i was n't expecting a whole lot out of mimic 2 . after all , it was the direct-to-video sequel for a science fiction film that did n't do very well at the box office to begin with . however , even with my low expectations i was disappointed . the film started off well enough , having a minor character from the first film become the lead in this one . however , nothing exciting was done with the concept . instead , the premise of the original was stretched as far as it would go beyond belief . the last remaining judas bug knows its time is running out . so , it has to mate so the species will continue to survive . however , this bug evolved to the point where it adapted to mimic humans . therefore , the only creature worthy of it mating with is a human . get it ? pretty twisted , huh ? good . now , do n't waste your time watching this movie
