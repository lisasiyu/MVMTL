hollow . terrible . one good line quoted here . the characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting . an effort to watch . make-up , dyed hair , costumes poorly done . one man 's eyebrows , the suitor 's , are altered like a woman 's ! no scenery or homes of interest , except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor . not a pleasant pace , without humor , without intrigue . a lesbian undertone in one scene . the only positive thing i can think of is this good line of jane austen , quoted . fanny sums up in one sentence , why she will not marry him . women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty , will wish to sum up their certainty with ms. austen 's line : `` his sole interest is in being loved , not in loving '' . this line is an exception to a lifeless script . there , now you do not need to endure the painful movie . here are two lines re-written by me : for the woman dealing with a trifling man : `` no man suffers pains of love on the stage . '' for dealing with the infatuated man : `` you have wounded yourself , but not with love . '' this movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of jane austen . there is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film , humorous , with singing , with interest . a movie can take the best of the book , in the spirit of the book , which this movie did not carry , and make a movie better than the book . this movie is bad any which way . well-made period romance films are : `` pride & prejudice 2005 , 1996 , & 1940 '' , `` wives & daughters '' , `` north & south '' . fairly made is `` under the greenwood tree '' . i rated `` persuasion '' at 2-stars for the wooden acting ; however `` persuasion '' is 5-stars compared to this `` mansfield park '' . `` persuasion '' has attractive scenery , costumes , beautiful singing , and an uplifting plot ; though of interest only to women , preferably who have already read the book .
