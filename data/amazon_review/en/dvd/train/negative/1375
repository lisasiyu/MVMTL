not really essential now i love the clash as much as anyone else , but this dvd is n't really needed . they made some of the greatest records of all time , but they never really made great videos . more interviews and live performances would have been nice , and the inclusion of the late , great joe strummer 's short film is a welcome addition , but i would recommend that you just buy the studio albums over this dvd & gt
