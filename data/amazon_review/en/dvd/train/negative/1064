stick with suspiria i already knew before buying this movie that i wouldnt like it , atleast it comes with phenomena wich is alot better imo . inferno is not one of argento 's best at all and doesent even deserve to be known as a sequel to suspiria . i like all of his films espesially the gallio ones but this just doesent hold up to his other work . it does have all his imagination but not his style . pick it up with phenomena and maybe youll like it but i doubt it
