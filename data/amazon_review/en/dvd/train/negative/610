this new deluxe edition is a disgrace to sony home ent . yes , indeed ! the booklet included is nice and glossy . thanks ! and the two documentaries added this time around are nice too . thanks again ! but what about the film itself ? has that been given the deluxe treatment as well ? sad answer : definitely not ! as a matter of fact , this new `` re-master '' looks much worse than the previous dvd . that one was a very fuzzy non-anamorphic mess , but this new anamorphic one is just as fuzzy . in fact , when i put the old one in the zoom mode , there is no difference in focus and contrast whatsoever . and the colors are somewhat more warm and pleasant on the old edition . but worst of all , is that the new dvd is cropped on all four sides ! there is quite a lot of more picture information available on the old disc , especially on top of the frame ! so much for a deluxe edition ! shame on you , sony/mgm-ua ! fans of this film - myself included - will have to keep the old dvd , and get this new one for the extras and the booklet . ( the 2 stars above are for those inclusions alone . ) this is certainly no way to treat loyal film fans and costumers willing to pay for an upgrade version of a beloved film
