[ no 0 star rating ] an unbelievably stupid film reading the posted reviews here , is like revisting the ballessssss white liberals who are portrayed in this preschool-level , skewered portrayal of the 60 's . white = bad ( you can finish the equation . ) for those considering hi , mom whether for purchase or rental , be sure to watch it with your ( white ) wife and then project her into depalma 's puerile depiction of a liberal couple , attending an all black drama ( except for deniro who conveniently is portraying the viscious hunky cop ) . then witness her being raped and mauled while you are beaten . why ? because you are white ! stupidity not worthy of further commentary
