very frustrated with fake accents ! ! as an avid agatha christie fan , i was thrilled to receive this movie as a gift for my birthday . i had watched the two other movies staring peter ustinov as hercule poirot and absolutely loved them ! ! however , i was so bored and frustrated throughout this movie . albert finney was a terrible poirot . i honestly could barely understand a word he and some of the other actors were saying . the accents were barely comprehendable . i had to play and replay the end where the mystery is solved . i am very upset my husband spent the money on buying this movie as i am sure that i will never be able to sit through it again . the plot was great , however , some of the acting was horrid . i am only giving it two stars because it is based on an agatha christie novel . based on the film itself ; no stars . if you can understand even half of what albert finney is saying , you 're a better woman than i
