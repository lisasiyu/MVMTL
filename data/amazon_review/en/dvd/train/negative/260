burr did not answer straight unfortunately i had already ordered these dvd 's before i logged onto the bar method website , on the site there are news clips posted from old interviews etc . i read one interview where she was being interviewed at her studio and the reporter was being givin a lesson via a tv segment all about her method . when asked if this was all burr did to keep in shape , she replied `` pretty much '' sounded like a vague answer to me , the interviewer asked again later in the segment , so , this is all you need to stay in shape , , once again she answered pretty much , seems to me if you were excited to share your program and sell it , you would say , im in great shape and this is all i do ! i have tired it once and you definately feel it the next day , so we will see . yvonne
