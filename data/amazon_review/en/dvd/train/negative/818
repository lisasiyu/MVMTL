a celebration of hopelessness i give this film one star for the acting , which is often very good . however , the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness , and debase every aspect of lower income , urban people . in all honesty , i 've seen more joy in an african famine . i sat through this film , against my better judgement . still , if you 're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban american misery and frailty , then i recommend `` a streetcar named desire '' , `` kids '' , `` last exit to brooklyn '' , and `` traffic '' .
