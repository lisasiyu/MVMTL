one of the most overrated films of all time . the best thing about this tiresome mess is the stunning cinematography and scorsese 's knowledge of new york personalities . but the film utterly fails to capture the magnetism of boxing in its heyday , or provide a fascinating insight into a driven contender from the streets . from the all-too-obvious movie references to the overweening sentimentality , scorsese tries to make an elia kazan-esque masterpiece and fails miserably . deniro 's performance as lamotta is a lot of what we would see from him in later years -- monomaniacal mumbling , zero charisma ; an almost self-congratulatory exercise in the excesses of dramaturgy . who was jake la motta ? why was he this way ? what was his background ? what did he hope to achieve ? on the criterion laserdisc of this film , la motta himself in three minutes gives more insight into these things than scorsese and schrader 's drama does in over two hours . to me , that 's bad filmaking . i have heard from film snobs that much of raging bull 's fascination lies in the significance it holds in the oevre of scorsese . he had just failed miserably with new york , new york and this was almost a religious purging of his soul . i suppose if you want to read into it , be my guest . i consider that self-absorption . i have also heard the patronizing `` it 's funny '' angle regarding lamotta . i do not think this was scorsese 's intention and i do not find the serious issue of spousal abuse very funny
