oh , sorry , i must have been snoring . the butcher ( edward gorsuch , 2006 ) and here we have , yes , another young-and-beautifuls-go-to-an-old-scary-house-and-get-massacred movie . bad acting . increasingly-common variation on old horror movie rule ( instead of straight kids having sex , there 's a pair of lesbians , who must , of course , suffer gruesome ends -- this is n't a spoiler , as the first occurs in the extended opening scene . so the lesbian must die even before they encounter the guy who does the massacring . silly , anyone ? ) . awful , awful script . incredibly predictable plot twist . yeah , there 's really nothing good to say about this movie . some wag on the imdb boards called it ( forgive my paraphrasing ) a bad remake of the texas chainsaw massacre combined with a bad remake of the people under the stairs , and he 's right .
