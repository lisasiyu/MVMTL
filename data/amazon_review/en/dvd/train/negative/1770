absolutely the worst wwii oriented movie ever made . i had to type this review to hopefully prevent others from making the mistake of buying or watching this `` movie . '' to all the intellectually enlighted who gave it positive and glowing reviews , i can only say you must also like yoko ono music and abstract art . this is not a war movie or a social commentary whatsoever , it 's garbage . i read the book years ago and thought the book was kinda ' goofy , but the movie 's off-the-chart bad . if you want to watch a kid have sex with ladies , watch people vomit , watch the seemingly constant need to urinate in glorious color just about everywhere every five minutes , and listen to a kid scream a lot for no apparent reason , then get his father killed , also seemingly for no good reason , this is your movie . oh , and let 's not forget the decapitated horse head filled with eels - man , coulda ' lived without that image all day . overall , worst movie ever made dealing with the third reich . if you want an excellent older german anti-war movie which actually makes sense , buy `` the bridge '' , which i can not believe has not been remade by a major studio yet .
