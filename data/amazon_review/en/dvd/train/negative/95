quack , quack ! `` the hospital '' as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience . it is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one . i was a fan of paddy chayefsky 's `` network '' and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness . i 'm led to believe that chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole . if george c.scott 's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he 's not brooding , drinking , or contemplating suicide he 's off on some rant ? diana rigg is completely wasted in this film . her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by scott 's character . the film is also not helped by the lead-footed direction of arthur hiller . the medical profession can be lampooned but do n't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film
