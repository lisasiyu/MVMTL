hahaha once again in fantasyland we go with fake `` gangstas '' .p diddo or diddity , pifily poof what ever his name is this week.this movie is not worth the price of the plastic used to make it.the established italian mobsters would not put a black or puerto rican on equel footing.these guys would not share the same area in the joint.ridiculous ! ! ! when it comes to true gangsters there are serious racial/ethnic barriers.that is just the facts.as much as the mass media tries to rewrite history it still doesnt change it
