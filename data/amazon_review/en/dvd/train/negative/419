repeat : this is not ruby cairo ! `` deception '' is the edited version of `` ruby cairo , '' which is not a great movie but which is better than this one . it is n't just the sex scene that was edited out , but a total of about 20 minutes . the movie makes more sense in the rc version , and the sex scene , though dark and in andie 's case a bit airbrushed , is worth seeing , especially if you are a viggo mortensen fan . i do n't think it was the nudity andie objected to , though , or not entirely . the scene ends in an act of contempt that would sting any woman . it effectively lets you know what the man 's character is really thinking , but it 's brutal in a subtle way . there is also , of course , the ( apparent ) age difference between the two characters . he looks about 10 years younger than she does , even with a beard
