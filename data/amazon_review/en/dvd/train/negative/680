bad spot on dvd we rec 'd the splash dvd and were quite a way into viewing it when it just went digital garbage -- all our other dvd 's seem to work alright and we have a laser disk cleaner and try to run it through regularly -- i already threw away the container -- we will run the cleaner thru again and see if it clears up the problem - this is the first time we 've bought a dvd that had a problem - we 've always been very satisfied with the amazon service -- and products as well . thanks for asking pgammon
