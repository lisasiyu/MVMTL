was almost decent until ... .. they introduced the red tape . uhmmm that made the whole movie null and void for me . after that it just seemed like a very drawn out veronica mars `` halloween '' episode . *spoilers* this film is about evil spirits who have a vendetta against pc 's , cellphones , and pda 's . god forbid you own either or else you will be visited by one of these beings . forget about being killed on the spot . it just makes you so depressed you want to commit suicide or better yet you turn into what looks like remnants of an ashtray . oh but wait , theres more you can keep the spirits at bay w/ red electrical tape . sounds preposterous right ? ! well it is . to sum up , this movie was a hot `` thrown together at the last minute '' mess .
