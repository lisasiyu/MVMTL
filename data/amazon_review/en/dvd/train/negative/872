it 's a snore i am a proclaimed lover of musicals and movie musicals and i was incredibly disappointed by gigi . as if the overdone french accents are n't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced . the one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect , however for me that might have been the worst part . the songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head . the moral of this story is , spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this on
