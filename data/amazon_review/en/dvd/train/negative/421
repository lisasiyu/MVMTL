torture to watch i hate to trash on an american classic ... but this was truly horrible . i thought my son would like this due to the flying car . it took hours of torture to get to that scene . horrible , horrible film . mindless , drawn-out banter , and weak story line . our copy eventually broke ( stepped on ? ) -- - we felt sooo lucky to have it gone . `` one star '' seems like a generous rating
