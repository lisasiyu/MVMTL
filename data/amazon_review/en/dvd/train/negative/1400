only 5 mins of alvin lee/ten years after ! ! ? ? ..whats all that about ? i 'm putting this crap on ebay first chance i get , i 'm totally disgusted at the editing , not because of how it was edited at the time of original release , but because they have not extended the songs to there original length . ten years after 's 'i cant keep from crying ' with extended guitar solo from alvin lee , was nearly 20 minuites long and they put barely 5 minuites of it on here . this could have been made into an extended package , like most reissued/remastered concert footage has been . there is little enough footage of ten years after & alvin lee out there , yet jethro tull 's full isle of wight 'full ' 1 hour set has been released on dvd . nice remastering , shame about the footage .
