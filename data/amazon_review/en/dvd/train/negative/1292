why did i buy this trash ? poltegeist is the worst dvd set that i ever purchased . the plots are the most ridiculous and amateurish that i have ever encountered . characters have no clear delineation , they hover over any terrain that the writers hoist on them . contradictions and sheer lunacy are admitted into the script if the story demands it . characters who are sceptical one minute , suddenly swing wildly into occult belief full of knowledge of mystical arcana . the actors try to make this schmaltz work , however , at times their faces , confused at the blatant absurdity of the script , collapse into pseudo profound baffoonery . ludicrous coincidences dominate the plot to such an extent that you can not even expel didainful laughter . this show is not even a `` turkey '' because the sheer stupidity of the script elicits revulsion of such a sharp quality that you can only dream of smashing the dvd 's with a hammer to eleviate the loathing that overwhelms your mind while wasting your life watching this dross . this show is so awful , i could n't give it away as a present for the justified fear that the recipient would promptly end our dear friendship due to the insult of unloading this manure to their dwelling . ugh ! avoid this show like the pox .
