skewed perspectives , great if you are determined to hate wal-mart i watched this movie with no particular bias about wal-mart . i understand this movie is made in the same way political ads are , where they try really hard to skew the facts to make the viewer have an emotional reaction to the half of the story that is provided . i think that for most people it is highly effective , but it did n't work for me . i think this is an excellent movie to show as an example of skew , perspective , and propaganda . when they talk about the sweatshops in china and honduras i found myself -- though i dont envy the workers -- laughing at the movie . i used to live in china and i have been to many factories and the conditions that they make seem exclusive are universal over there . it is the film makers and then the ex-employees ( and they are assuming the viewers ) who are putting their cultural assumptions about how sad it is that they work so hard and get paid so little , but in other countries that is a fact of life that has nothing to do with wal-mart . that is a cultural and governmental problem within the countries where the factories exist , not only a problem with wal-mart . the movie also discuss how wal-mart employees are a burden to the government because of the fact that wal-mart pays very little and then suggests that it 's employess go on public assitance , but the truth is that is the same for the fast-food companies and everywhere else that pays minimum wage and offers little benefits . i do believe wal-mart should morally proivide their employees with more wages and provide more full-time positions , but that is a business culture that expands well past wal-mart . i am a teacher who can not work more than 17 hours a week so they do not have to give me benefits , but i do n't see anyone trying to make movies to ban schools .
