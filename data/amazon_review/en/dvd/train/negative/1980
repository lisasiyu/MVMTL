stay away from that monkey okay , i 've discovered the worst director ever , bar none . i 've watched three of hollywood b-movie veteran director jean yarbrough recently ( the brute man , the over-the-hill gang , and now hillbillys in a haunted house ) and this is one bad-nasty awful director . othg was a criminal waste of a veteran cast of character actors heading rapidly towards the sunset . brute man was exploitation unleavened with insight or humanity . hillbillys in a haunted house is hick humor for those who find don knotts ' movies too difficult to follow . these films are monuments to blown opportunities , stagnant and unimaginative direction , comedy that makes us groan and horror that makes us laugh . avoid the scenes with basil rathbone if at all possible . it 's apparent he 'd suffered a stroke prior to this movie and his distinct enunciation is noticeably slurred , making it difficult for a fan to watch . about the only highlights here are when the country music stars ( ferlin husky and merle haggard , especially ) strap on the guitars and sing .
