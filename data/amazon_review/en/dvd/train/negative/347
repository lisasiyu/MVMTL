one star for violence -- five stars for heroism i `` enjoyed '' viewing this film and seeing `` the good guy '' win . but , `` there must be a better way '' to resolve conflicts , `` a better way '' to punish bad guys , `` a better way to deal with evil '' than just go out and kill everyone involved ! we live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in iraq and the sunnis killing the shiites and vice versa , etc..etc . i always believe there must be `` a better way '' besides everyone killing the other guys . so , that 's what i have against this film . as for the film itself , i enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of clint eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast . it is a `` good film '' except for the violence . and , yes , `` the good guy '' does win in the end -- -i 'm happy about that ! and , i enjoyed the photography also . so , yes , definitely see the film but as you do , could you possibly think of `` a better way '' for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film ? email : boland7214 @ aol
