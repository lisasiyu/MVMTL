lame i am a huge fan of the books and had been very excited to see this film when it came out . unfortunately , i was horribly disappointed . the acting was terrible , elements of the story were changed ( i know , it ca n't be 100 % true to the book , but this was a massacre ) , and the characters were ruined ( c'mon , they made the movie version mr. tumnus seem just a tad bit ... um ... creepy ) . they turned aslan into nothing more than a poorly animated talking lion . seriously , go read the books and do n't waste your time on this film .
