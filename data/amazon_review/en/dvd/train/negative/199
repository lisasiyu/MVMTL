ouch let me start by saying that i love indipendent features and support them fully . a movie like this threatens my support . the actors ( i use that term loosly ) are just dreadful and don`t have any emotion . the `` dreadful sex scene `` is only dreadful in the fact that they wasted good film to shoot it . the sfx are passable and the story is just a retread . do not waste your time with this . i have to seriously question the reviewer that speaks so fondly for his love of zombie features . it reads exactly like the review that is quoted on the case . if you want to see how good indipendent features can be purchase van bebbers the manson family or the upcoming actress apocolpse .
