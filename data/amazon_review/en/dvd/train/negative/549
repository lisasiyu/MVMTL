how this movie got so many good reviews is beyond me . i like sissy and marissa but holy cow , this movie moved at a snails pace . i almost fell asleep waiting for the gun shot . the story is so typical girl with two kids looking for some sap to help her out so she picks a naive high school grad . pulls some smooth sex moves on the poor kid and gets his pee-pee all in a whirl and he becomes king kong and wants to protect her from her `` horrible '' estranged hubby , and play daddy to her brats . its a no win situation , legally he 's an `` adult '' so mom and dad ca n't forbid him from diddling with the tramp and unfortunatly he 's in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets killed for no good reason . and she ends up going back to her estranged hubbby and thinks what he did to get her back was soooo romantic . the world is full of dumb c -- ts and even dumber men . do n't bother with this one
