i love miss marple , but these dvd 's do n't do her justice.. i watched all the miss marple 's as my mother & amp ; i are big fans of agatha christie 's many books . i watched the series when it ran years ago , and was looking forward with great anticiption to the dvd 's . i must say this is the worst job of transferring a beautifully produced television series to dvd . there were so many artifacts from cramming everything onto single disks that they are in many cases , completely unviewable . i would recommend renting this set from netflix or somewhere before purchasing them . this is such a major disappointment . i loved the series and waited with great anticipation for their release , only to discover they 're unwatchable
