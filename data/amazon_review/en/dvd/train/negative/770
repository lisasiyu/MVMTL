walt disney would never have put his name on this . `` the wild '' is under the `` walt disney pictures '' banner , and even rated g , so i expected it to be a picture for the whole family , of which the studio is proud . i hoped it would put me in the disney mood prior to our family trip to walt disney world . disappointed am i . it 's mediocre and has just about nothing in common with the walt disney legacy . to be sure , it is not unusually offensive ( the way the usually superb ron howard offended me with his witless and crude destruction of `` dr. seuss 's how the grinch stole christmas '' ) . it is just irritating and amateurish in its writing and direction . for those of you who know something about animation , has no one informed the director `` spaz '' ( his self-chosen moniker ) or any of the animators the concept of the `` hold '' ? a `` hold '' in animation is when the movement stops for a moment to emphasize an expression or an attitude or a gesture . it is priceless when used well ( and gives the animator a few frames worth of a break , besides ) . perhaps the all time masters of the hold in animation are chuck jones ( think of wile e. coyote and the road runner ) , tex avery , and bob clampett during the golden age of warner brothers cartoons . `` the wild '' has a total of zero holds . everyone and everything is moving twenty-four times every second from movie 's beginning to end . who can watch that ? my eyes just could n't take it . the attitudes and gestures were all there . they were just there ten times more often than any human mind could process . but that could be forgiven if the story was clever , conveyed a meaningful theme and was told with clarity , drama , and humor . instead of clarity , every sentence of dialogue was written to sound ironic or sarcastic or `` funny '' or `` witty , '' never actually achieving real humor or wit . it 's hard to know what any character really wants if they never express themselves clearly and simply . ( i suppose once in a while they did , but that was the exception . ) there is no attempt to make the squirrel 's romantic crush remotely believable , and the father-son theme is trite as can be . finally , there is so much slapstick violence ( characters get hurt a lot ) that i almost question the g rating . it 's a valid rating but the film is definitely too full of scares ( like the far superior `` the incredibles '' ) for anyone under age 7 . ( this is not new in the disney tradition , as `` snow white '' , `` bambi '' , `` sleeping beauty '' and maybe `` peter pan '' are also too intense for the very young ) . there is no less artistry required to make a kid 's comedy animation than any adult movie . in fact , more awareness of one 's all-ages audience is required to make it entertaining and meaningful rather than irritating , boring or traumatizing . the theme of `` the wild '' , trite as it is , has potential value but it 's ineffectively communicated . i think `` spaz '' and his crew believed they had a film so full of roll-on-the-floor belly-laughs it would excuse the flimsiness of the story . unfortunately they were mistaken . this was not a pixar movie if you did n't figure that out yet . the good news is , pixar is back in business with disney and we can look forward to their consistently superior material , which has already started with `` cars ''
