oh no ... it finally happened . leslie nielsen in a bad parody ! i am a big leslie nielsen fan . i first saw him in the naked gun series , which i thought was awesome , then i saw him again in wrongfully accused . i was so enthralled that i acquired airplane , which seems to be a highly praised movie with him in it . i had thought he could do no wrong , but he really disappointed me here . what is wrong with this movie ? everything you will see in here are things you have already seen in other leslie nielsen comedy movies . there are times that what will happen becomes so obvious that it 's painful rather than funny . for example , the x-ray glasses . my god , when that was mentioned , i just felt nauseous . the problem with this movie is that it continues the naked gun-variety humor , but it does it rather badly . most of the humor in this movie is sexual-based and that will eventually get boring . aside from that , this movie lacks a proper plot . all throughout the movie , it does n't seem like dick steele ( nielsen ) did anything , but move from one area to another in preparation for a gag . nielsen 's other movies had bad plots too , but at least they were coherent . i am sorry ( mostly to myself for seeing this ) , but this was just a bad movie . perhaps the director should go watch the entire naked gun series to see how it is done
