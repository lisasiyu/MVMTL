black christmas is just a goofy gory version when bob clark gave us the original back in the 75 and threw a young margot kidder in as a boozing sorority sister who along with the rest are being terrorized by a killer living upstairs in the attic his intentions were to give us a scary movie and not much blood.as a result it worked for the most part.oh before i forget , rest in peace bob clark.he died at 67 in a head on which also killed his son last week.this version directed by glen morgan brings gore and eye balls popping out every chance he gets.hey there 's even a scene where an icicle falls off the roof and pierces through andrea martin head.its laughable ! she would of had a better death if she let the killer did it.the acting is so-so but nothing worth noting.they 're spoiled girls and very vulgar when they speak.you 'll probably do what i did after a while and root for the killer
