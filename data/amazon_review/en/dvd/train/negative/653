fun interviews , but no song shown in entirety cheap trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today . they have such great stage charisma , top notch talent , and they consistently get better with age ! what other band sounds better 30 years later ? after my disappointment with the special one cd , i was excited to hear about this dvd ; i heard most special one songs live , and could n't understand why they translated to tape poorly . having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out . and the songs do sound much better now , such tremendous intensity robin has live , the guitars and bass sound great , and there 's a great build up to the climax of each song . however , what 's really the downer about this dvd is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track , you then get 2/3 of each live song . not a single song appears here in its entirety . it 's like a behind the music ( without drama or drugs ) based around a new live show . the banter is great , but this clip-show format kills the replay value of this disc . the closest comparison i can give is the 2-dvd version of silver , how the second dvd has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs . that 's exactly what this is like , however , you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show . bonus features are fun , with the band and their families visiting japan , although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety . perhaps someday we 'll get the budakan show on dvd or an updated every trick in the book dvd . update 6/14/05 : exactly a year later , i 've still yet to pop this into my dvd player for a second watch , and cheap trick 's still my favorite band .
