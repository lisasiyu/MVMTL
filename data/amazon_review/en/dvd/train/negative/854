2 whole stars ... i must be in a generous mood like the title says , i 'm being mad generous by giving this movie two stars ... it really deserves none . subspecies is an excellent , 4-part series written and directed by full moon studio 's ted nicholau ( actually , the first three subspecies are allright , but the fourth movie sucks in my opinion ) . however , vampire journals is nothing more than a feeble attempt to portray a different side of the subspecies archetype . the characters , scenes , and acting in subspecies part 1-3 were superb . yet this movie has an insipid plot and the actors are novice at best . the vampire teeth/fangs look horrid on most of the actors , and i was bored for the last 1/3 of the film . essentially , the plot ... if you can even call it that pertains to a vampire named zachary , who wants revenge for unwillingly being turned into what he is . so zachary ( whoever thought to name a supposedly wise and powerful vampire zachary anyway ? ) sets out to destroy an ancient and extremely lame vampire cult headed by ashe , a fledgling of the main antagonist ( radu ) of all the subspecies films . in addition to this , zachary tries to rescue a female pianist named sophia , who has been kidnapped by ashe . because she is a gifted musician ... or something , sophia is being forced by ashe , a fervid music lover , into becoming a vampire as well . really there 's not much else to go into , except that you should definitely not waste your time or your money on this film . so unless you 're a die-hard subspecies fan , or you basically just want to get drunk and have something to make fun of with your friends , try watching subspecies 1-3 because they 're the best you 're gon na get from director ted nicholau
