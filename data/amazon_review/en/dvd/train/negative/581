worst video game movie we rented this movie , knowing it would n't be an oscar winner or anything . i 've seen some bad movies based on video games and comic books , but this took the cake . it was so lame ! we thought it would at least be entertaining ... no luck there . the best part about it was when it ended . what a relief !
