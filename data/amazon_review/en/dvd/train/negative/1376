ultimately disappointing this film had a lot of potential -- interesting premise , compelling characters and a strong cast -- but something keeps it from gelling into a satisfying story . there 's a flatness to the film that is probably the fault of the director . the above-average cast , that includes the wonderful bonnie hunt , michael learned and several other very likable young actors , seems squandered somehow by a lackluster dialogue and unrelenting low key tone . the redemption that this viewer wanted to see emerge from the script at the conclusion did n't quite make it . a pity as , despite the film 's continuing weaknesses , i wanted more than melancholy for its lead characters .
