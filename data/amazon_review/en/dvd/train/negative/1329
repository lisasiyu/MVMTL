what ? ? ? ? ? ? ? this movie definitely had the potential to be gteat , the action scenes are pretty good . but the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes . the final fight did't work for me either , and the very last scene i thought was pretty unnecessary . did anyone really remember joey wong was in this movie by the time that the end came . the commentary on the dvd was one of the better ones that i have heard from ric meyers
