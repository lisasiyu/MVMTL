disappointed i was very disappointed in this video , keb-mo was good , but there was very little of him playing , actually there was very little playing by anyone . the interviews were fine , but you find yourself waiting for the music to start , and when it did , it did n't last.it is alright , not great by any means , i would be hard pressed to buy it for more than a couple dollars
