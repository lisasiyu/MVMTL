michael moore shoots himself in the foot as usual , michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours . theres alot of great stuff here ( the interview w marilyn manson , the interview w trey parker , & c ) , but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling , no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston . i agree with many , nay most of moores politics -- but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution .
