absolute garbage zero stars , but that isnt an option ... -so lets say , `` f '' for effort ... let me start by saying i love the horror/gore genre , but junk like this needs to be put to an end ... at some point enough has got to be enough ... this `` movie '' was shot using a canon xl ( at best ) ... apparently film was out of the question ... the acting is miserable , the camera work and lighting was a joke ... and the violence and gore was laughable ... and i dont mean laughable like outrageous ... but laughable because it is that bad ... hack editing ruins every death scene ... the only real gore comes in the form of various characters spitting gallons of blood after altercations ... the highlight of the `` movie '' was a dude putting a melon on this dude head and then shooting a 9mm through it ... as if things couldnt get any worse ... these clowns didnt take the time to sync the dialogue to the lip motions ... avoid this at all costs ... you have been warned..
