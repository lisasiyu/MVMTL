why oh why ? let me start by saying the first movie of the series was absolutely fantastic . regardless of the fact that it did n't stick with a few key plotlines in the book , everyone still did a great job adapting the original jurassic park . then came this piece of trash ... whereas the first movie at least attempted to loosely base itself on the book , this one just takes the brilliant writing of michael chrichton and throws it directly out the window . first off , john hammond is supposed to be dead . he dies at the end of the first novel . secondly ian malcome is supposedly dead , or at least mia at the end of the first book , and we join him in a costarican hospital in the opening of the 2nd . there is no bratty daughter , and the entire premise has much more to it . most importantly ... the entire ending in san diego with the t-rex ... which was possibly the worst conceived plot line in the history of movies ... did not exist in the book ! i went into this movie expecting a tightly woven plot , a huge concentration on the conspiracy of having such an island exist , and the anticipation of some good dino-scenes to top it off . what i ended up getting was the writing equivalent of a monkey at a typewriter drooling on a page . not only that ... but because of the lack of plot , the dino scenes are complete over-kill . when you see so much of it , you lose that awe and wonder of the first film . when you see that brachiosaur in the first 20 mins of the original film , the wonderment is difficult to rival . there are no such moments in this film . if you 're looking for a quick fix for decent looking dino fx , go nuts . however , if you 're looking for something more substantial with an actual plotline , flick off the dvd player and pick up the book . oh and one more thing ... do n't go near the 3rd movie . they did n't even have a book to be untrue to . i ca n't imagine how much more long-winded and rambling my review would be for that one
