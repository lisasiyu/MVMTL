confusing , too many characters , difficult to follow story line simply put : the movie is boring . clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together . it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary . the main plot is very thin ( a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince , gets caught and then warns the prince ( why ? ) ) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting . so , a kid dies , which results in the `` natural '' response of the father : freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son 's death . the lawyer has a drunk `` friend '' and keeps him around , why , no one knows . some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship . all in all , this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while . i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged . i neither laughed nor cried , i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause . it meant nothing to me , which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie . save your money , save your time , choose another movie .
