wow ... i wish there was a way to give this a rating below one star , because this movie certainly does n't deserve any . i 'm a sixteen-year-old highschool junior and i know for a fact that i could write a better script than this . please do n't waste your money . as the person who reveiwed this before me said , watch this only to make fun of the bad acting . oh , and for the record , you can actually hear the director yelling `` cut ! '' at the end of one of the scenes
