the rock and vaughn stole the show thankfully i watched this movie having recorded it on my dvr so i could fast forward through most of the scenes with uma thurman and john travolta . their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie . besides , this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it . as usual , uma 's acting is simply dreadful . i tend to avoid any movie with her in it because i know it will be bad . how she became a `` star '' in hollywood is beyond me . she is not attractive nor can she act . she could have been replaced by a nobody and it would n't have changed the movie one bit . i think when they need an actress who does n't mind playing drivel roles , they call her . john travolta is not much better . his version of `` cool '' just does n't do it for me . his diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that i hate to hear him speak . and someone please tell uma and john that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so . the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars is because of the rock and vince vaughn . their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie . i never grew tired of vaughn pimping and the rock primping . while i fast forwarded through uma and travolta 's scenes , i tended to rewind during rock 's and vaughn 's scenes ; they were so funny i had to see them again . cedric the entertainer was also pretty good .
