i turned it off half way through . michael moore can be really funny at times , but most people should not take this goofball too seriously . about half way through 'the big one ' , i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going . what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick ? this is not one of his better films
