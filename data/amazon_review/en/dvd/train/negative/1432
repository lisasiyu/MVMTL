a big disappointment after reading the 5 star review on this dvd i purchased it hoping that if it even came close to this recommendation i would be overjoyed . anyone if even faintly familier with classical piano has heard of rubinstein who is certainly considered one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century . unfortunately he is not one of the great actors of the 20th century and this staged production done , i 'm guessing for tv or the schoolroom , is truly pathetic . the film is dark and grainey and the fidelity is awful . i know this was made in 1953 so what should i expect ? better than this . there are some wonderful classical performances on dvd with supberb audio and video so maybe i 'm spoiled . if your looking for a great recording of rubinstein buy the phillips great pianists of the 20th century 2 cd set . you wo n't be disappointed .
