ok for british sex ed vid on aids , other than that ... . i found this video to be a real snoozer . while the title `` my first time '' suggests a sexy look at guy 's first experiences , nothing could be farther from the truth . this video is best suited as a high school sex-ed video dealing with to how to protect you from sexually transmitted diseases . while it is true that the information presented is accurate and valid , if i knew that sex ed is what this video preached about ( i.e . how to use a condom ) , i would have passed . this video is produced in england , and for an american , the accents can be distracting . my recommendation is if you are a virgin and know nothing about gay sex , get this video . if you know the ropes , pass on this one
