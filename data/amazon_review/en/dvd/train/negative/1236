if you really want to know something about the blues scorcese is not your guy . this review covers disk one only . scorcese is a great director no doubt . he 's also presented some fantastic clips from the period . but his understanding of the blues is so warped by the search for authentic african origins that you have to wonder whether he 's ever read anything about the subject . an unintentionally hilarious classic of clueless romanticism . reminded me of another italian-american director 's tribute to the cult of phony authenticity , the corleone village scenes in godfather i and ii .
