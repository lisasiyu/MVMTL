chilling little satire although the script was written in the mid-1980s , `` bob roberts '' does n't feel dated . instead it feels like it was written today about the current state of american politics . the title character , bob , is a conservative folk singer who runs for the u.s. senate , but the cynical political machinations easily belong to politicians of any stripe . what struck me after watching this movie was how easily lead and deluded we are as citizens . while i thought that the message of the movie was right on target , i did n't care as much for the mock documentary style of the film . it kept me at a distance from the characters and , as a result , i did n't care as much about them as i might have done
