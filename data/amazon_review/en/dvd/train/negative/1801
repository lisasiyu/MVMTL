could have been a great movie i waited in angst to see this movie when it came out on hbo . i love the rat pack and could n't wait to hear the music . i thought the cast was excellent . the problem was the music for sinatra , was n't sinatra singing . the result obviously for a fan is pure dissapointment to say the least . maybe people who do n't realize this will like the film and rate it 5 stars . like i said ... could have been a great movie , it just was n't . you ca n't blame the actors . who are great ! who would n't want to have played these parts
