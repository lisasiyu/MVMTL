disappointment ! i liked vin diesel despite riddick and thought that he can be a good action star . unfortunately , this movie at the very least did n't demonstrate his acting abilities ( unless you consider looking tough as an acting skill ) . grunted , the movie does n't help . it is badly written , badly directed . overall , mediocre b-movie .
