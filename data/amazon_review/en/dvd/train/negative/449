typical action film ; 1.5 stars an air force pilot [ ice-t ] fakes his own death only to resurface as the partner of a deadly latin american arms dealer [ andrew divoff ] . when a stealth gets stolen and it 's used to target the military , it 's up to one man [ costas mandylor ] to stop him before it 's too late . one thing that ca n't be denied is that this movie is boring . the action is not worth watching , the script is dumb , and the story just gets tiring after a while . ernie hudson 's acting talents are once again wasted in another low-rent direct-to-video film . if you like ice-t and wan na see one of his more recent films , save your money and rent or buy ''out kold '' .
