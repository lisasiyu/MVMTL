an incoherent let down after an amazing season 3 culminated in tragically hopeless catastrophe , i had such high hopes for season 4 . episodes 1 - 6 are dark and interesting , but season 7 is the beginning of the downward spiral . none of the characters are likable or interesting after that point . the story line was leaden . after growing into a self-less champion for good in season 3 , cordelia acts like a depraved moron until she is revealed to be little more than a body suit for a dark force ... except it takes *far* too many episodes to reveal this . much of the final 15 episodes are made up by long , boring , circular talks between cordelia and connor ( yawn ) . in the words of buffy : `` alright ! i get it - you 're evil ! '' the blah blah oedipal/modred weirdness of the whole season is just not appealing or well-written enough to be intellectually stimulating . would that cordelia had never come back for season 4 , because it 's just too awful that her sassy-yet-big-hearted self was nowhere to be found . connor and the cordy-suit have a baby - a goddess figure named jasmine ... who is kind of like a cross between lafawnda from napoleon dynamite and a new age yoga instructor . a full five episodes are filled with long , dull scenes of people being adoring acolytes of this unimpressive villain . connor 's character does n't develop ... period . sorry folks , but he does n't get gone until the final scene of the final episode . in a word , blah . some good stuff : the gang releases angelus for interrogation purposes and he goes postal , of course . it 's well-played by boreanaz and highly entertaining ( oh , and angel 's hair is slightly shorter and darker , which is a nice change ) . faith returns for a few episodes , the best of which is orpheus . faith and angelus share flashbacks of angel 's good deeds ( `` dude , you just saved a puppy ! `` ) , while guest star willow works to restore angel 's soul and give guidance to floundering wesley .
