okay , but very techincal if you are looking for video of actual bomb tests , this video is not for you . it is basically actual d.o.d reels declassified . it shows many in-depth testing measuring blast waves , heat etc . good if you are of the sceintific nature , but gets a little boring if you are just looking for some 'action '
