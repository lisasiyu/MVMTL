outlaw all post-release editing . this is truly one the most spectacular films ever made , not suffering for having been made during the silent era . however , as correctly stated by another review of the film , the dvd version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the vhs 155mins . this is not due to dvd faster frame rate , but rather because the dvd version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason . at one point , the hero ( fairbanks ) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree , the next minute he is seen explaining to her ( in an intimate scene ) that he is not what he seems . having seen the vhs a number of times , i can confirm that the dvd version has been brutally cut . do not buy the dvd version , as it is a let-down with those scenes missing ; thus the reason for my one star , which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 ( 5 stars with the rimsky korsakov soundtrack ) . you have been warned
