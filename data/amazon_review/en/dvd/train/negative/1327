should not have had the same title as original when i heard that timecop had a sequl coming out i couldnt wait to see it . then i found out it wasnt john claude vanne damme . why bother making a sequl with no returning cast members ? especially the star . vanne damme is replaced by jason scott lee ( jungle book ) as the hero who travels through time to prposly change things around here and there . i saw reveiwa that this was a movie for sci fi geeks to enjoy . i didnt see much on the sci fi side apart from time travel , but it makes me wonder why they didnt just name it something else and make a seperate movie instead of calling it a second installment to a great movie
