warning ! spoiler : the irony of the disney world view disney does it again ! they manage to turn two beautiful , compelling books into a story of squabbling american adolescents . i find it supremely ironic that disney felt it necessary to turn a murderous troop of marxist guerrillas into a murderous , greedy mining agent - this from one of the most devouring , money-hungry corporations in the history of capitalism ! did they perhaps believe that depicting a troop of black soldiers ruthlessly slaughtering the boy 's family would n't be as politically correct ( or as comprehensible to a pre-teen or early teen audience ) as showing a greedy white mining agent ruthlessly slaughtering the boy 's family ? of course , francois joubert simply has to be transformed into the obnoxious harry winslow ( to make the movie more appealing to an american audience ) . and must every story involving young people of opposite sexes be turned into a `` girls are stupid ! - boys are stupider ! - i love you ! - i love you too ! '' tale of teenage battle of the sexes turned to love ? it 's been many years since i read the novels , but i do n't remember that particular twist to the story , perhaps because van der post was n't necessarily writing for the 11-14-year-old american market . if you 're at all disenchanted with the world as mickey sees ( and sanitizes ) it , skip the movie and read the books ( `` a story like the wind '' and `` a far off place '' )
