something gets lost in translation i recently rented this movie , having never seen it before . i 'm wondering what all the kudo 's were for . denuve was pretty and had a boyfriend who was interested in her . why did she lock herself in that ratty apartment ? did she have a history of mental illness ? if she did n't like being alone why did n't she go with her sister or visit her parents for the weekend . we 're never told . i was confused and bored . what a let down
