okay i agree with david thomson when he says few audiences in the west would be content to view an american epic composed solely of battles and their contexts . kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the west was entrenched with `` kagemusha '' and `` ran '' , he knew what ( american ) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about `` historical '' japan : kurosawa 's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what americans ( or westerners ) imagine about japan . he was not popular in japan ( where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded , hence the suicide attempt ) . i am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no `` ugly '' shot in either `` ran '' or `` kag '' - merely that there are more `` authentically japanese '' films out there to choose from .
