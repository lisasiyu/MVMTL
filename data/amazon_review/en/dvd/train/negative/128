dull and boring . this 'trick ' should refund your money ... like most indie gay themed movies , `` trick '' had quite a bit of buzz around it . a terrific movie with tori spelling ! how could i not love it ? i loved `` die mommy , die ! `` , `` girls will be girls '' , and `` jeffrey '' . so i got ta love this too , right ? right ? ? i found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality . a hot go-go boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb ? uh ... why ? ? so they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy . and then it 's one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans . as much as i ca n't stand tori spelling 's `` acting '' , she 's the only performer not phoning it in . ( maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots ? ) what little life there is in this movie , it owes it to her . the problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking . the `` sizzling '' dancer looked like bored monkey . and the soft , sensitive gabriel has no personality . why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery . i guess if go-go boy dropped the zero and found another guy ( which would n't be too much of an effort for him ) , there would n't be much of a movie . a cameo by miss coco peru is a nice treat . but she 's lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish , you 'd think she was in a different movie . high expectations , very low gratification . honestly , skip it
