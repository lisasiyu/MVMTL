a good first yoga dvd ... .for someone else ! i consider myself a beginner yogi ( have been to about 5-7 classes over the past year ) , and i found this video to be extremely unchallenging . this video might be good for someone recovering from an injury and who has never tried yoga before . although sara ivanhoe comes off as a friendly , non-threatening gym buddy , i just could n't overcome the total lack of breath awareness that seems to be a basic part of yoga . also , i am not in very good shape , and i did n't even break a sweat during the 'fat burning ' workout .
