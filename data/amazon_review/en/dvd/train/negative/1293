only in a very dry desert this movie has some excellent acting , starting with the always wonderful michael caine , and some very funny moments , but it lacks one important ingredient : a script . the story beings promisingly and then just slowly evaporates . worth watching if you are an inveterate caine fan or feel nostalgic about that caribbean island you visited .
