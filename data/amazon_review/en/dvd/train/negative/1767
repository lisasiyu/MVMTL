not the real deal ! if you sre looking for the anime style little mermaid , the one with the sad ending , please note that this is not it ! now i havent seen this film but i 'm sure it 's fine lust not the one most people are looking for . the origanal in dvd format has a realy stupid cover but some nice person gave a few captures so i am sure that it 's the one you 're looking for . the cover is mainly blue with a blond haired mermaide who looks nouthing like merina playing with some fish . the titel on the top of the page reads 'the little mermaid ( uav corporation ) ( 2000 ) ' and if you look at the extra pics someone put up and reed the revews you 'll not make the mistake of buying the wrong film . hope this helps good luch
