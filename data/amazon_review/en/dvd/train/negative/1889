did i miss something ? ? ? i saw this a few nights ago on regular late night tv , so maybe it was edited to death and i missed all the interesting parts ? ? ? ? all i know is that it seemed highly unbelievable ... spoilers follow ... . ( ... why does the rapist just walk in her front door ... would you leave your door unlocked if you had just been attacked and the rapist had your driver 's license ? ! ! ) anyways ... i could n't get past that part through the whole movie , so maybe that 's what made me hate it . i do have to give kudos to farah fawcett though , her acting was excellent and seemed very genuine ... maybe she has been through some similar trauma in real life ?
