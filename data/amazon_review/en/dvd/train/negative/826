boring with bad cinematography i just read _the davinci code_ in less than 2 days . i could n't put it down . it was fascinating . then , i put this dvd on and everyone in my family fell asleep ! i tried to keep them interested and have the dvd help explain some of the underlying theories that i found so interesting in dan brown 's book , but the `` expert '' interviews were sloppy and not engaging . when i switched to the extras , hoping to get some visuals on the sites mentioned in the book , the glimpses of westminster abbey and the louvre were very brief while the rosslyn church segment made me nauseous with all the spinning camera work . i wish they would have held still a little bit and let us look at the place ! i have seen many good documentaries in my life , but this is definitely not one of them
