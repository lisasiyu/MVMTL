`` no-laughs-for-us c.h.o . '' i 'm a cho fan , and consider `` i 'm the one that i want '' to be just about the best stand-up act ever made ... if you like cho , you definitely have to see that one , her first release . this second one is quite possibly the worst stand-up act ever made . the lady definitely goes to extremes . where to begin ? the lighting is poor , she looks like she 's had a few too many , her jokes are stale reruns , and she 's just plain off . i do n't know what happened here , but she obviously does not understand the concept of quality control . i made a special trip to atlanta to see this one , being a big fan , and this is one of the ticket purchases that finally made me resolve never again to buy movie tickets and just wait until things come out on dvd and i can rent them cheaply . because , most movies are crap ! two stars instead of one because of probably misguided and irrelevant residual gratitude left over from her first stand-up dvd
