a good show ... if you can stand to watch it after a year-and-a-half wait for the corrected version ( the first run had major technical issues ) to be released in the u.s. , i finally got to sit down and watch this latest live dvd from the world 's greatest metal band ever . man , was i ever disappointed . i had heard bits here and there about how people did n't like how ( maiden bassist ) steve harris had edited the footage , but ordinarily i find it 's never as bad as people make it out to be . i was wrong . it 's that bad . the whole concert is put together with a rapid-fire pace that might be cool for a video single , but not for an entire live show . no shot is ever held for more than 2 or 3 seconds , except between songs . if you have the cd 's you know this is iron maiden in their finest live form , but on the dvd you 'd never know to look at them , because you can barely see them . the bonus stuff on disc 3 is pretty good if you 're a maiden diehard like me , but nothing new , really . all in all , buy the cd , stay away from the dvd , and join me in waiting not-so-patiently for a dvd release of live after death , maiden england and live at donington
