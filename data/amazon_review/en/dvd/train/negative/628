oh my , what an inexcusable fiasco from universal ! when i received this for christmas the year of its release , i was unaware of the framing issues . i had to ship parts 2 and 3 back to them for replacements . on top of that , there were warbling sound issues with part 2 , and the michael j . fox interview ran about 8 chapters before kicking you off and back to the main menu . ( this was reported on many websites ) also , the trailers were all full screen , not widescreen . apparently all of these issues have been fixed in the 2005 re-release . the thing that angers me the most is that since i couldnt return part 1 to universal initially , ive got a disc with the trailer in fullscreen instead of widescreen ... .ughhhh . i can live with it in fullscreen and i am not gon na exchange the set for a 2005 set because who knows what more crap ill have to go through with universal . thanks for nothing ... ... pass this one up until its reissued with new features !
