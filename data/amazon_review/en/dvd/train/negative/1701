why was this movie set in wisconsin ? i usually like romantic comedies , but this one was for the birds . maybe the robin , our state bird here in wisconsin . then again , maybe not , since this movie seemed to get all the wisconsin stuff wrong . people outside on thanksgiving in just long sleeves ? not where i live . i mean , they could have chosen from about ten other midwestern states if all they wanted was that 'naive farm girl meets big-city boy ' feel ( which is lame and predictable , by the way ) . i like julia stiles , and the young man was okay , but getting the local stuff wrong was a turnoff , and it really kind of took me out of the movie . tsk tsk .
