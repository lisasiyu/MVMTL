`` rocky '' meets `` an officer and a gentleman '' earns a split decision 2 1/2 stars . there is nothing original in this story about a young man who is a disappointment to his father , has a problem with authority figures , and has yet to find his place in the world . the plot is predictable from beginning to end and so cliche-ridden it will make your teeth ache . james franco has good screen presence and he can act , although he is limited . tyrese gibson on the other hand is totally unbelievable in his role as franco 's antagonist . he simply always looks like he 's acting the entire time . his character is n't even defined well and his reasons for going after franco 's character lacks sincerity and believability . the direction and writing is just all over the place in this film that is n't sure what it want to be , so it tries very hard to be everything . it wants to be a basic training kind of film a la `` g.i . jane '' while also trying to be a sports film with its boxing substory . it wants to introduce us to the world of a first class naval academy while also trying to tell us how naval vessels are built . it throws in everything else from race relations to father and son psycho-babble . i was waiting for the kitchen sink to be thrown in for good measure . the film was okay overall when all was said and done . i had some fun with it and franco is fun to watch . it was n't as bad as i thought it might be , but it was glaringly not as good as it could have been . while viewing this film one is liable to keep saying , `` if they only did this '' or `` if they had only done that . '' that leaves a bad taste in one 's mouth
