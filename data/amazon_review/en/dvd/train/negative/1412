average movie i am not sure why people write the story of the movie in their reviews instead of actually writing a review . this movie is neither good nor bad ; the acting is good in most parts but overall this is a normal movie in terms of story and sript . to compare it to `` run lola run '' is unfair and if you are interested in watching more movies along the lines of human psychology i would recommend `` cube '' .
