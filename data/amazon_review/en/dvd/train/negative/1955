d-tv ... no , it 's certainly not as good as the first one , but i did enjoy some of demons 2 . the beginning is cool enough , with the demon 's resurrection and it 's gaining access into sally 's apartment via the tv set . the tension and dread seem to build quite nicely . that is , right up to the scene where the kid-demon 's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic , rubber demon puppet ! ugg ! it reminded me of those stupid monsters in ghoulies , hobgoblin , or some other wretched '80s mess ! the apartment building setting was interesting , but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few , precious bursts of action we actually get . i did like the weightlifter folks in the gym . they were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders ! the battle in the parking garage was ok too . maybe i just expected d2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing ...
