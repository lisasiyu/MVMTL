blah , blah , blah ... this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen . its not sad . its not funny , jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage . i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie , because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him . the actor is the worst of all . i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens , or angry or jest retarded . i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks , i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present . it probably worked better back in 96 ' . but this movie is so so so bad . its embarrassing . do not rent it or buy it or view it on television . note 's : this film had some great talent a song from olivia newton jon , and ( one of my most personal favorites ) mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho . she 's to good but ... why this film , she ( and mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this .
