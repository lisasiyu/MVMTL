excellent film , horrible dvd ! buena vista ( the company that releases disney films on dvd ) chose to not release anamorphic dvds when they first came to dvd , so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced . this means , if you have a widescreen television , you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture . also , these discs are absolutely barebones , only featuring a dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation . where are the extras ? ! i do n't know about you guys , but i am a mighty duck fan who is disappointed by the dvd release of this film
