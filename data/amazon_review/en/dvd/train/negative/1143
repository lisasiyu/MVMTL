awful dvd - will be seeking refund this review is about the regular edition dvd , not the criterion one . the dvd is a piece of garbage . it claims to be widescreen , but it is not . it is encoded at a fullscreen dvd ratio with letterboxes . not only does this waste space , but it gives the picture actually a smaller resolution than it should have as a dvd . i would n't be surprised if they took a pan & scan print and chopped off the top and bottom , like the back to the future box set fiasco . i will be comparing to my friend 's copy he taped off tv to see if it is so
