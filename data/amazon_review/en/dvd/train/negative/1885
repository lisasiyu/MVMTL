do not embarrass yourself by watching this apparantly my first review was censored by amazon , so here goes again . this movie is , by far , the worst film i 've ever tried to watch . i say 'tried ' because after two separate attempts i couldnt bear to watch more than half of the film . this is coming from someone who gave eraserhead 5 stars , so take this as a very bad sign . long story short , andre is self-absorbed and does nothing but talk endlessly about insignificant , flaky , artsy stuff . for example , imagine the most self-important art major you 've ever met talking about how hot-gluing scraps of trash to a canvas represents the struggle a ham sandwich about to be eaten . or anything completely nonsensical such as that , that is the level of conversation these men have in this film . i watched this movie because it was compared to a scene in linklater 's waking life ( which was intelligent and thought-provoking ) . if you pay the absurd amount of money they are asking for this dvd , there is something wrong with you
