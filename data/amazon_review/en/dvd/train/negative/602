children should beware of strangers approaching in cinema because some of them are repeat motion picture pedophiles , of a sort ; or they exhibit repeat youth stalking and posturing behaviors indicating a suggestive or manipulative inducement scam of industrially applied psychological warfare to goad uninformed youth imprinting boobytraps . that is the subject of this semiotic critical study . you know where the exit is if you 're not up for it . voting buttons are for political circuses , state your own case and leave others unmolested . the first amendment is ratified ; it is not up for repeal . enter : there is no more need for obsequiously flattering supplications to a menace lurking in our communities , nor the hundredth re-written version of a content synopsis -- those forms of reviewing anything are passï¿½ mental laziness playing right into a trap . there is no such thing as an american idol or icon or celebrity worship . there is commerce , enticement , inducement and stupidity ; and absolutely no curriculum allowed in the schools dealing with the subject of anti-commercial thinking skills for intellectual self preservation and defense . if leni rifle'nall , subsequent to the destruction of european fascism and its motion picture cameras , had to work under cover still trying to cast the ideological mold for society in the socialistic-fascist agenda , she 'd probably be pushed into film projects that use stories and situations in juxtaposition to target children and other sore nerves like mother 's and kidnapping ... `the forgotten . ' and she 'd probably be in a position of unannounced executive , overriding film directorate to even suggest such crypto-fascists titles ; or what would convert into having the ear of those controlling the pool of her pre-selected film scripts and directors in whatever kulture of mass entertainment media manufacture . poor animation , bereft of ideas and recycling a lunatic zoo escapade from earlier motion picture non-greatness ; for the purpose of catholic bashing and youth corruption . ecstatic performances are actually religion related catharsis , for motion picture redundancy it only amounts to acting out the most , screaming , shouting the most , being the most behaviorally intimating of instability or violence -- that whole center of attention , infant terrible prestige and again , involving a `childish fascination with aircraft ' , motorcycles , airlines like in `the forgotten ' , childhood affectations of wealth , intellect and power . what about this latest ripoff of the movie 'dog day afternoon ' , also having to import limes and posture a sublime disrespect for black law enforcement as being at no recognizable `pay grade ' ? that 's an awfully irritating display of arrogance too , and saying that robbing banks and shooting people is determined solely by the ripe attitude `because i can ' . the public only sees another rotten lime , ( tv 's `` hell 's kitchen '' ) , in a marvelous artistic achievement for public good , peace and civility -- let 's give her a hand , to retirement . bait unrest , bait contempt , weaken morale , trigger something , anything . it can still get them while they 're young and dumb ; ai n't that right columbine ? after school special animation fantasy ? what is the correct genre for this film ? because it did n't work and whatever interesting acting ( at least ) there might 've been , it 's probably a tool for creating the next cipher army of cybernetic john hinkleys . was it on the larry king interview there was rumor of a film titled `amanda plummer ' ? or was that a decidedly misleading invention to hide the catholic bash in `the secret lives of altar boys ? ' well , we 've heard about the scandal surrounding the secret lives of alter boys , but maybe we do n't really appreciate how secret their associations can be . i guess a substantial career in propaganda speaks for itself and only provides test cases for subversion analysis in hazardous media , appliances of mass population psychological operations . and that is actually more entertaining that viewing any movie completely prone to its presumptive spin-aplomb . it is n't a big , important celebrity ; it is n't a big exciting new picture release ; it is n't even a story or film making , it is a method of conditioned response inducement ... for statistical confidence interval estimator ... neurolinguistic , demographic psychometric programming -- exotically scientific and childishly deviant . that 's probably all that the master kulture ultra section of military intelligence , or `` mi '' ever amounted to -- the hubris of hitler 's photography harlot , and no doubt whole schools of socialistic engineering , just like that childish fascination with aircraft raid on the national budget , absolutely every infernal contraption to stroke the ego of super-genius design engineers with all sorts of flight plan ( s ) . what next , with tens of thousands of high school students failing their graduation exams in every state , not just california ; wo n't the white ethnic esteem have but few historic priding tokens to defend its `superiority ' ? wo n't the college republicans at utah state university toy with students of international and family origins due to their non-anglo ethnic and language attributes , by inviting them to write an essay justifying scholarship monies set aside for them ? of course this is happening in america . it appears the trustees of the edifice have abandoned their little writing-contest darlings at usu , and then encourage them to slander and humiliate people of color in lily white logan utah . sociologically , the roots of cinematic agitation for white aggression can always be traced back to the weakness to not examine the fault that lies within the self , and not others ; to spurn the so called `immigrants ' and question the need to recognize their languages , or to complain about the provisions they have made for their children 's education . motion pictures plied to a chronic genre of population demoralization are an indicator of national subversion for political agendas . when they manipulate a context of youth development , they are also trying to strike at more susceptible , programmable victims . glamorization of violence , mayhem , crime-spree destruction is no more acceptable in video gaming entertainment that they are at the movies , ( it 's been done till it 's being overdone sticks out like the sore thumb it is ) . boycott such movies , burn your copy of them instead of the flag for the evening news cameras ; be more critically selective of the means to protest so that it does n't ring hollow . procure movie bills , big and fancy , and symbolically destroy them , even make movies of those effigies and put them on the web . fight back . evict the deliriously self infatuated , patrician media cast and all its pseudo sophisticated , mundane messages of inhumanity . they are destroying america , any way they can .
