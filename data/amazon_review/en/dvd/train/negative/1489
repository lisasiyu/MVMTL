not great i wanted to see a romantic and touching movie . this movie is contrived . the character that reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie . personally , i do n't find his behavior to be romantic . he seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him . this is not romantic to most women nowadays . he is not suave in the role he is playing . it seems like a cheesy 70 's contrived romance that does a bad job of it
