here 's the awful truth this is the perfect show for politically illiterate liberals who need a celebrity to reinforce their trendy , pre-packaged beliefs . sure , this series bears some [ contrived ] humor ; how convenient that renders it invunerable to criticism . do n't get me wrong , i 'm not some regressive conservative who , with a red face , watched fahrenheit 9/11 and decided to slur michael moore because of his fabricated `` misrepresentations and untruths . '' i guess i 'm writing this because i had the misfortune of seeing `` the awful truth , '' and i feel i need to get this off my chest or it will bore itself into my mind until i have an aneurysm . ( if i had an aneurysm , i 'd definitely make sure my dead body ends up up the shamu tank at sea world . at least i could warp some kids ' minds in the process of dying . ) every episode is literally like , `` awful fact of the day : some obscure , skewed study shows that americans are dumb and like explosions and i 'm michael moore an attention-starved clownboat ! '' seriously , it 's interesting moore critiques `` american indulgence '' when he thought having a television show for that kind of pseudo-racist content was alright . - thus says the pellingto
