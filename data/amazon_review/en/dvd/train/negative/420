what time is it ? when prince decided to embrace r & b and eschew rock and roll in his original compositions , he became just another act , imho . his work from 1999 up through sign o ' the times was nothing short of genius , but for some reason he decided to turn his attention away from groundbreaking , genre-busting work and concentrate more on being a run-of-the-mill r & b and funk revue - complete with dance troupe and annoying horn section . this is prince vegas-afied . he 's become a caricature of his former self . listen to his older stuff like `` ballad of dorothy parker '' or `` lady cab driver '' and compare it to the dreck he 's come out in the 90 's . it 's like night and day . prince dances , sings , plays guitar ( underwhelmingly ) all over this dvd , but it just feels like prince has become a cheap , glitzy version of himself . and the `` jeebus '' stuff gets real ridiculous real quick as well . i 'd love to see prince just strip it down to a four or five piece band ( sans horns ) and get back to being about the music and not the spectacle . he could have been one of the great music stars in history , but he 's decided instead to just be another r & b revue ... shame , really . that said , the time comes to deliver the goods , and kicks his royal badness to the curb with great performances of `` jungle love '' and `` the bird '' . i 'd have rather seen them headline the dvd !
