the magic is n't there this is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times . the owens girls are hereditary witches , any man who loves one is doomed to an early death . there is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion , this requires the sacrifice of a dove . two little girls watch . years later they 're grown up . one leaves to live with her boyfriend . but the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck ( never stand in the middle of a road ) . we see scenes where the neighbor kids yell `` witch '' , as if to symbolize something . sally goes when jillian calls her ; she has a problem with her boyfriend . but sally uses a `` magic potion '' to eliminate the problem . now jillian wants to undo what was done . [ the film began to lose me now , it was n't funny . ] the spell goes awry , they bury their mistake . then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles . later an investigator comes around looking for jimmy . [ the story drags again . ] more scenes follow ; they are not funny or scary or even entertaining . but a scene in the attic will wake you even if you 're snoozing ! they call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of jillian . it seems to work , even if they do n't use the standard issue witches broom . there is a sort of happy ending . sandra and nicole are good actresses , but they ca n't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies i 've ever seen . `` bell , book , and candle '' is a funnier film , `` blair witch '' is a scarier film . this falls between the cracks .
