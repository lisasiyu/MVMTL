eastwood great as always , everything else ... ..eh being a big eastwood fan , i bought this unseen and watched it for the first time last night . eastwood is great , as always , although his cop character in this one displays a little more vulnerability than most of his tough guy roles . locke 's acting is over-the-top and annoying , as always . this is a pretty good action movie , but the ending is ridiculous . after blasting the hell out of this bus , the cops are just going to let eastwood walk up the steps of city hall with a gun tucked into his waistband ? i mean , no one says a word to him . and on top of that , he takes the assistant d.a . hostage and locke 's character shoots the police commissioner dead in front of the entire phoenix police department , and nobody does a damn thing ? are you kidding ? i 'm all for suspending a sense of reality when watching action movies , but give me a break . this ai n't no academy-award winner . eastwood is the only thing saving this turkey
