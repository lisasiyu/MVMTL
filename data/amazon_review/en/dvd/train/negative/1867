not that funny nor that entertaining few sequels live up to the original , and i consider that the case here . picking up where the first movie left of , the action quickly moves as farmer hoggett falls into a well and hurts himself , the wife fails at farming , so she and babe go to the city to find help . horror is what they find , and babe has to rise to the occasion to save the day . the themes and moods of this movie are much different than the first one . whereas the original babe was very lighthearted , with occasional scenes of suspense and thorror , this movie is the opposite . here there are mostly scenes of suspense , with only some lighthearted scenes . the comedy is not that good , but the special effects are a lot better . the overall look of the movie is darker too ; instead of a city with bright greens under a blue sky , we have concrete , roads , and building walls . this reviewer did not like this movie that much , and was disappointed .
