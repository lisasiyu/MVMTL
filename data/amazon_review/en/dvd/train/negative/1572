the documentary presents a biased history ... with the burden of ideological narration , this documentary does not provide an in depth look at the history . it does not provide a fair and unprejudiced look at the events since the interviews are manipulated and edited together with an biased flow , without a good balance of academia and historians involved . we can not get the `` facts '' from different points of view . `` goldberg 's film presents a slanted historical account , according to some viewers who wrote into pbs stations and a scholar who participated in the panel discussion . if you only take one side and report their deaths , it seems like genocide . but of course it was n't that , said justin mccarthy , a professor of history at the university of louisville . mccarthy , who acknowledges holding a minority view , believes goldberg 's film takes a selective snapshot of history and fails to address the deaths of many turks at the hands of armenian militants . `` it was an inhuman , bestial time , he said . there were wide-scale , mutual massacres across eastern and other areas of ( the ottoman empire ) a mutual- extermination kind of war .
