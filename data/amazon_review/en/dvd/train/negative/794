really , truly , awful in the film commentary , director robert altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying , 'i do n't know what it was about but i really liked it . ' ( that 's a paraphrase ) . and i think that 's the key to why this film is so bad : the director did n't know what it was about . the weird , atonal score by gerald busby was an annoyance throughout , often drowning out the dialog . it 's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear , or in a psychological thriller , just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho . only in this film , the creepy music played on and on . that was it . no nuances , no alteration , no variance , no imagination . just the same creepy atonal 'psycho ' music all the time . duvall and spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal . lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time , and dream-like sequences , conveying ... mystery ? suspense ? drama what ? ah..i got it , they convey confusion ! that 's it ! the writer/director was confused ! a waste of talent , and a waste of my time watching it . it is one of those films i watched thinking it had to get better . it did n't .
