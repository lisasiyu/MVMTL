completely skippable our two year old loves the tv shows & his wiggles cds , but he is not interested in this dvd . it is simply songs strung together , with little or no dialog and no plot ( which our child really enjoys , and frankly , makes it easier for me to sit through , strange as that may sound ) . most songs are performed on the same basic set , which is just a sky & clouds background . also , as many reviewers have said , the puppets are terrible . i think they will give me nightmares . they are awful ! !
