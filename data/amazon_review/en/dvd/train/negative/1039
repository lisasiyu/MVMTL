drivel i do n't like to brag , but i 'd like to think that i 'm a pretty good judge of movies and whether they 're good or not . i was n't expecting a blockbuster of a movie , or anything , but my goodness , this movie was awful ! one could ask themselves , `` what 's wrong with this movie ? '' but the answer itself is the very broad question , `` what is n't ? '' ashley judd plays strong , sexy women very well , but she does not convince me when she plays a character whom is heart-broken and borderline desperate . not only is judd 's character not believable , the actual plot pertaining to men behaving like cows who need many `` places '' to plant their seeds is just stupid . there are about a million and a half romantic comedies that are better than this , and i recommend all of them wholeheartedly over this joke of a film . watch a walk to remember instead . although not the best movie ever , it 's a heck of alot better than this drivel
