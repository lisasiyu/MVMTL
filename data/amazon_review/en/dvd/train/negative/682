not for the average dog owner sorry - but this video is not for the average dog owner ! if you identify with the punk rock scene and are looking for an alternative to the standard dog training video then this might work for you . this video shows basic training techniques , but the narrator 's `` voice over '' distracts from the actual training process going on . the korny doggy-do and doggy-do n't skits attempt to show the viewer correct training techniques and obvious training mistakes , but are a waste of time.maybe worth $ 8 but definitely not the $ 22.95 price tag . i would return it if not for amazon 's return policy against returning opened videos
