awful ... . if you want to watch a mad max movie , buy the original because that 's the only one that 's worth it . this was a joke , plain and simple . infact , it couls possibly be the worst film i 've ever had the displeasure to see . the whole 'futuristic ' setting is flawed with cheap and badly made costumes , make up and props such as swords and blades which look plastic . it was obviously made on a show-string budget . the filming and direction is nothing special , the script is terrible and the fight scenes are laughable beyond belief . it certainly appears that no proper training or rehersal went into any of it . and the plot is boring , and the whole film drags on and on ... .
