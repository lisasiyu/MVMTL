a middling collection of will 's `` snl career after pretty much laughing my ( ... ) off while watching `` the best of will ferrell '' , i expected to do the same with `` the best of will ferrell - volume 2 '' . however , when i watched it on tv in july , i was extremely disappointed . outside of a few sketches , i hardly uttered a chuckle . however , when i saw this dvd a few weeks ago , i knew i had to buy it , thinking i might change my opinion . needless to say , it remained the same . `` the best of will ferrell - volume 2 '' is supposed to include sketches featuring some of will 's lesser known recurring characters that failed to make it on the ( 10 million times funnier ) first volume , including rude and incompetent obstertrician dr. beamen , hank of bill braskie 's buddies '' , and ted brogan '' , the 37 - year - old baby . also there are some sketches that feature non - recurring bits . none of these sketches are funny . however , there are a few funny sketches . they are the opening bush sequence , the famed `` wake up and smile '' , `` lovers '' ( though there 's another version of this sketch with the same characters on volume one except it 's with jimmy fallon and drew barrymore and it 's much funnier ) , `` red ships of spain '' ( with will doing his robert goulet impression ) , and `` inside the actors studio '' with kate hudson as drew barrymore ( though the one with alec baldwin as charles nelson reilly on the first edition was much funnier ) . the only other watchable sketch is `` janet reno 's dance party '' , which really only catches fire when she beats up mayor rudolph giulianni . it 's pretty good , but will impersonated reno 13 times , so there are probably better janet reno sketches out there . also , there are many much more funnier characters that did n't appear or only appeared briefly on the first volume that without a doubt should have been included here . i 'm talking about frank henderson ( from the `` get off the shed '' bit ) , david leary ( from `` dog show '' ) , tom wilkinson ( from `` morning latte '' ) , sean patrick flannery ( from the mary katherine gallagher sketches ) , baron nocturna ( from `` goth talk '' ) , don west ( from the `` shopping at home '' sketches ) , and his ted kaczynski and neil diamond ( where 's `` storytellers '' ) impressions . and why not include more culps , spartans , roxbury , `` jeopardy ! `` , harry caray and saddam hussein sketches ? yeah , they were on volume one , but they were truly will 's best ! and as a final gripe , they could have given us at least one of the bush/gore presidential debates sketches . overall , you can say this is a complete abomination , but it is tempting . buy at your own risk and hope that volume three comes out soon and it 's much , much better than this dvd
