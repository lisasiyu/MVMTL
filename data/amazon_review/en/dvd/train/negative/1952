not really vp1 was an astonishingly good representation of the impact of the 1960 's on the next decade ... it had a great car and a good cast ; great soundtrack and good scenery as well as a `` feel '' for what a lot of the usa and its inhabitants were like ( low budget so it used a lot of real people and locales ) . kowalski had tried the straight and narrow and then the crooked and lowdown . he had failed ( not always his fault and did have some successes ... medal of honor , e.g . ) at each ... had suffered the loss of his love , so , all that was left was death . vp2 has the dodge challenger r/t and a vapid , inane plot . what a waste of a great repro/rebuilt classic muscle car ! get vp1 and see if , even after 35 years , it does not hold up ...
