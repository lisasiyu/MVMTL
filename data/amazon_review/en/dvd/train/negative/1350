5 stars for the movie , 1 star for the trick ok , first off everyone knows this is a great movie , but considering how many times it has been re-packaged for dvd over the last 5 years , you know they will be doing the ol ' double dip trick again now that it 's come to blu-ray . this is the first ( blu-ray ) release and , yes , a great price from amazon for sure . i 'd wait for the unrated extended ( 152min ) cut that 's available now for cheap on dvd . be warned if u buy this one , more versions will come
