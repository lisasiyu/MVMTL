we were robbed ! we bought `` the series . '' what we got was season 2 complete ( unless any were originally 2 hours in length ) ; the pilot tv movie mccloud : who killed miss u.s.a. ? bearing the syndication title portrait of a dead girl ; and three 90-minute `` movies '' each compiled subsequent to their original network run by frankensteining two random , unrelated one-hour episodes of the show 's first season - which ran under the umbrella title , 4 in 1 - and cutting each set of two episodes by 30 minutes -- with the result that some guest stars were entirely cut from the mix ! for those studio executives who do n't understand the concept , nostalgia means we want what we remember viewing ... the way it was ... not frankensteined into phony movies . if universal had any integrity at all , they 'd gather that pilot with its original title sequence and the unedited , original 1-hour network versions of these six episodes ... with the 4 in 1 umbrella sequence ... and at least offer to sell this to us in a nice slimcase to replace their careless disc 1 , season 1 . i supposed next we 'll have to beware of columbo and other mystery movie 2-hour episodes being released edited down to 90 minutes to conform ( and yet being sold as `` the complete season !
