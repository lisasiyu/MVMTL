too tricky for me i have jennifer 's crunch salsa dancing dvd , and it was my first dance exercise dvd . i loved it so much i 've been ordering a lot of others and ran across this one by the same instructor . i find the moves too difficult and frustrating . by the time you are close to having one step down , she 's moving onto the next one , and it does n't seem like you get to benefit from the repetitous moves that i enjoy in her crunch video . in that one she started out slow , repepated it several times , then did it real time , and then added another combination the same way . the end result was putting the two combinations together , so basically repeating four moves over and over , doing about six dance routines all together , which was good enough for me . when i do it now , i just go right to real time and ignore the slow start , so i have n't been bored at all . she looks great in this video , but i agree with another review that they do not focus on her feet at all . basically i ended up watching her dance and kept marching in circles . but if i was a good dancer , this would probably be a lot of fun .
