ebert and roper are morans in a another patheic performance , keaton plays a plyawright whose fate seems tied to wither the red sox win the 1986 world series . ebert and roper liked this movie , but most preview audiences did not and there for it is only getting a limited release . it also boasts a rather lame performance by robert domey ( who does the worst christopher walken take-off ever ) . this shows how out of touch movie critics are with the movie going public
