blah ... i liked the other eisenstein movies that i 've watched . alexander nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were american . battleship potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by hollywood . so i thought i would give this one a try . i really wanted to like this movie . it 's about the russian revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick . i could only get to about half way through the movie ( as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where i stop ) . excellent cinematography and music but i could n't watch more of it . way too thick for me
