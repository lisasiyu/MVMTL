pure genius ! ! git-r-done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as larry the cable guy . larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head , but end up doubling you over with laughter . his preformance will definitely torque your brain , so be prepared . there are a couple instances where larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure . one such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun . i was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that larry was just messing with me because we all know girls do n't fart , they do n't even have buttholes . he then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out ever . unless you are an idiot , you know you ca n't look like him without a strict training regiment , nice try larry . he finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti-hillary clinton piece . this was the icing on the cake for me because when i think of intelligent political commentary , i think larry the cable guy ! ! ! !
