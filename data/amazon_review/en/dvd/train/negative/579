feels more like broken glass `` sugar '' is an interesting name for this strange , awkward , ultimately disappointing film starring a couple exceptionally compelling leads . while they carry the film over it 's editing , direction , and story hurdles , they ca n't make up for its unevenness . plus the story is entirely too cliche , and i could n't help thinking it was essentially the same story as `` circuit , '' albeit in a different venue ( except i enjoyed circuit . ) i could n't get into this film . why not ? the story lurches around and you are left to wonder `` why '' and `` how '' altogether too much as things go from awkward to worse . something in the description of this film claims it 's funny . i guess if you think drug addiction and prostitution and life on the streets are funny , then you will get a good laugh out of this . i kept hoping that something would happen and my time investment on this film would be worthwhile . not so much . i 'd recommend `` circuit '' to anybody who might enjoy the falling-for-the-hustler and can-the-hustler-really-love story lines , and i 'd leave this film on the shelf . it 's redeeeming qualities are few
