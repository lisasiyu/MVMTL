this is not & quot ; drunken master & quot ; do n't buy this movie ... this is not drunken master . the two fellas who gave this 5 stars had to be thinking of the real drunken master . i bought this w/o previewing it and saw that jackie chan was n't in the movie at all , it was a crappy movie and then all of a sudden they 'd squeeze in a jackie chan clip out of nowhere . do not buy this movie . do n't make the same mistake that i did . instead , try & quot ; young master & quot ; with subtitles
