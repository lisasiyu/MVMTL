am i looking for something not there ? as the other reviewers make clear , this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who `` ruined '' her . so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation . problem is , having just watched the movie , i am not convinced there is anything below the surface . prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities , the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one , and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy ( as fantasy it is ) . is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility ? not that i can see
