disappointing first of all , for the caliber of actors in this movie , they deserved a better script . michelle pfeifer and peter gallagher are class acts , but really this movie just did not dig deep enough . i have read all the rave reviews of claire danes , as i have read all the raves in the past and i am beside myself . i mean she has mastered the part of the proverbial angst-ridden pouting teenager to a tee . if this is her niche , so be it . the premise of the story is pretty decent -- a man loses his wife in a tragic freak accident and has a hard time moving on . completely understandable . then his annoying sister in law and her equally annoying husband arrive and proceed to berate the poor guy for mooning over a wife that is dead . oh my god , stop the presses . these people had the sensitivity of androids . it would have been nice to see him kick these people out of the house , but then the film would'nt drone on and on , this is a good film for a rainy day . but i expected more
