yet another dvd i got for christmas ! where my gifter managed to get an original and brand new copy of this one i have no idea , the bottomline is that it is now part of my collection and i am here to say what i think of it . it could have been improved . it 's major flaw other than the relatively crude animation is the characters , rather unlikeable heroes and hilarious villains that you strongly wish would win in the end since they are more likeable than those known as heroes . the story does n't change much from scene to scene , 15 dalmatian puppies have been kidnapped and must find their way home by going from place to place avoiding cruella devil and her henchmen . recommended ? not really , it has it 's moments of warmth , but otherwise , it is n't one of disney 's greatest films
