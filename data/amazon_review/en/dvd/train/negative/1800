appalling i waited to receive this copy from the us , and when i checked it out it was very bad quality.thick of the worst video you have , and i think you can understand.i certainly wo n't be buying anything off this studio again.i do recommend dvds from red sun , hong kong legends and vengeance video are ok . the film is a masterpiece of classic kung fu , but the quality is dire.i hope red sun release it
