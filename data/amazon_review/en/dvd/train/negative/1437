not for beginners , or anyone else attempting difficult poses , even modified versions , is a sure-fire way to discourage beginners from the practice , or make them feel inadequate , which is not what yoga should cultivate . even as an intermediate yoga practicioner , i did not like this tape , primarily because it throws you into the difficult poses without first generating sufficient heat in the body . the warm-up poses are minimal , static , and do not prepare your body sufficiently for the extensions and compressions of the advanced postures that follow . besides all that , the instruction goes from excrutiating detail to not enough information ( you have to break concentration and look to see what 's going on ) in the course of a single series of poses . very frustrating . as if that were n't bad enough , the instructor 's amazing flexibility is about the only inspiring aspect of the tape ; her monotone delivery and the spare studio setting with no students make for a no fun experience
