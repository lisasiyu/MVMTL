disapointed found this presentation very poor . after reading many of his books prior to seeing him deliver this speech , i was a greatly disappointed . it was a mumbled fumbled repetitive delivery with the most important facts obfusicated with a line like -i think you all know what im referring to here . i suggest read his books they are much better structured and more to the point . i give this dvd one star and repeat- read his books ! dont be lazy and expect to get much out of this , i ask myself how can he be an mit professor with such poor teaching skills , an off ( ice ) prof ?
