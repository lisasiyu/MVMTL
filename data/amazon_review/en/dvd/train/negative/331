beware 25 years old does not mean it is tame for kids i purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since gone with the wind . give me a break ! this movie had an agenda 25 years ago , and it still comes across that way in 2006 . the rating of pg is a joke . please do not watch this movie with your kids ! it is certainly has a more mature theme than what you would think . the plot is lame and i am sorry i spent the money on it . i plan to get rid of the movie and exchange it as used somewhere where i can get something that is entertaining , this certainly was not . i did not even reach the end of the first disc before turning it off . for top names in the industry making this film , all i can say is they got paid a lot of money for nothing .
