very poor dvd of a wonderful movie this is one of my all-time favorite movies , but i was very disappointed with the dvd version . in the middle of the movie , you will have to get up , go to your dvd player , and flip the dvd over to the second side to see the rest of the movie . i do n't know what bozo came up with that idea , but it defeats the purpose of relaxing and enjoying a good movie . who wants to get up and flip the dvd over in the middle of the suspense ? this format takes stupidity to the next level . i would highly recommend the vhs since i have it and it 's wonderful . i would not recommend the dvd until they do a better version . the packaging is in paper and not durable at all , another truly bad idea . dvd 's should be in plastic cases , not paper
