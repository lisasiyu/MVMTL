the worst pixar movie ever i consider myself a huge pixar fan . this is easily the most insipid pixar movie ever . pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one . i have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie . pixar , if you are listening , please , please , dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c-grade stuff . i expect more from you
