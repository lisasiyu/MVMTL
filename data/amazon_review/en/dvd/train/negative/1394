big giant kiss-up to a terrorist , before he was a mall goth t-shirt besides committing the worst cinematic sin of being boring and self-indulgent , this bromide of a film is an utter distortion of how che guevara developed into a sadistic murderer and rapist . this yawner shows him as a spoiled medical student who helps a leper colony , but does little to explain how he became a power-hungry militant with a notorious reputation for ruthlessness . he established forced labor camps to torture and kill innocent people . in one account , a child in his guerrila unit was immediately shot without trial for having stolen some food . he helped to destroy hundreds of years of a rich cuban culture ( see `` before night falls '' to understand how the castro government stifled free speech and tortured innocent people ) . meanwhile , he was a hypocrite , living in a rich havana estate like the so-called `` capitalist oppressors '' he tried to eradicate . but do n't expect to see that story in this dull , droning film .
