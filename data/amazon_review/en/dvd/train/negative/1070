very poor quality i watched this and would have probably liked it if the people who made this video had taken the time to produce a decent product . the lecture volume swings from low to extremely distorted and at times can not be heard much at all . it was very disappointing considering the price and during the lecture will henry had slides that he presents with use of a laser pointer and you have no idea of what he is really showing to you or pointing to on those slides which are also barely legible on the video . my advice would be to pass on this one it isnt worth the time it takes to watch even if you got it for free .
