worst . movie . ever . ok i have seen a lot of bad movies but this one takes the prize for worst movie ever . i am generally a big fan of 80 's movies , especially 80s high school movies and chick flicks . but this was just so horrendously unfunny , pointless , dull and banal , with unsympathetic , flimsy characters and a weak plot . it tires so hard to be funny and emotional but fails miserably . i mean , the part where she says about how she 's with lloyd because he told her there was glass on the ground is just so artifical and contrived , yet it is supposed to be profound and emotional . i was actually embarassed to return this piece of garbage to the video shop . the two leads have no chemistry whatsoever and i fail to see what on earth john cusack 's character saw in the selfish , stuck up diane . i can not understand how anyone can give this movie a high rating , i can only assume that you 1. have all been smoking crack or 2. are all the same person . thank goodness cameron crowe 's films got better . please , do n't buy this pile of junk if you have any brains ! it will be two hours of you life wasted
