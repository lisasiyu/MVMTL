battle royale ii unfortunately this sequel to the amazing cult classic does n't stack up to the original at all . despite the disappointing movie i was very pleased with the dvd itself . it comes in a well packaged case and there are plenty of extras on the dvd to keep you busy . the product itself was very good , i wish i could say the same for the movie
