extreme something some folks need only a paper-thin plot to string together a bunch of action sequences , without character or theme or language or logic getting in the way . if that 's you , this may be your movie . xtreme sports , xtreme ops . get it ? if that does n't strike you as xtremely clever , you may find this movie painful to watch . i 'm thinking of telling the agony booth about it . the humor does n't work , to the extent that i think i want a laugh track after all . or a drummer doing rim shots . ba-dum-bum ! characters are distinguishable by such things as fake national accent and stereotyped mannerisms , hair style and/or color , or shouting all his dialogue . i did n't watch it all . i did n't even watch enough to tell you what it 's about . amazon or imdb can tell you what it 's about . just something else we found in the flat . someone 's losing credibility as a selector of dvds .
