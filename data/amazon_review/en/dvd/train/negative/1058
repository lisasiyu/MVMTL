fitness seeker while the content of the exercise program is good , the production quality is abysmal . the sound swithces from normal to very echoing , dim and `` under-water '' sounding every third sentence . the visuals flicker , and alternate from color to black and white . the filming is very unsteady , as if the cameraperson is just a beginner . i contacted the company and they sounded very unconcerned about these problems ! because of this , i am reluctant to purchase another living arts-gaiam product
