1 of the 8 films to die for ... out of boredom ! i generally steer clear of low-budget horror in that those films , while trying to be cutting edge , usually smack of just `` trying '' ... too hard . i gave `` the hamiltons '' a go since it received the most hype . was n't impressed . yes , the ending has a nice little twist , and i was intrigued by seeing lenny -- although once the twist happened it was easy to see it coming -- the film lacks dramatic tension , contains mundane dialogue ( victim : `` help me '' ; predator [ whining ] : `` i ca n't ! ) , and characters are pretty much stock caricatures . 86 minutes drrrraggged by .
