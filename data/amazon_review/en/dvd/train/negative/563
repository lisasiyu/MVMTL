if you paid a buck for this , then you paid 99c too much . absolutely do not buy this video . 1 ) the fights are not fights . they are boring and tiresome staged tapping , pushing and pulling matches . nobody wants to hurt anyone , and nobody wants to get hurt . 2 ) jerry springer fights are 10 times better than anything on this video . these girls keep their clothes on , and tussle like 4th grade girls at a sleepover . 3 ) modelfight.com has their name on the box and these girls are not model quality and they do n't fight . 4 ) the most violence these girls can conjure up is to giggle and smile into the camera and say `` you better get out my room ! *smiling* *no , you get out ! * says the other girl while pushing the other girl on the bed . complete waste of time and money . you want chick fights , look elsewhere .
