ridiculous and lame ! `` cursed '' is the most pathetic werewolf movie i 've seen since `` an american werewolf in paris '' . the acting is terrible , directing is poor ( shame on you mr. craven ) and the storyline is largely uncompelling . the werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience . this movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is `` cool '' , but if you 're looking for a scary movie , do n't look for `` cursed '' . well , at least it 's not as bad as `` an american werewolf in paris '' , but that sure as hell is n't saying much .
