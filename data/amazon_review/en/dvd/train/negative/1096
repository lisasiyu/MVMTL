bad movie this vile , pretentious dump of a movie sucks joy out of your life . breillat exhibits no love for humankind . i find something to like in most movies , but breillat has made it onto my small enemies list with this one . not someone i want to be spending my time with . i think the last movie i hated as much as this was `` johnny mnemonic '' . if you do watch it , make sure you have something good on hand to wash the taste out of your mouth . i 'm going for cocteau 's beauty and the beast . singing in the rain would probably be even better . for balance , i will add that there are a couple of scenes which have some human interest to them . but mostly this is a cold , cruel , inhuman flick
