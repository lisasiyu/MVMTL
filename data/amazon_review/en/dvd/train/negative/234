complete waste . . . . . . of about 50 minutes i 'll never get back . the movie is 93 minutes , but around minute 53 i decided i was so bored and did n't care what happened . like another review , i agree that characters were insulting and borderline offensive . not quirky or interesting . they 're acting like people in big cities think people in small towns who work in dollar general type places act and think like that . and did i mention it was boring ? so mind numbingly boring . there are so many more movies that successfully accomplish what i assume this movie was attempting . i ca n't be bothered to think of examples , because i 'm working on regrowing the brain cells i lost watching this
