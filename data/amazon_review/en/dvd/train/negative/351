not my cup of tea i rented this movie because i like luke wilson and i was in the mood for a romantic comedy , but i was very disappointed . there 's just about no chemistry between wilson and kate hudson , and she was just terrible . throughout the entire movie , i could practically see the acting wheels turning in her head -- her portrayal as a somewhat prudish , somewhat mousy character was both unnatural and incredibly annoying . if not for her bad acting , i would have given this movie a higher rating , because it did have its funny and some sweet moments ( if you can ignore the implausible plot ) . there just was n't enough `` good '' to compete with hudson 's `` bad .
