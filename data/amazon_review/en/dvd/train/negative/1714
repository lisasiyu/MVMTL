ted wass is no closeau curse of the pink panther is weakest entry in panther genre . one , peter sellers as chief inspector closeau seem to take the spirit of the panther films to the grave with him two , this was the last film of david niven . the rumor of rich little dubbing his voice rings true , if you watch niven 's lips and what is coming out of them.niven who was very ill with ms just did a lot of sitting and limited movement . three , ted wass tries to bumble and stumble like sellers 's trademark character-however he is no closeau . the more he pratfalls , the most we miss and wish sellers were still alive four , the supporting cast ( robert loggia , herbert lom , leslie ash , robert wagner , joanna lumley , capucine , david niven , harvey korman ) are given almost nothing to do in this film , other than to be a foil to wass 's pratfalls or straight men to wass 's so called craziness . burt kwouk as cato is given more to do in his small scene with wass and you wonder why he isnt in more of the film . and roger moore 's cameo as a remade closeau is poor preformance , playing on seller 's trademark accent and his james bond character five , blake edwards 's script seem a weak closure to the genre . and to make matters worse , he even did another pink panther ( son of the pink panther ) after this , which was worse than this film and those are the good points i give it two stars for the stellar supporting cast alone , that makes this film worth it bennet pomerantz , audioworl
