sleazy and trashy reason to believe has got to be the worst movie i have ever sat through . non of the characters are at all believable and most are morally disgusting . i am no prude but if this movie represents the way college students live today then it is no wonder the world is in such decay . there really is no reason to see this movie . totally disgusting . why well known actors would be involved in such sleazy trash is beyond comprehension ! ! !
