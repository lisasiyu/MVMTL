buyer beware i ordered this on november 2 , and even though amazon have been listing this as being 'in stock ' for a week or so , my order still has n't even shipped yet . i have asked amazon to provide a reason for this , but they have n't done so ... i think it 's terribly misleading of amazon to list something as being 'in stock ' when orders placed two months ago have n't been filled yet . buyer beware ...
