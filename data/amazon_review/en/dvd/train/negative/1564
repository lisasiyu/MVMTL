self adulation never a good thing ! i was such a huge tiesto fan until i saw this dvd . i bought it on the basis of other reviews but i guess i have n't yet joined the cult of p so have missed the point of the dvd . tiesto is a master at what he does there is no doubt about that however after this dvd i have lost some respect for him . i thought from the dvd i would learn a little more about the man eg influences , inspiration etc etc . instead all i got was a dvd that showed yet again that the dj has become greater than the music ( and i wo n't debate the merits or otherwise of that ) and endless shots of ( mostly americans ) going on about how brilliant he is . this dvd is self adulation / promotion at its worst , all i can say is shame on you tiesto making suckers out of your fans
