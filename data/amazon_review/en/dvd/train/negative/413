making a poor film useful in the classroom after reading the novel by jane yolen with my 7th grade classes , i was eager to view the film version . i had heard conflicting views of the film- it 's great , it 's horrible , etc . after viewing it for myself , i must agree with those who gave it negative reviews . however , despite its lack-luster performance , the film did serve a purpose in the classroom . true , the film leaves something to be desired . they change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them . editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story . rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely . major events in the rising action are left out , thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing . overall , very few of my students liked the film adaptation of jane yolen 's novel , which they found so riveting . on a brighter side , because of so many differences , viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice comparison/contrast writing through t-charts and venn diagrams . it also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills . after reading the novel and viewing the film , most of my students agreed that the book was much better- something a reading teacher loves to hear !
