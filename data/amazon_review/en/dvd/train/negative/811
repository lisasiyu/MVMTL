gobbledygook & self-righteousness & pretentious twaddle make for a terrible movie there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound , then they are . the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable `` crash '' , but at least that was ( somewhat ) assuaged by strong performances . this -- arguably the worst `` mainstream '' motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing . an excruciatingly long 2 hours , and as much as i ( usually ) enjoy george clooney , i might never forgive him for this drek
