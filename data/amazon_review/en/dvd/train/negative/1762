i wanted to cut out my eyes this was a bad movie , the acting was horrible , the dialogue was laughable , and some of the action sequences were ridiculous ! especially that one scene where they blantantly & quot ; borrow & quot ; scenes from terminator 2 . it 's insane they use scenes straight from the movie , from when they tried to break into cyberdyne systems . and they did n't even change that name they kept it , cyberdyne systems . it was a very sad thing to see
