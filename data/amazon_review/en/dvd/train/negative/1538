a little nasuating i had avoided this for sometime but finally relented so i could see a young diane lane . she is the only redeeming part of this rather silly movie , not even product placment clips of paul newman and robert redford make it bearable . hideous accents abound and way to many sexual references i.e . statues in the louvre , porno flick to make it really innocent . olivier is really pretty awful , he must have been really hard up for money to support joan plowright and the kids . broderick crawford playing himself is even worse . where did they come up with this cast ? so rent henry v or rebecca for olivier ; all the kings men for crawford ; long hot summer for newman ; the great gatsby or butch cassidy for redford and just say no to a little romance .
