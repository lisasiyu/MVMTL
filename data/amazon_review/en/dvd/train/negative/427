thoroughly predictable `` thriller '' the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life . i found myself saying `` oh come on '' to one plot point after another ( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities ) . the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving ( previous reviews in this thread provide details )
