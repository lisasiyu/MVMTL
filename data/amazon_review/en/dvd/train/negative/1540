doggy-doo this film is as bad as the first howling film was good . the plot is so hackneyed and predictable that you start to pray it will get it over with soon . i understand that the author of the original book was angry that joe dante changed the plot for howling 1 . this film is said to be closer to his original vision . all i can say is thank god that dante altered it . see dante 's original , american werewolf in london , ginger snaps , dog soldiers , underworld , anything but this . it 's an embarassment to cinema
