nothing to marvel over . i wanted to see this film in theaters . i am a cronen fan . i admit . i was n't really a huge fan on viggo mortensen . i never read the book , but somehow i was drawn to this film , indirectly . so , i wait for the dvd . which is n't such a bad dvd as it is a film . firstly , there are no surprises . any surprises this movie could possibly have in store for us was revealed in either the trailer , the dvd cover , or the dvd ad . viggo 's performance as a whole , was n't too shabby . ed harris was obviously the one man shining through this dark and boring movie . so in this small , secluded town tom stall aka 'joey , turns out to save some lives and becomes a hero . although , it turns out tom stall was n't much of a hero as he was a villain . that 's about it . the movie drags it ending around like a dogs rear on the carpet . the sex scenes felt out of place more than anything . i could n't stress that enough . i 'm going to be blunt . they are too random . they are in bad taste . they are uncomfortable . they are very much disliked by me , personally . and finally , the ending . the ending was probably the most empty finish i 've ever witnessed . tom stall goes after his brother , takes care of him , drives back , and sits down for a nice meal with the family . three words . fade to black . i give this movie 2 out of 5 stars . for two reasons . some of the action scenes were interesting , and ed harris . i would not recommend this film
