disney is a joke . disney is a joke and this movie is a joke . i wish i could give it zero stars . why does disney keep instisting on taking these dark , disturbing tales , such as pocahontas , alladin and the huntchback of notre dame ( which , by the way is really notre dame of paris ) and making them into cutsey kids films ? and , oh , lets give it a happy wappy , cutesy wutesy ending . screw that ; this is a dark , sad and disturbing tale and that 's the way this story should be ! what the heck story is disney going to try to adapt as a children 's film next ? the scarlet letter ?
