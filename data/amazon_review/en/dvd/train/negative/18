piracy when i received this dvd , i played it on my imac . when doing this , i discovered that there were chinese characters showing at the top of the screen . the quality of the dvd images were dark and grainy . i reported to amazon that they had unknowlngly sold me a pirated dvd , and i was saddened to not have a response from amazon other than refunding my costs . copyright is not only a law to protect publishers ; it also protects consumers from getting poor quality products . i feel that i can no longer depend on amazon to provide my dvd orders .
