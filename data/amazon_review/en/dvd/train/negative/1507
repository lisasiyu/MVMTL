tsukamoto can do better . much better . i like shinya tsukamoto . he 's a great director ( tokyo fist ) , a talented actor ( ichi the killer ) and an imaginative writer ( tetsuo ) , but i did n't care for a snake of june . it starts out alright with a repressed wife being blackmailed to act out her own sexual fantasies - example : walking around in public in a miniskirt with an active sex toy inside her . that part was interesting , but then it starts going on about her lame husband and i lost interest quick . nowhere near sexy enough or surreal enough to recommend
