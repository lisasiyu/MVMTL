`` the fat nothing '' horrible movie , only worth watching if you are a jayne mansfield or phyllis diller fan . movie looks like it was cheaply filmed and only uses about 4 scenes in entire movie . however , if you like cartoons , than you might like this movie . the singer laurie berger is the funniest when she sings and dances her solo . save your money for a fast food burger .
