enough with the lions ! i completely understand and genuinely enjoy the chinese tradition of the lion dance . it is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer . but this movie , while building to the climactic end scene , has about 500 lions dancing at the end . all of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions , and all the while the viewer is left to be confused . clubfoot was a great addition , but enough with the lions ! ..
