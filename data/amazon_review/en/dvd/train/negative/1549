original is better if you want uncut original version , always look for original licensed production . not us release . its a foreign film , it should not be us version to begin with~ ! hello ! ! ! ? ? why settle for less with us version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with jackie 's fighting scenes . and us release ruins the speed and sound as well . i have been collecting jackie chan 's movies both hk and us release version for quite some time now . i found hk version to be much more in enjoyable , and higher in quality . american market always like to `` americanize '' and `` control '' . regional code regulation thing is one of the example to control the market . why not let everyone enjoy the same hk original release move the same way entire world enjoys it ? ? no one makes hollywood american movies to `` french version '' or `` chinese version '' ~ ! this what americans are doing~ ! well , enjoy the cheap `` american version '' then~ ! lo
