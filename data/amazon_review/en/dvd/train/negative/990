dutch colonial never looked so bad i 've never heard of the `` bell witch '' before , and this movie did n't really get me interested enough to care . donald sutherland and sissy spacek must have needed a payday real bad to appear in this clunker : parts of it are so unintentionally funny that they should cut and spliced into the next `` scary movie '' they make . the director , i guess , did n't realize that a lot of people have seen that movie `` the exorcist '' . ( remember ? with linda blair ? oh yeah ! ) the scene that was bust-a-gut-laugh-till-you-vomit was when the girl is picked up by her hair -- you can actually see a wire or something for a minute -- and dangled in the air . it looked so unbelievably fake that i began to see this more as a comedy than anything else . is the entity so mad that it wants to glue the hair of young girls together ( maybe a deleted scene has her waking up covered in spitballs ) . the ending , however , and what is implied about sutherland 's character is not one bit funny and struck me as unnecessarily morbid ; also , the performances and general plotline before ca n't support an issue as serious as incest or child abuse . i guess at some point this was so obviously a clunker to everyone in the crew that the decision was made to throw something really sick into the plotline . it did n't save the movie . the only creepy scene is the ending .
