melvin should have another serving of paste directors , actors , and all others associated with the film industry make a real effort to be cerebral . it 's understandable , as it 's a worthy goal . 99.5 % of them fail - perhaps it 's a lack of education , maybe it 's poor upbringing that has reinforced self-absorption , and it could be that the superficiality which makes them such a good fit in hollywood directly leads to this end . the only redeeming quality of the film is that it exposes human foibles ( and this is not a new concept - it 's typically an element of every movie ) . it seems that movies these days fall on either end of two extremes : telling stories of people who unrealistically do the right thing , or blathering of shallow morons who are poor subjects of empathy . this falls into the latter category . i want that hour and a half of my life back for a more worthy endeavor such as playing target practice into a trash can with a staple gun .
