not what i thought my father , my friend mandy and i watched this movie last night . we were all very disappointed . we thought the movie was n't realistic . we watched the news and saw all the firefighters and police officers running into the buildings trying to help the people . in this `` movie '' we saw them leisurely walking around , even stopping to have nice conversations with each other about what they thought was happening . we were really disappointed with the search scene . it made the men and women of our country look like quitters because it was getting dark . we were under the impression that they search through the night . at least that 's what we saw on the news . guess we were wrong . all together i would have to say i 'm glad i borrowed this movie from a friend instead of wasting my money buying or renting it
