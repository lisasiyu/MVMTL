not worth watching all `` style '' and no substance . even the dance number with john travolta & uma thurman was lackluster . and would cedric the `` entertainer '' please go away ? i 've never seen anything with him in it that was any good . i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud . i think christina milian 's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over .
