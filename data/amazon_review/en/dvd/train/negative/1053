excellent performance very poor video edit ! ! ! ! ! ! as other have stated , the performance is excellent . my wife and i watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show . with that said , my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did . they used some kind of filter on many of the shots . they change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch . you do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it . additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music . i have to sell my copy because i get nauseas watching it . i hope they re-make this dvd . i think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing ... and we could use the additional revenue stream ...
