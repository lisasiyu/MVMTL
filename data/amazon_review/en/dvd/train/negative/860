van damme fans only ... i struggle with this movie . i 'm a die-hard fan of jean-claude van damme , so part of me really likes this movie . but the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script , uninteresting characters , and horrendously bad acting ( save for jcvd himself ) . having said this , i can honestly reccomend it to fans of van damme . they will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his indian buddy and pickin ' up chicks . if this appeals to you , there should n't be any reason why you would n't like `` desert heat . '' if even one of this does n't sound good , stay far away
