well acted but hardly a classic i found the other reviews very interesting . yes , the movie is very well acted , which is the only reason i gave it 2 stars but frankly the abuse was so horrific i found the movie barely watchable . i admit that when watching a movie i look for something to entertain & escape into . if i want reality , i 'll watch cnn . for that reason , while i know child abuse exists & think it needs to be acknowledged to end it , i do n't really want to watch someone hurt children ( & animals ) . maybe part of the reason i had such a problem with this movie was the fact that everyone talks about what a great children 's movie this is . it 's only appropriate if your idea of a children 's movie is `` friday the 13th '' . the violence is way too intense to let children watch
