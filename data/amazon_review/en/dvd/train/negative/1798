holy women walk with devils well , it 's hell on earth for all of us mere mortals as aion with a bewitched rosette wanders the world healing people and driving mankind into enforcing justice , even if they have to murder those they find guilty of sin ! the magdalene order is strangely relegated to the sidelines in the old `` god does n't interfere with man , so he lets the devil do it ! '' cliche . the whole thing becomes some sado-masochistic dream in which characters are dying left and right but do n't worry , we 're being tested like job fatalism . chrono and azmaria desperately try to track down rosette as satella is locked in a battle with her older sister , whose memory was wiped by aion . sad to say but volume 7 of chrono crusade brings a series that started with a lot of laughter and entertainment to an end filled with sadness and overacting drama . maybe to a japanese audience this theme of making man to suffer as a test is something new , but to christians , it 's all old hat . the humor from the first couple of volumes is also sorely missed with this gloom and doom installment . and another sore point is azmaria 's singing which is supposed to be divine , but just sounds like poorly pronounced english by a japanese singer . the saddest facet of this show is that it never was allowed to achieve its potential .
