what ? being a texas chainsaw fan i of course picked this one up . it has 2 big stars in it , and was directed by one of the writers of the original . i 'm not sure what they were going for in this one . is it a horror , a sick comedy ? it is all over the place . what is worse is that they made leatherface a wimpy crossdresser . the ending leaves you scratching your head . mathew and renee do their best with the material
