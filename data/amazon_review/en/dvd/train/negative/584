amatuer camera man . love michael buble , but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience . parts of michael 's head was cut off , and then ; sometimes , his whole head was cut off . most of the time , the camera man did n't expect where michael was going to move to and you 'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get michael back into the picture . i wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert . that this was just home made videos . this was definitely not worth $ 20 . if you want a professional quality concert , i would recommend buying michael buble 's caught in the act . caught in the act was worth the $ 20 bucks . you get professional camera men who anticipated michael 's movements , and parts of his head was never cut off like come fly with me 's dvd . also , the sound quality on caught in the act was way better . now , i understand why some places sold come fly with me dvd 's and had the word enhanced after it . the dvd that i received was not enhanced . anyways , skip this one , and get `` caught in the act '' instead .
