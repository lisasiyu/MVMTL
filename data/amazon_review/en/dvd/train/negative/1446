faithful but dull this made for tv canadian adaptation of the washington irving story is more faithful than the tim burton movie . ( of the many things that were wrong with tim burton 's version , perhaps the most jarring was the decision to made the headless horseman a real person , when in the book it is clear it is a prank to scare ichabod crane out of the village ) . unfortunately , the fact that this is a faithful version does not necessarily mean that it is an interesting film to watch . in fact , it is pretty dull . the unknown actor portraying crane does n't help a lot , either . ( other actors in the movie are more appealing ) . still , if you have read the original story , you might be interested to watch this version
