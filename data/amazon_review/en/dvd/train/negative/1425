formulaic saturday morning fare if you 're looking for something groundbreaking like b : tas or `` the new batman adventures , '' you 'll have to look elsewhere . `` the batman '' is nothing new . in fact , it 's the kind of saturday morning show you might have seen in the late-80 's . this re-imagining abandons many if not all of the conventions that made the other animated shows great . no longer are the villains multi-layered and complex ; rather they are the standard cardboard cutouts that exist solely for the purpose of fighting the hero . further , batman mythos mainstay james gordon is abandoned in favor of two `` hipper '' more `` kid-friendly '' replacements that serve the same function . on the plus side , the animation is good ; but it is still not enough to make up for the series ' shortcomings . i understand the second season was better , but if so , they must have made some major changes . all in all , a disappointment .
