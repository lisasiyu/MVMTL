politically correct retelling ruins the message . although it looks the same as the hg wells story and the 1960 movie , this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man 's nature into a mildly fun sci-fi outing . alexander 's motivation for building the time machine is entirely different , and what he learns 80,000 years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind ( that is , if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time-travel paradoxes ) . so the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the george pal version . we do n't even find out anything about what we are about to see ! but things get worse is in the distant future . although the writing tries to dance around the fact -- they have de-fanged the harsh reality of the eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete . instead of unknowing sheep , they are new-agey world-culture pluralists . the dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense . and there is no rod taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts . the only reason why i give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci-fi films in years , and i found some of the special fx ( the moon ) and jeremy irons , cheesy as they may have been , fun
