not as advertised i bought this dvd for my collection . i do not buy full screen format dvds . amazon described the dvd as `` anamorphic , closed-captioned , color , dolby , full screen , widescreen , ntsc '' with an aspect ration of 2.35:1 . however , when it arrived , it was full screen only with an aspect ratio of 1:33.1 . consequently , i returned it . my recommendation , if you only want widescreen , do n't believe the description that this dvd is dual-layered and do n't buy it
