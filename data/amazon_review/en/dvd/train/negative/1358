swallow the expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today 's technology . alas- the movie was disappointing . the characters were not developed and the were quite flat . the action starts very soon in the movie ( the wave striking the ship ) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop . the course of the movie did not allow for any significant development . moreover , the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable . for example all the surviving passangers , including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period . it is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable .
