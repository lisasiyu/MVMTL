blade trilogy ending deserves better than this ! ! this movie smacks of sub-par quality . unlike its two predecessors which are far superior , blade iii is plagued with a poor script , an unqualified director ( sorry , david goyer is no director ) , and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace . think godfather iii in the godfather series and you 'll know why to bypass this awful film . this movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the blade character in the first two films . without these attributes , the follow-on action and violence in the film ( an artistic staple in the blade franchise ) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you 'd expect . what you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters ( including snipes 's blade ) who are all dressed up with no where to go . rated or unrated , avoid this dvd at all cost . it is n't worth the money or the effort .
