comments about this dvd although i truly enjoy louie prima 's music , this dvd does not due him justice . the sound and picture quality is poor . the performances are old and all in black & white ! ! the only parts in color are the commentary and the cemetary photo where he is buried . better to just buy a cd and listen to him perform . this dvd is way overpriced for its poor quality . i do not recommend unless you just want anything and everything there is available on louie prima , no matter what the quality is like . i was very disappointed
