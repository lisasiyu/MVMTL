i 'm rating the actual dvd not the movie i love this movie i 've seen it probably more than 100 times ! so imagine how excited i was to see it for like 5 bucks at wal-mart ... . this particular copy is sitting next to me right now and all can say is i was really mad when i sat and watched it , the editing is horrible there are times when the camera zooms on people it should n't , lines are cut out and sometimes there are voices but no one 's lips are moving . buy the authorized version not this one this one sucks
