a curiosity this dvd is a good way to see what houdini looked like . that 's it for the positive side of this review . the story is ridiculous , houdini does no magic and only one escape . that escape is so poorly photographed , however , that it appears as he is doing nothing more than rolling about on the ground to escape the `` wet sheet '' tie that was used in insane asylums at the time . this film flopped at the theatres , and it seems obvious why - this is a vanity piece , ignoring the magic and escapes that made houdini famous
