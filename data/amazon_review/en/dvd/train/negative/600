assess your own taste before buying i am one of the many reviewers who purchased this dvd because everyone favorably compared it with `` seinfeld , '' and ( not being an hbo subscriber ) i had never seen it . personally , i found this show boring , repetitive , and often grating . well , that 's just me . you might be among the many people who enjoy this genre of comedy . deciding if this dvd is for you will require an informed assessment of you own taste . buy this dvd if you tend to laugh at protracted bickering among the characters ( as in `` married with children '' or vicki lawrence 's show `` mama '' ) . this is not the kind of gut-splittingly funny politically charged bickering that we once enjoyed in `` all in the family . '' as in `` seinfeld '' , you will see adults act in childish , selfish , irresponsible , uncaring ways . depending on how this is done , it can be very funny , but `` curb '' missed the mark for me . i find self-absorbed new yorkers ( as those portrayed in seinfeld ) to be funny , but self-absorbed californians ( as in `` curb '' ) are just pathetic , not even laughable . you might feel differently . neurosis and rudeness are backhandedly ridiculed in `` seinfeld '' , but almost celebrated in `` curb . '' the characters in `` seinfeld '' are roughly half a generation younger than those in `` curb . '' the seinfeld characters ( who came of age in the `` me '' era of 1980s ) commit a variety of hilarious middle-age gaffes and mis-steps associated with a lack of direction in life . the older characters in `` curb , '' on the other hand , offer us only a repetitive and uncreative barrage of antagonistic behavior that is characteristic of people who have given up on forging new directions in life . they merely exist . you might find this funny , but i found it depressing
