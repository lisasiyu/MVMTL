starts well , comes crashing down in the early going , i thought the choice was between four and five stars . as the movie progressed , my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four , so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second . the ending was so disappointing that i had to drop my rating to two stars . it is about a polish man in france who marries a french girl but is divorced by her because he is unable to make love to her . he returns to poland without her , manages to get rich , and comes up with a plot to get revenge on his beloved dominique . the problem with this writing is that he loves her , so why is he plotting revenge against her ? it is senseless . the ending is utterly surreal . she should hate him for what he has done to her , but she is smiling to him . he is looking at her and crying . he has betrayed her in a cruel way . he does n't have the right to be crying for her . that is like hitler crying for the jews . he is still in a position to help her out , but he wo n't . it 's really pretty sickening . the story becomes unclear enough as it is , without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss . it left me angrily saying `` what the hell is going on ? '' i really hate it when a director becomes unclear and plays with the audience . i do n't find that cute at all . tell the damn story and tell it clearly . besides , the ending sucks
