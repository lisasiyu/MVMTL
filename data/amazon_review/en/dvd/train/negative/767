do not buy this movie~ worst ever ! this is seriously the worst movie ever . the last time i saw it was in the theater , and i still ca n't get over how bad it was . in fact , it ruined a perfectly good date with a perfectly good guy ... . we did n't speak for six months after we saw it together ! i too wish i could give it no stars ... . and obviously people are n't looking for this movie since the last review was in 2002 ! i ca n't believe you can even buy it on dvd
