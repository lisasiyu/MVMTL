plot is absurd ; acting is fine so : alien civilizations with obviously vastly superior technology travel clear across the galaxy at speeds greater than the speed of light in order to -- well , wo n't give the plot away , but trust me , they 're not here to guests on martha stewart . and i find the plot , therefore , and all of these `` aliens as terror sources '' movies just -- can i say this ? -- not fair to aliens ! ok , i do n't have an aluminum foil hat on , i just think its childish . stephen greer , md 's `` hidden truth '' book suggests that this is the sort of fare we are to get from hollywood -- no more friendly e.t . types , just constantly the message of terror from the skies . this trend in cinema about foreign visitors is now so consistent that it just makes movies like this dull and predictable . and how we eventually beat back the aliens in this movie ? oh , you do n't want to know..
