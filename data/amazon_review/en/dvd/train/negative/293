truly disappointing after i read erik larson 's wonderful book `` the devil in the white city '' i was fascinated by the brief glimpses at holmes ' story . but this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment . the production is amateurish at best , complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of `` mondo carne . '' with such a wealth of fascinating information available ( court transcripts , etc ) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened ? this man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the haunted mansion at disneyland . truly disappointing . perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of holmes . this most certainly is n't it
