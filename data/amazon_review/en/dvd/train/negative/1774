wow ... that was so bad i think i have to die right now ! one good thing about this movie is that it helped me find religion . it was so bad that i actually wrote a prayer : oh great and loving god , take mercy upon this , the lowliest of your creatures . burn my brain , i beseech thee ... yeah with fire , acid , turpentine , and super-hot hot sauce lay waste to the portion of my brain which remembers having viewed `` point blank '' with mickey rourke ! keep me safe and guide my steps far , far from future viewings , so that in thy mercy i might instead feast upon broken glass and burning hot lava , and smear my naked buttox with honey and lay me upon a hill of ants rather than ever see this film again . amen . like many of you , i first came across this little gem while searching for the 1967 masterpiece of funkadelic nihilism starring lee marvin . well , of course that 's not out of dvd yet , but since i 'm a huge fan of mickey rourke ( for reasons which , as his career progresses , i find more and more difficult to remember ) , i thought `` wow , mickey rourke just re-made one of the coolest movies of all time ... might be worth watching . '' boy , was that a mistake ! first of all , this is not a remake of lee marvin/john boorman 's point blank . that 's two strikes against rourke , because he also starred in `` bullet , '' a stupid piece of crap which had nothing to do with steve mcqueen 's `` bullit , '' another of the great guy films of all time . it 's about a bunch of escaped convicts who are really bad and blow some stuff up and are at a mall and mickey rourke kills them . 'nuff said re the plot . one thing that really sticks out about this film is that rourke , typically a pretty muscular dude , is positively steroidal ! i mean , he put on so much muscle for this role that his skin literally looks as if it 's going to fissure and peel off ! i do n't know what he was on , but it must be something we normally use on farm animals
