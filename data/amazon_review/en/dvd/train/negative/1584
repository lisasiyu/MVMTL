2 out of 10 volunteers is a film i wished that i never saw . it is so bad that i was miserable after finishing it . was it supposed to be a comedy or an adventure ? throw in bad jokes . add psychotic john candy . steal the idea of the bridge on the river kwai . what do you have ? i do n't know . the greatest disappointment in this film was john candy . that was n't the definitive john candy that i know . before viewing volunteers , i was expecting tons of crack jokes . after viewing volunteers , what a let down ! the anticipation of boredom was the last thing on my mind . i am gravely disappointed in this film . worst part also is the supposed romance between tom hanks and rita wilson . really , what romance ? i do n't see the chemistry
