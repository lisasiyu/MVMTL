no , thanks . i will not be buying this version . i have no desire to have a cherished christmas classic with it 's cover despoiled by an obnoxious picture of an obnoxious `` musician '' . i will keep searching pre-owned dvd outlets for the previous dvd release of this , the one which has n't been defaced by an ill-concieved marketing gimmick . what were they thinking ? the people who do n't care would have bought this either way , but they 've lost those of us who do care . seems to me like a counter-productive strategy . the people at sony who made this decision should be fired
