over rated underwriten and over acted well i bought this series agaisnst the star rating it has and i can only say that in my humble opinion it is badly written the acting is ham , and the actors of a standard that do not rate on a scale of 1 to 10 and i do not mean they score higher than ten . i can not understand its five star rating as comparing it with other series such as medium , numbers , waking the dead , it should never have got passed the pilot.if i could i would rate it 0 stars.if there is a secound series i will not be buying it .
