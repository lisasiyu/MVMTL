the men who fought for the honor of saving america 's worst actor after its disturbing and frighteningly chaotic opening sequence , this film swiftly degenerates into another typically stupid , arrogant american war film . spielberg is a great director , and deserved praise for the opening sequence alone , but what could he do with a screenplay that is little more than a boring melodrama with stereotypical characters who all die in increasingly gruesome ways . without the massive buckets of blood , why would we want to watch ? this film is not reality , and the fact that it pretends to be reality is offensive to me . hollywood 's god-complex is its undoing . okay lets all pat ourselves on the back one last time for being `` brave '' enough to revel in the glorious bloody pulp of war . in my opinion , this film is like a horror film with a bad plot . imagine having to fight , bleed , and die all kinds of horrific ways for the honor of saving matt freakin ' damon . just thinking about it makes me want to go watch the ending of the departed again . there 's a movie with an ending that will leave you smiling
