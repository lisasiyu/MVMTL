poor video quality i purchased this product to benefit from dvd technology . the reviews on the website led me to believe that this product was somehow updated , or upgraded for use with dvd technology . last winter , i ordered the video , which is is like a pirated version , with very low resolution . if i could , i would return the two dvds i purchased . i feel ripped off and stuck with an inferior product . i love callanetics content . amazon should be urging this company to provide new material . it 's no help to see a sticker on the dvd i purchased announcing new products in dec. 2006 , which is when i purchased two inferior callanetics dvds
