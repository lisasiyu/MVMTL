2 stars for cameos a dull dull movie that perpetuates stereotypes of latinos in the us and abroad . i was very bored with this movie and found the plot to be very insulting . i enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen , but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target , i think it 's just a shame . the whole cast was pretty much of latin america origin , but that did not do much to glorify latinos as capable and deserving actors on the spotlight . the plot and dialogue dehumanizies and insults many .
