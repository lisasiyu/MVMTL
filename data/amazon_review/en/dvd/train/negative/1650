dated and dull uncut magazine from england rated this 5 stars and dvd of the month . they also claimed the coen brothers paid tribute to it big lebowski . this was enough to make me shell out the bucks and buy it . imagine my dissapointment . the picture and sound quality were dire . too much contrast in the video and the sound had to be turned up super loud to follow the dialogue . the movie came across as just another viet vet/counter culture exploitation movie with a trite plot that hardly went anywhere and never engaged me or made me feel any suspense . dialogue was dated and cliched . i 'll never trust an uncut reviewer again . do n't waste your money on this one
