beverly hills cop iii beverly hills cop iii~ eddie murphy is not a terrible movie . then again if you compare this sequel to the two first movies then one must say that it is a disappointment . eddie murphy is not nearly as funny as in the first two movies and the script is half lame as if they had run out of ideas . the plot is paper thin , and a total hoot compared to the two previous movies . man , i was really looking forward to watching this movie after having seen the two other movies . this is a mediocre movie at best and gets the 2 stars that it deserves . not recommended .
