ok , i 'll admit it -- it was fun watching charlton heston drown ... the least of the big 3 of disaster movies ( the others being `` poseidon adventure '' and `` towering inferno '' ) that hit across movie screens in the mid 1970s . the sensurround gimmick obviously doesnt work when seen on tv , the screenplay and acting are pedestrian , and the special effects now look a cut above flash gordon serials .
