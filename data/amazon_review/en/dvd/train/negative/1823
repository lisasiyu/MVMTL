lava is a many splendored thing yep , that 's right ... a volcanic eruption in nyc is the premise for this hokey but mildly diverting disaster flick . seems like nasty doctor michael ironside is trying to develop a source of geothermal energy and doing so he starts a volcanic rift under the big apple . dedicated tunnel worker costas mandylor is the first to discover the lava flow but of course no one believes him . enter alexandra paul as his geologist ex-wife who is called in to find out what 's going on . the fbi is certain it 's the work of terrorists , while a high city official is secretly funding ironside 's experiment . the movie is nowhere as intense as the earlier volcano , as it 's pending doom never seems large scale enough for a good disaster movie , and the effects are n't that impressive . diverting entertainment for fans of the genre
