bizarre and ridiculous rip-off ; a drug-induced nightmare put to film how the film-makers achieved financing to make this film i 'll never understand . the make-up , costuming , screen-writing , directing , acting , cinematography , editing are all over-the-top and way over-done . it looks like an amateur film-school project . nicole kidman is beautiful -- the one bright spot in this film . for some reason , a film set in the late 19th century had the male lead and entire cast break out singing `` the sound of music '' by rodgers and hammerstein . someone must have been smoking something illegal that lead to this manic , ridiculous parody ? of a musical . nowhere did i read a review that said it was a parody and farce ; it was supposed to be a musical . there was no way i could view this film for more than 15 minutes , and that long just to see if the title character would awake from a drug-induced nightmare . i love musicals but this one should definitely be viewed free on television and not rented or bought until you see if you can stand it . save your money -- it is awful . note : if i had read a review such as this , i would have saved myself time and money
