very light on baby care basics this newborn care dvd is strictly for caring for a newborn infant , in other words , what you learn here wo n't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks . my biggest beef with this dvd is that it totally just skims over all the basics , such as how to breastfeed properly , how to bottlefeed properly , how to swaddle properly , how to calm a baby properly , etc . all the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn , each is given about 5 seconds of screen time . instead , the bulk of the program is wasted on things like `` pre-birth preparation , '' which interestingly appears toward the end of the program , and how the mother should take care of herself . these are important things to know , but not for a `` ultimate baby care dvd . '' the dvd packaging is also very misleading . it says `` over an hour of hints '' ... but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of `` you should always consult your doctor '' warning , plus a long end-of-program credit . the actual content is about 55 minutes . i 've seen this dvd and the `` abc of newborn baby care '' dvd and even though the latter is not great , it 's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step , and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly . between the two dvds , i definitely recommend the latter . btw , you can likely find this at your local library . it 's also available from netflix . it 's just not worth the price of the dvd , not even 1/10 of the price
