truly bad there 's absolutely no way anybody with any love for the movies or woody allen could love this really really poor movie . i thought hollywood ending was bad but this is worse ! ! ! if you are a woody allen fan do yourself a favor and stay away from this one ! the man has many a good movies in his filmography this is certainly not one of them ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
