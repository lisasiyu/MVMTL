plunge into oblivion dark descent is about as exciting as watching someone make banana pudding . filmed in czechloslovakia , most of the actors and crew 's names end in `` v '' . which would n't be so bad if they could at least act . dean cain , he of superman fame , bullies his way through the mess , chewing his gum , and wincing after he gets shot in the leg . scott wiper who plays his jealous comrade mercifully disappears once he quits , but the movie never says what happens to him . the movie starts off with cain and wiper ( sounds like a law firm , do n't it ? ) facing some really nasty guys who are obviously attacking the women in this undersea mining plant . nothing is ever explained as to why they are doing this , but cain kills them all but one , a nasty guy who plans revenge . meanwhile , many of the crew members are committing suicide , and cain is investigating . ( excited yet ? ) . of course , it all culminates in a kind of underwater high noon when the bad guy who promised to come back , does so with two other goons , and chase cain around the plant for a while . there is nothing exciting about any of this , as the direction is wooden and the acting abysmal . try the abyss or ghost ship or any other undersea film , and you 'll do much better than this waste of celluloid
