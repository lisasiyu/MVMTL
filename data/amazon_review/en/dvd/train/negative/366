bee boop , boring ! - not for cardio lovers searching through the amazon firm dvd 's , lo and behold ! new ones ! i was very excited to get this . once the dvd arrived , i rushed to play it . it started with a `` boogie/hip hop '' kind of warm-up ... . and kind of stayed there . it just lacked any intensity . now , there was some latin dancing , some disco dancing , and a boogie/hip hop cool down , but nothing to break a sweat with . i would recommend this for someone who is just beginning to work out , or someone out of shape.i was really disappointed , because it was hosted by allie delrio , in my humble opinion the best of the best . her smile was wonderful , following her was easy , but it just lacked that firm energy . plus , the workout cast had only allie and allison . the other folks were people never before seen in firm videos . one lady in the back even did these mini-dip twist things with her knees over her toe box ! ( a huge no-no ) recently , goodtimes video , the company who used to own the firm , was just purchased by gaiam ( the folks behind am/pm yoga ) . if this is what they are doing to the firm , i am going to stick with the old ones i got . i sure hope not-as the owner of 30 firm workouts , i am used to quality and excellence with the firm
