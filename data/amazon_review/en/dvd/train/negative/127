pul-eese . why did they have to make this movie ? i have only one question about this movie . and that is , why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book ? if you have n't read the book than you do n't know what i 'm talking about . but if you have , then you do . i ca n't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would 've been if it had been adapted correctly . half the time while watching this , i felt as if i was watching teletubies or something , the colors were so bright . if this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes , locations , characters , and details from the story , then everyone would love it . not just 5 year olds . it makes me so angry when i watch this movie . yes , its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing . everytime i loan someone the book , i have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all . in fact , it is a hundred times better . more even . i am really disappointed . i just do n't get how gail carson levine would agree to all the changes that were made . if someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie , than i suggest they do it right . and if they do , then i 'll be very thankful . i just do n't get it . the book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better . you would n't believe how much better it is . i am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book . next time , please , please , do it right
