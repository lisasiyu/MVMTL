pointless the first third of the movie consists primarily of guests and hosts of a party greeting each other , and , as such , is unavoidably boring . the second third of the movie features a game of charades , which is embarrassing . the final third of the movie , though often self-indulgently mediocre , does possess some tension and drama , though it 's largely derived from people 's being mean to each other . not my idea of a good time
