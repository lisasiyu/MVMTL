do n't buy this 1-disc release . i bought the japanese 2-disc edition from amazon 's japanese site . the only thing that is in japanese only are the kiddy games everthing else is in english with removable jpn subtitles . the jpn edition is ntsc and region 2 . if you only have a region 1 dvd player try to find a copy of the old tarzan collectors 2-disc edition release
