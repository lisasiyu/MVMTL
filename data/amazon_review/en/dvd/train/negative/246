i 'm just glad i did n't actually pay to watch this ! we checked this out from the library a couple of years ago . it really was torture to watch . the acting was terrible , the costumes were even worse . i do n't know whether to say it was really funny or really sad , because all in all it was a pretty pathetic production . not one of bbc 's better efforts
