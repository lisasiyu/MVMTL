try not to compare it to the book ... . jonathan safran foer 's book is a truly literary work and this movie is not a book . and , as many have already said in amazon 's ratings , this movie is not like foer 's book . it is , unfailingly , cinema and with that in mind it should be judge upon cinematic criteria . thus , although i will grant the impressive visual beauty of this movie ( the cinematographer captures an oddity , serenity , and disturbance ) i can not agree with those who give it high marks . the plot is sparse , as is much of the character development . i am especially disappointed with the portrayal of alex and his grandfather . i found myself empathizing little with the grandfather or alex in the movie 's final dramatic scenes . the grandfather 's emotional turmoil seems underdeveloped as does alex 's reaction to his grandfather 's action . morevover , the parallels between the jsf character and the ukranian characters seem forced . the only things they share are contrived connections in the narrative 's backstory . overall , i felt untouched by this movie . and one last note , why is it even called `` everything is illuminated ? '' that title illuminates little within the movie
