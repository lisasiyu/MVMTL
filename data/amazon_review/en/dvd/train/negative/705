not what i expected i read the only review for this item and ordered it , expecting to see a fantastic display of sound and some of the interaction of these artists with mr hancock as they created music , each colaborating to have a unique blend of sounds . actually this is only a documentary showing this interaction , and as such is very interesting . but if you are looking to see an hear the full length videos of these great colaborations you will be disappointed , that is not included in this dvd . only small samples are there for you to see . this was a real disapointmet because the quality of video and audio are fantastic .
