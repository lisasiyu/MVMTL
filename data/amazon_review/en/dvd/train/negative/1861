crappy dvd that should have been called `` things that make you go ewww ! '' i expected interviews with the band and concert footage , kind of like pink floyd 's `` classic albums : making of dark side of the moon '' dvd . instead , this just has interviews with critics , fans , and people who call themselves `` experts '' on mcr . if something says `` unauthorized '' then do not buy it . hopefully , the black parade album will be better
