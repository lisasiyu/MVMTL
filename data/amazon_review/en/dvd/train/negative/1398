not as good as i remember . zandalee , zandalee , zandalee . where do i start ? well , i watched this movie on cable a couple of times when i was still a child , and i remember it being a good but forbidden movie . i decided to buy the movie before it became obsolete and enjoy a smut classic . but watching it as an adult has shown me one thing : it 's bad in every way . from the bad louisiana accents to the narcotics inspired acting by nicolas cage to the pedestrian acting by ericka alexander to the silly script writing . it 's very bad . even the s/ex scenes are not as good as i remembered : a couple come off as rape scenes , which will always be dangerous considering how many confuse rape with consentual desire already . i guess my changing view about zandalee says a lot about the eyes and mind of a 12 year old versus that of a 25 year old . bottom line : no wonder the film has been conveniently forgotten by those who had anything to do with it
