awful acting i found this dvd real cheap and bought it . i really tried hard to like the movie , but i just could n't because the acting was incredibly bad , especially that of the bad guys causing havoc in the city . even the guys who do n't have lines display bad performances . an hour into this movie you ask yourself why you torture yourself just to watch a bad sequal to a good movie . i broke this dvd and threw it out , something i 've only done to 4-5 dvds i felt needed to disappear off the face of the earth
