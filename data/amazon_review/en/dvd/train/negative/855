`` fox faith '' get a clue peter hartlaub of the san francisco chronicle sums up the film 's lesson like this : `` keep disobeying your parents and eventually you 'll get your way . '' and i agree with him . this film is touted as being christian , is marketed through christian distributors and even comes with a bible study guide . i , however , could not find anything `` chrisitian '' about it other than it was relatively clean..but to me just being relatively clean does not make it christian . i am a christian and i consider a movie as such when it portrays values such as ; respect , honesty , and honoring your parents even when it does n't seem fair . this film does not portray those values . if you just like horses and are looking for a decent film then you may like this one .
