disappointing unfortunately i have to express a degree of disappointment on this film released on dvd . whilest i enjoyed the acting & storyline , i was extremely annoyed on the number of scenes which had been deleted from the main film and shown as additional scenes within the main menu - for what purpose i do n't know - it just seemed to leave gaps in the film which certainly detracted from the enjoyment . i remember seeing this film many years ago and rated it one of rock hudson 's and julie andrew 's most cherished performances - however the deleted scenes really robbed it those memories
