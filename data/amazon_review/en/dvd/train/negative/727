film : 4 stars , dvd : 1 i preface all of my dvd reviews with the following note : there are more than enough film reviews on amazon.com and , quite frankly , it 's a bit ridiculous . a person can scroll through scores/pages of reviews without reading a single sentence about the quality of the dvd . if you want to review or discuss a film , go to imdb . if you 're reviewing the dvd , speak to the qualities ( or lack thereof ) of the audio and video ; mention your opinions of the plot , acting , etc . but please do n't write an essay ! now , on to my review of the ghost and the darkness on dvd . i remember wanting to see this movie when i was younger ( when it was first released ) , but it was n't until my sophomore year of college that i bought the dvd in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history . in terms of hollywood , it 's fairly accurate . the film itself , as entertainment , is great ( it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary ? ? ? ) . i 'm a fan of both douglas and kilmer ; they 're fine here , but they 've definitely done better work elsewhere . the plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense . additionally , the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great , too . now the bad news : the dvd sucks . period . and i 'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here . the transfer is absolutely criminal , and those responsible for it should never work on another dvd project ever again . the print is clear and solid , but the aspect ratio is not correct at all . i was mortified when i popped it into my player , only to be rewarded with a distorted image . absolutely shameful ... this film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio . video : c- audio : a film : b
