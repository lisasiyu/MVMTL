buyers beware this product comes with a fault ! the quality of films presented notwithstanding i feel cheated by the manufacturer/distributor which is time/warner . nowhere in any description do they tell you that this dvd comes with the pretty nasty advertisments in between the shorts that can not be zipped past ! so , as i did not expect commercials for the bmw 's , henry jaglom 's personal phone talks and a few trailers for hollywood schlock : i would definitely avoid any of their similar . too bad because i love short and unusual films
