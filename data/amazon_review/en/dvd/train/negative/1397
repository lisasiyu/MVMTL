i know christy and she 's no christy . . . . to be blunt , laura lee smith 's christy is petulant and immature . i like diane ladd as an actress , but her portrayal of alice henderson is bland . thumbs up to the men -- stewart finaly-mclennan and james waterson . also , dale dickey did a great job with the role of opal mchone and i thought emily perkins and olivia kelly were outstanding as zady spencer and ruby mae ( respectively . the script could have provided a much better transitions in several place . most notably , we see the good-by to one beau . it would have been more emotionally satisfying to see her say `` yes ! '' to the other . while some performances were excellent , the movie must stand on the overall performance of the cast , director and screenwriters . with christy and alice being so central to the story , it simply does n't make it . we all knew who she would end up with , anyway , did n't we ? ? ? much better to go back and watch the cbs series or better yet , read the book !
