give me a break this movie was terrible . even for an indie it was pretty dull . the acting is lousy , and the story is boring . just about the whole movie is about this med student who is obsessed with a cadaver . the script is almost laughable and i actually considered turning it off a couple times . it was a good effort , but i would n't waste my time on this stinker
