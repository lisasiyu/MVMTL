disaster at sea it takes better than two hours to find out if the faux legendary pianist 1900 will go down with the virginian when it is blown up at sea after being taken out of service . and it is two completely wasted hours . hard to say what is most annoying -- the omnipresent voiceover , the philosophical twaddle that rationalizes why he never leaves the ship , the philosophical twaddle when he almost leaves the ship , the bad acting , the farcical piano duel with jelly roll morton , the fleeting love story with a young passenger who looks like amelia earhart confused about why she 's on a ship instead of her plane . the movie is splendidly photographed -- give it that much . i watched it because of the director 's earlier cinema paradiso . he is a far better cinematic teller of memoirs than of fables .
