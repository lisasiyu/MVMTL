this goes waaaay too far - unrated version first of all - even though most of my friends hate them - i must admit that i do enjoy watching some good horror flicks . my dvd collection is also primarily concentrating on this genre . besides classics , such as `` psycho '' , `` the haunting ( original ) '' , `` rosemary 's baby '' , `` the exorcist '' , `` the omen ( original ) '' , `` the shining '' , `` the changeling '' , `` halloween '' , `` alien '' and `` the evil dead '' . i also enjoy more recent flicks , such as `` the 6th sense '' , `` the others '' , `` the ring ( us version ) '' , `` the grudge ( us version ) '' `` the descent '' , `` dawn of the dead ( remake ) '' and `` tcm 2003 remake '' . the problem with `` the beginning '' is , that a. the viewer knows that nobody will survive this massacre the second the movie starts . which leads to the fact that no hero can be found in this movie ! b . nobody gets to know why leatherface turned out this way . damn , they could 've atleast shown some flashbacks or a decent intro as e.g.in `` house of wax '' . c. there is waaaay too much unnecessary gore and therefore lack of true suspense . these facts , especially the last , make this movie a over the top gorefest in the same league as `` wolf creek '' , `` high tension '' , `` hostel '' and `` saw ( sequels ) '' . as one re-viewer stated . horror movies should entertain by giving the viewer bonechilling suspense and a few good scares . this movie sadly could n't succeed , due to unnecessary gore , splatter and blood . i do n't need that
