an example of what a live action anime could be like ... . if done horribly wrong . cyborg whether the creators realized it or not has a strong anime feel to it . sadly the movie is complete and total garbage . the story here is that jean claude van damm plays a warrior in the future who is out to get revenge on the leader of a gang in the anarchist future . there also happens to be a deadly disease plaguing mankind , and a cyborg knows the cure . that part of the story is irrelivant . for the most part it is van damm traveling across the us attempting to catch up to this madman and stop him . somewhere in the movie we get flashbacks of his past and at one point he gets the chance to bang his female companion . overall this movie is a waste and you can tell orion entertainment was milking van damm for all he was worth at this time . avoid
