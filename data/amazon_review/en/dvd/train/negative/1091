thirteen year old janey is a victim of sexual abuse this is a film that literally sees little wrong with child molesting . and no , i 'm not even slightly exaggerating . it is also bizarre that i am the sole reviewer to point this out . janey is only a 13 year old teenager . she is indeed rather mature for her age . nonetheless , janey is too young to legally allow a fully grown man to have sex with her . such an adult male ( or female ) is clearly breaking the law . janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined . the father is being played for a fool . this dysfunctional family seems doomed . janey 's younger brother needs her love and protection . is she capable of handling this responsibility ? will matters finally get out of control ? `` rain '' is morally bankrupt . the story line takes place in new zealand . perhaps the people associated with the american tv program `` to catch a predator '' and `` perverted justice '' should visit this country . david thomson flares into darknes
