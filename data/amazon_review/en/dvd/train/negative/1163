a fondly remembered movie from childhood , it does n't stand the test of time i loved this one as a kid but now it shows it 's age and it really gets the history wrong . part of the problem is that other than robert shaw 's part the rest of the movies follows far to many people into far to many subplots and gets lost . the locations used do n't show us the real winter conditions that were faced and even at the running time it has it moves far to slow and then just ends quickly . see battleground for a better take on this battle
