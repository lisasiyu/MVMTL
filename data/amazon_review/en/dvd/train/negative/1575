a poor excuse for a dvd do n't get me wrong . i love the story . i 've seen it in the cinema in the 80 's and i still love it . but the issue why i gave low ratings is because of the dvd . this is the first time i 've seen a dvd where the makers of it , puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie . talk about advertising ! second , on the cover , it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer . the only thing that i think , where the movie got it `` digital transfer '' is from a poor quality vhs tape to dvd . this is absurd ! even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording . i 've watch other sonny chiba 's movies from the 80 's in dvd format like ninja wars and gi samurai aka time slip and both quality is what a dvd should be . this one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man . the first 2 reviews , refers to other movies and not the one in question . to amazon , please remove this item from your listing .
