not what i was hoping for ... i had worn out my copy of the firm 's 5-day abs so i thought i would try something new . bad decision . there are way too many moves in a short period of time so you really do n't feel one exercise before you move on to the next . in addition , you really need to buy the `` firm sculpting stick '' to make many of the exercises work , which i found insulting and rather marketing-minded . i am sending this back
