mediocre dvd transfer ; average sci-fi movie for a 2-disc , director 's cut , my expectations were perhaps too high for this dvd . nevertheless , i was appalled at the poor quality of the transfer . the colors were dull throughout , and focus was frequently not at the beginning of scenes . for the movie itself , i do n't agree that it is holding up well over time . at 25 years old , the movie just has limited entertainment value for people who are n't waiting for their beloved canceled tv series to be on the big screen . there 's no question that ii and iv are the best of the series , but comparing it to other star trek original cast movies is n't putting the bar very high . my interest in watching this again was just having finished melville 's moby dick , the final scenes of which khan repeats liberally during the final space battle . that said , i think montalban was fantastic as the revenged-obsessed khan and very evocative of ahab . however , shatner 's pretentious kirk just becomes more grating as time goes on . the original cast schtick just does n't make for a compelling drama
