someone should have 'saved ' me from buying this ... bought this dvd for only 10 dollars at a not-so-local shopping centre , only because they did n't have this movie to rent at the video shop . after so much publicity , trailers , ads on busses , you 'd think this would be one of the funniest and coolest movies around . however . i nearly fell asleep in it . had to turn away more than a few times in boredom . and cliched to infinity , just watch the ending . pathetic and predictable . if you like predictable movies ? this dvd will be your new best friend . if not ? try something with a bit more imagination
