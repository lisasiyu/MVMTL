too much to cover in too short a time this dvd functions more or less as an advertisement for the other snl dvds that have been and continue to be marketed by nbc . the 25th anniversary special on this dvd lasts 2.5 hours , which sounds like a long time , but it 's not long enough to do justice to the talent that appeared on the shows over such a long period of time . as uneven as the show was from week to week and year to year , there was still a lot of great material -- far too much to cover in this format in any satisfying way . as a result , the clips that are shown are soundbites of soundbites -- often , just enough to cover a famous quote ( `` wild an crazy guys , '' etc . ) with a touch of lead-in . this may be enough to evoke a smile of nostalgia from someone who 's seen the skits , but that 's about it . when the skits were originally aired , they usually went on too long , but here the dvd 's producers err by going way too far in the opposite direction . i 'm not sure how you could do a worthwhile retrospective of 25 years worth of programming that would fit on one dvd , but if it ca n't be done ... maybe one should n't do it . the dvd comes with three `` extras '' : an interview of lorne michaels by tim russert , which is mildly interesting ; the `` day-after '' coverage of the 25th anniversary show by a heinous tv show i never heard of , `` access hollywood '' ; and promotional tv coverage by some other nbc news show , which featured clips that mostly overlapped with the special included on the dvd . again i ask : why put this material on a dvd ? the so-called extras bring nothing to an already lackluster party . all in all , disappointing . by the way , for those who care , the beastie boys do n't actually perform a number on the dvd . they play a couple of measures of one of their own songs before getting interrupted by elvis costello , and then they end up playing back-up for him
