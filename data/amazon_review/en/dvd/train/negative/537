is there anything more tiresome than social satire 30 years later ? some stories date really badly , and this film based on a major broadway hit of a few years before is one . all the social satire of looking back is predicated on a 1970s pov , and that view is in itself so skewed that practically none of it is either funny or relevant . decent enough work by alan alda and ellen burstyn , but the writing and directing cant be compensated for .
