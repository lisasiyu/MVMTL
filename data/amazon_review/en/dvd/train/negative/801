if you think you 've seen it before ... ... you have . this film has been compared to `` logan 's run '' , `` the matrix '' , and `` coma '' , to name a few , but it most strongly resembles 1979 b movie `` parts : the clonus horror '' , probably most widely screened by viewers of movie mock-a-thon `` mystery science theater 3000 '' . sitting through `` the island '' , i kept thinking to myself `` boy , this looks familiar . '' in fact , `` the island '' is almost a complete , play-by-play clone ( ba da ching ! ) of `` parts '' , right down to the outfits worn by the clones . there is currently a lawsuit against bay brought by the makers of `` parts '' , which should be an open-and-shut case . this film is set in a futuristic clone colonie , where the wealthy and influential pay top dollar to keep copies of themselves available for spare parts . the clones are kept docile and in the dark by the facility 's employees , not allowed to leave until they are selected to go to an almost mythical paradise ( the island ) . of course , the clones allegedly going to the island are actually being euthanized for their organs , their patrons having gotten sick . the movie focuses on a male clone who questions his environment and eventually brings down the enterprise . ewan mcgregor is satisfactory in this role , his acting reasonably good despite the bland dialouge . his female counterpart , scarlet johansen , is pure eye candy , a mediocre actress who happens to be a knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get the lead ( or even a major part ) in a college play ( the best performance is turned in by sean bean , the evil scientistï¿½ . ) there is plenty of action for the viewer to chew on , making for an entertaining enough popcorn movie , but it is not only nothing special , it is nothing original . maybe worth a rental , but not much more
