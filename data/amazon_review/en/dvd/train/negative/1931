poor at best i have this little ( very little ) section in my dvd bookcase that houses bad dvd buys . currently `` the yards '' and `` ghost world '' are the only two dvds that are housed on that shelf . i do n't know what to say , except the preview at best buy drove me to buy it on the spot and i was extremely disappointed that night when i watched it . slow story , not enough character development . all i can say is do n't let it be a dust collector in your dvd collection , like mine is
