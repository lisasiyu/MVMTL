pathetic stupefying and moronic is the most apt description of this waste of celluloid . though made during the cold war , its portrayal of russian people is unfairly mean-spirited and in a review i read elsewhere , it was described as xenophopic . i would go so far as to say it is propagandistic . its the kind of film which will appeal to today 's dumbed-down american who thinks he 's a little more special than everyone else in the world and that he has the right to blow up foreign villages and otherwise disregard laws and civil behavior . the idiotic characters justly deserved the punishment they received in this pathetic film
