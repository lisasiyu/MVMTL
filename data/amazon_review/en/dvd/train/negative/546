banality by any other name jeez , maybe i am getting old , but i really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest . a brilliant scientist . disfigured . angry . finds temporary techie fix for face . goes to get bad guys . fighting . more fighting . still more fighting . ex mate learns he 's alive . he leaves her anyway ( he 's too ugly ) . the end . more to come , if successful . not recommended
