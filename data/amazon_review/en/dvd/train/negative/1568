what a snooze fest . legally blonde 2 - red , white & blonde is a very disapponting sequel to the blockbuster hit 2001 , legally blonde . i love the original so much but the this one is slow , boring , has a stupid premise , and reese looks like she hated filming this movie . all the magic is gone , people still treat elle like she is an idiot . sally field 's character is heartless and cold as well , luke wilson makes a brief apparance as elle 's boyfriend and yes they do get married in the end . this sequel focuses on animal rights in washington d.c. elle worries about the safety of her dog , the adorable bruiser but i just could n't get in to the story or new characters . poor reese , she is a wonderful actress , but maybe she should have read the script again before she agreed to take this sequel head on . forget this film , buy the original instead .
