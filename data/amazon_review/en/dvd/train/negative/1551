interesting period piece , godawful dvd release although this dvd says it 's `` digitally remastered , '' that only means that it was transferred from film to the digital medium of dvd . the releasing company missed a golden opportunity to clean it up -- the film is grainy , flickering and shows signs of deterioration that could and should have been corrected before releasing the film on dvd . the soundtrack , as well , is perfectly awful , with shattered , screeching highs and inaudible lows . i have recordings made from wax cylinders recorded before 1910 that have been restored to sound much better than this 1934 release . it 's very discouraging that so little care and attention should have been paid to finally making this film available after so many years . anna may wong , and the people who buy this dvd , deserve better
