are you kidding ? people actually gave this movie 5 stars ! are they for real ? if you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you . it is fun to watch , but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking . it is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are . their are so many scar face ripoffs it 's offencive , and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said `` okay , we do n't have much film left , we got ta ' rap this up real quick . dmx , find religion ... and cut . '' rent the movie , try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying , ignore the horrible acting of naz , then return it . and when you review it please do n't give it five stars , those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop , not just some `` phat movie you and some down ass playas ' watched while moms was outta ' da ' house .
