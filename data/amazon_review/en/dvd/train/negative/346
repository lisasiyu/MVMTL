perfectly decent , perfectly inoffensive , and perfectly dull joel hershman 's `` greenfingers '' , starring the now-famous ( and utterly gorgeous ) clive owen and helen mirren , is a sweet , cutesy , and utterly empty british romantic comedy . in this forgettable , generic chick-flick , inmates at a british minimum-security prison take up gardening . initially , they are understandably reluctant to garden . but , get this , gardening ends up changing their lives ! and , after his parole , owen 's character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden ! and mirren 's character is so impressed with the innmates ' gardening that she even has them garden for her ! wow , where do people get this stuff ? of course , this being a `` romantic comedy '' and all , there is a romance between owen and mirren 's daughter that is so incredibly forced , awkward , and contrived that one can not help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other . in addition , peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed `` uplifting moments '' . and none of it works . for all its good intentions , `` greenfingers '' is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates ' rooms . it 's all perfectly decent , perfectly inoffensive , and perfectly dull
