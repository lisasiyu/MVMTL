and who could that be stalking us now ? along with the nanny , the stepdad , the cable guy , the 14-year-old girl with a crush ... we now have the photo processing clerk to fear ! yes , everyone is out to get us.. or at least that 's what hollywood would have us believe . i am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality . no wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion , mistrust , fear ( and the resulting isolation ) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us . yes , films like these have their place . however , i think hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality .
