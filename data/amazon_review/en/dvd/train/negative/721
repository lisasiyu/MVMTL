a huge disappointment like most people , i loved the original friday - a true classic . i had heard that this one was n't as good , so i rented a copy just to check it out for myself . this movie is straight-up garbage . mike epps ca n't carry chris tucker 's jock . what a waste of what could have been a very good movie series . stick with the original ; do n't waste your time or money on this one
