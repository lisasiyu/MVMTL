style way , way , way over substance i 'm a fan of the 1999 `` the mummy '' and was understandably looking forward to this sequel . in the summer of 2001 i went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and f/x . we just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium . it 's a curious thing that too much action ( and f/x ) in a film can be boring . it may not seem logical but it 's true , and `` the mummy returns '' is exibit a. i recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so i decided to re-watch it after over five years . yet , after a mere 10-15 minutes i was again completely detached from the picture , even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on , or , at least , things that should have been exciting . `` the mummy returns '' has a lot going for it : a great cast , locations , costumes , cinematography , f/x , etc . in addition it has a great indiana jones appeal . unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement . what went wrong ? simply put , no substance . `` the mummy returns '' abandons the characters , and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and f/x sequences . final analysis : `` the mummy returns '' has so many ingredients right , but it somehow utterly fails . it 's unadulterated cinematic junk . it should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements , including budget , and stupefyingly fumbling the ball . needless to say this could have been a great film franchise , but it was not to be . `` returns '' put an end to that .
