disappointed i have been buying workout video's/dvd 's with denise austin for years and have been very happy with them . however since denise is no longer with artisan ( she is now with lions gate ) the quality has changed . the camera man ca n't seem to sit still . when i buy a workout dvd , it 's not because i want to look at a pertty face . far to often the camera man is giving an up close of a face when he should be showing the whole body so we can see what we , or as in this case our child/ren , need to do . by the second workout , the camera man slowed it down making it much easier to follow . still , it is not the quality i am used to from denise . it could have been a great workout but instead it was a big disappointment
