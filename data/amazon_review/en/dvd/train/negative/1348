flyboys=pearl harbour ... no redeeming value except as a clear illustration of how not to make a combat flying film this stinker comes close to equalling that gigantic bomb from 2001 `` pearl harbour '' starring ben affleck . the acting is wooden and forgettable , the action sequences are humorous at best , and the direction is ... well , let 's just say , director tony bill has apparently picked up his directing chops while starring in `` barb wire '' . the directing style seems to be ... throw in as much loud music as possible , add a heaping helping of a lame love story , toss on some of the worst , most embarrassing lines imaginable , and let 's not forget those all important cgi effects and what you end up with is the worst/funniest depiction of ww1 flying action since the three stooges . if you want to watch real ww1 flying action with real ww1 biplanes , check out `` the blue max '' . that movie used real ww1 vintage aircraft , that actually have weight to them and do not perform impossible flying stunts that the blue angels do not even attempt using fa-18 jets . pacing is terribly frantic , music is insufferable , character development and construction of any dramatic impact is non-existent . pass this one by , unless you 're willing to spend 2 hours viewing an all too typical expensive , wasteful , useless , hollywood blockbuster bomb
