`` r '' -rated movie , not pg-13 ! ! ! buyer beware ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i 've read the other reviews and i do n't know what version they got but the dvd i received has more than a brief scene of david with his wife ( breasts clearly exposed ) in bed . that scene alone would not be allowed in a pg-13 movie . there is another scene where david is viewing bathsheba bathing . she is standing , completely nude and you can see everything . then the camera pans in close for a `` waist up '' scene and bathsheba and her female helper are washing her breasts and body . this is diffinetly an r-rated scene . this movie is not biblically accurate as others have claimed . people need to read their bibles before making such a claim . there are many scenes that are accurate , but there are many that are not . one example is that in the movie bathsheba would n't sleep with david while her husband was alive . not true in scipture . in the bible , david saw her , had her called to the palace and slept with her . then david sent a letter to have uriah killed . would of been a decent movie without the smut
