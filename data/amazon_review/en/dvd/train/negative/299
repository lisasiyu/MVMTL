i knew there had to be something wrong with this dvd ! i received this dvd from my brother who is possibly a bigger kevin smith fan than i am . i thought the fact that he was giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until i watched the dvd myself . the degrassi episodes are amazingly boring and jay and silent bob 's toned-down appearances do n't help much . i really liked the original degrassi series so i was disappointed by this dvd . there are some funny moments in the `` extras '' section of the dvd but i would still only recommend this as a `` rent '' or something to buy used if you are a diehard fan .
