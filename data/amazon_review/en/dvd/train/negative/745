not worth buying being a huge fan of sandra bullock , i bought this movie thinking it would be fun and cute like her other work . nope , this movie is garbage . first thing i noticed was that the sound quality is extremely poor which goes along hand in hand with the poor camera angles and shoots . the acting is very bad and the story line is simply ridiculous . over all , it 's not a movie worth buying .
