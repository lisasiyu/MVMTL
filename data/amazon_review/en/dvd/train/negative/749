the film deserves no credit . disney thinks that people are too stupid to read the great stories that they changed . i am so mad at disney and their movie `` hercules '' because they changed the film just because they think they will get away with changing stories . i like greek mythology , but the movies have not been good at all . and this weak effort is not going to do anything about it . the plot has been changed completly , pegasus is never mentioned in the real version , he is not trying to impress people , he had no trainer , the lion and the lion skin is not mentioned , the hydra fight is because of a different reason , ugly characters , hercules was never in love with a chick , hades is not a bad guy but he is not good either , and all kinds of things that i wo n't mention . do n't buy this movie because it is completly different , why do n't you read greek mythology instead of watching this
