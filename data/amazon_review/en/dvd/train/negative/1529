thomas hardy ? not even oliver hardy ! after two hours of watching it , i still do n't know what it was about . yes , the scenery is fantastic , but a national geographic film would have done more . i applaud the acting of milla jovovich , and nastassja kinski . but , the kudos reviewers have given to peter mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie . i hardly heard anything he said and there are no english subtitles offered on the dvd . as for wes bentley , that 's acting ? he kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him , or a co-worker being blown to `` kingdom come '' ( that 's a pun based on the movie ) . he makes clint eastwood look like laurence olivier . the film is supposedly based on a thomas hardy book , but very loosely based , and the scriptwriters should have at least used cliff notes to have learned more about the story and the character development . they obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest .
