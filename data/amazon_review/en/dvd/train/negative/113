just say no this movie is no `` heathers . '' it 's not even `` mean girls . '' as hard as it tried to be witty , shocking , dark , and satirical , it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop . maybe i 'm just too old for this drivel -- although i could watch `` clueless '' and `` the craft '' until my dvd player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push , i just did n't get it . the movie was n't funny ( which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses , carol kane , could n't even elicit a smile out of me ) , the plot was full of holes , and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived . i was n't expecting greatness when i watched jawbreakers , but i was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment . unfortunately , the `` entertainment '' piece was dropped and i was just left with `` mindless .
