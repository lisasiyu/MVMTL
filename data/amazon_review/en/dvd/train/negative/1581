borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-ing ! when i saw that m. night shyamalan was directing this film my interest was peaked , despite the silly premise about an apartment superintendant rescuing some otherworldly nymph from the complex 's pool and trying to return her e.t . - reminiscent character home . i enjoyed shyamalan 's `` the sixth sense '' and `` the village '' ( despite both films ' easily predictable endings ) but was very disappointed with this downright soggy outing ( sorry , have to throw some water puns in here ) . i laughed outright during the first 15 minutes , promptly dubbed it `` the watery tart '' [ /monty python ] ; then fell asleep out of sheer boredom soon after , thereby missing the bulk of the film . i 'd highly recommend it to anyone having trouble sleeping .
