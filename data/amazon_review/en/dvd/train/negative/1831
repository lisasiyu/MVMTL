negative ... negative ... the 1st season of the batman was ok , but the second season ruled ... third season is mediocre so far . i want the second season . the only worthwhile episode on this disc is `` the big chill '' . the other 2 are lack luster . the big chill had a lot of stale `` freeze '' jokes , but was well presented . a 2 out of 5 stars
