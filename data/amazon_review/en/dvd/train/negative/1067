it 's a perfect example of today 's horror movies which is n't a good thing . if you 've seen any recent horror flicks within the past 10 years ( taking lives , wrong turn , i still know what you did last summer , scream ) , then you know it 's filled with the dummest imaginable good guys , cheesy plot and almost un-killable bad guys . and scenes that are supposed to thrill you and you just wonder when this is going to end . i almost fell asleep in a few of those movies , that 's how lame , tiring and boring they are . fortunately , for this film , it has jessica alba and seth green , who are two fantastic actors/actresses and are always delightful to see . seth green is hilarious as the main characters buddy , and jessica alba is more then sexy . however , the movie is beyond cheesy ( like a hand jumping out a microwave through the window , smashing the glass in the mean time and landing in the bush , but it ca n't escape the microwave . or , when the lady ( played by vivica a . fox ( kill bill ) ) is hit by a car , which is backing up , and then is sent 50 feet . uh huh , that 's realistic . ends sarcasm . ) then there is tones of un-necessary gore and silly scenes like the guy losing his head . and how exactly did his buddies get back ? they do n't explain anything and assume everything is magical . it delivers the comedy pretty well , thanks to seth green for that , but is just too silly , far too cheesy and extremely lame ( a hand that is possessed ? please , give me a break .
