not worth it boring ! all this time is spent during the dvd talking about the john fisher technique , but not really showing you anything specific . lots of great video shots of dogs romping about with their owners and shots of classes being conducted , all being voiced over about the 'great john fisher technique ' . who cares ! i did n't order the video so that i could go look for a trainer who trains with this technique , i ordered it so that i could train my own dog . so little instructional information was given and the video was so boring , me and my dogs fell asleep watching it . what a waste
