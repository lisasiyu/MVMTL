broken . the breakdance trio are back . this time around they 're trying to stop the demolition of a community center . and at the same time solve some personal issues , like kelly 's - lucinda dickey - theater dancing career , ozone 's - adolfo quinines - feelings towards kelly and turbo 's - michael chambers - love interest . if the first movie was great and full of amazing breakdancing , cool music and acceptable story , then this sequel is the complete opposite . you get bad acting , bad choreography , bad music and bad costume design . even ice t sucked in this film . what a waste of good dancing talents . but , if you liked the first movie , like me , then you ca n't resist buying this sequel . at least you 'll see turbo 's ceiling dance . the best thing in the film .ozone cheesy roof dancing and kelly 's not that bad acting . otherwise avoid .
