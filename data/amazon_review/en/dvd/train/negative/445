do n't believe the hype i 've only watched the first six episodes so far , waiting for some in depth story to unfold with diverse characters ... blah blah blah . nothing but a simple story line with everything spelled out . there 's no complexity to it , no unfolding of the characters , no mystery of peeling through the layers of their lives . all the episodes seem so long and dragged out but nothing different ever really happens . boy tries to save girl , boy gets beat up , boy does what he feels is right without thinking it through , no strategy , no thought to his actions . it almost seems like a saturday morning cartoon with violence and unnecessary rape suggested scenes . another thing that really bugs me is the fact that the evil king hamdo is such a whiny coward , but yet somehow manages to recieve complete obedience from all his subjects . somebody would have dethroned him by now , in fact there was an assassination attempt where the two assassins were skilled enough to sneak all the way into his chambers with out being noticed , kill his guards , have him in there sights , and not only miss him , but stand out in the open only to be shot by his scared shaky hand from under his desk . the actions and reactions of this world are just to unrealistic . i want my wasted hours back . good thing this only cost me twenty dollars
