fine film ruined by voice-overs on this dvd . a solid documentary with interesting new footage and invaluable testimony from participants in the battle and related events is ruined by loud voice-overs by poor actors . both the narration and the voice-overs of interviewees are mediocre at best . if you are averse to dubbing of fictional films , you will understand that overdubbing of non-fictional work is particularly onerous . clearly a decision was made to create a version that would be accessible to those averse to reading subtitles . but in the age of dvd it is fairly absurd not to include the original version of the film .
