great movie..hddvd worthless goodfellas is a classic `` cult `` movie and there is no doubt about it.but sorry when it comes to talk about high definition the rating goes to 2 stars maximum . there is nothing to be amazed in the hd transfer of this movie because purely and simply there is no hd such a 3d lookalike pictures , deep contrast etc ... it seems hd need today 's technology to render effects . in comparaison `` ray `` is rendering all the amazing good things of hd in pictures and sound
