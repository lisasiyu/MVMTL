please tell your children the history is different . i realize historical accuracy was not the intent of the filmmakers here , but as a history teacher , i feel the need to beg you to tell your children that this is not the way jamestown really went down . an unreal number of students enter high school believing that this film is a historical documentary , and the first step to teaching jamestown is to convince the students otherwise . perhaps good can come from this film , in that it can teach young people to be critical of secondary sources
