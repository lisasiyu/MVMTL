just about what i expected , only more boring ... i 'm sorry , i love gina gershon and i was looking forward to watching this movie since i do like action films . but this is such a run of the mill martial arts flick . i was n't even intrigued to watch the whole thing without hitting the fast forward button through most of the show . the basis of this movie - the main character is an expert martial artist who comes to town just as a rising of an aryan militia becomes prominent nearby . it starts with them killing the black preacher everyone loves who promotes people to stop hate , and the white boys in the militia do n't like that . *gasp , i never would have guessed* main character kicks everyone 's behind , gets the girl , acting is horrible and the plot could be pasted to any b flick action film . your time could be better spent watching paint dry . or if you 're desperate for something like this then watch universal soldier , at least it was funny
