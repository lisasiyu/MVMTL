very disappointed my 9-year-old daughter absolutely loved the book . i thought i would get the movie for her so that she can get a visual sense of what rural life is like in america . specifically , i wanted her to see how marty 's family is rural and poor yet proud and dignified . unfortunately , none of that came through very well in the movie . in fact , the `` ruralness '' and poverty aspects did not come through at all ! also , what 's the deal with this absolutely unnecessary character named sam ? ? finally , this movie also failed to present the various ethical dilemmas that marty had to face in his attempt to rescue shiloh
