awful if you want to find out about evel knievel avoid this garbage . i do n't own it but i saw most of it on tv and was appalled . george eads was not too bad a choice but they could have found someone better . and what 's with the peeing scenes ? what kind of a statement were they trying to make ? ? ? ? i never did see the ending of it ... it was that lousy . it 's a complete disaster . someone needs to do a big motion picture about evel knievel like they did about muhammed ali . the best actor i can think of is matthew mcconaughey as evel .
