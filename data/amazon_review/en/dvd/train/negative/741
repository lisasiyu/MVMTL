pathetic gangster style movie i 've read a lot of reviews for this movie stating that it is an excellent film and some even call it one of the best movies of all time . i could n't disagree more . i found this film to be a disappointment . tom hanks & period-gangster style films just do n't go together . when i see tom hanks , i see him in big.. not as a serious actor . in `` road to perdition '' hanks plays michael sullivan , a born and bred gangster in the 1930 's , who is forced to abandon his lifestyle when his wife and one of his sons are killed and he is forced to protect the elder son , a witness of a killing . the story does leave something to be desired . predictable and hackneyed plot , with pretty weak story development . i 'm a big fan of movies like the godfather & goodfellas but this one just plain stinks
