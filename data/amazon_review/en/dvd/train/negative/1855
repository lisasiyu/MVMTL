kinda dull these old movies are best kept in your memory . when you rewatch them , it becomes so clear that they 're like ancient history . weirdly , 1960 's movies are more dated than those of the 1920 's . what was going on in that decade that caused people to make heroes of anti-heroes that are litttle more than dirty criminals ? the only redeeming part of the film is the setting in the cajon pass before the rampage of urbanization that is quickly destroying it
