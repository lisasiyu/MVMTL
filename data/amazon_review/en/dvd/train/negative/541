predictable and uneven i 'm not going to write too much . if you need to hear more just check other reviews down here . from all the 3 episodes only the first one , by kar-wai , is worth your time . `` the hand '' is well done and typical kar-wai . beautifully shot by his usual contributor christopher doyle , it 's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch . gong li , always very elegant , give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story . well crafted but very predictable . the director lately seems to be referencing himself , which is halfway form self parody . `` equilibrium '' is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy . other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots , is a simple and boring exchange between downey jr. playing an adman and his analyst played by arkin . but the worst by far is the antonioni 's episode . is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment . the , once , great director should have just retired by now ( he was 91 in 2004 ) and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces
