disappointing i have to say that i was disappointed with this dvd . the variety of dance styles it shows is nice , but the bellydance and bollywood sections were awful . i 'm only giving it 2 stars because it is the only dvd i 've found so far that even touches on the flamenco style , which i 've become interested in lately
