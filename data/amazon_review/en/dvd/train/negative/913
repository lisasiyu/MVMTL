read the book instead just a note to those who were uncomfortable watching this film with their children ; movies have ratings for a reason . this movie is rated pg-13 , which tells you up front that it has content that is considered inappropriate for children . in this case , it is crude humor . what i do n't understand is why they made a movie with a story line aimed at a young audience , and then inclduded content that earned it a rating that recommends that a young audience should n't see it
