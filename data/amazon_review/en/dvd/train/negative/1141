historical value , but poor image quality it 's very nice to go back to those exciting years with this dvd , but they could have done a better job with the image digitalization . there is much better image quality bootleg dvd 's out there with virtually the same content . i think fans deserve the best for the money they spend and unfortunately , this is not the case .
