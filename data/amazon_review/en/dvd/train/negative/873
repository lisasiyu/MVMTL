decent `` b level '' science fiction entertaining but not in the same league as star trek , the new battlestar galactica , buffy , or roswell . never explained why every alien they meet speaks english , especially as language barriers were important in the original movie . some of the acting is wooden , especially teal'c and carter . however , jackson , o'neil and hammond are well-acted characters . the plot lines do not bear a lot of scrutiny
