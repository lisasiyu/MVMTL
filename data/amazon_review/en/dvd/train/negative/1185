not recommended my husband and i were very disappointed with this dvd set . one dvd contains an `` action documentary '' with music - we did not like that dvd . we thought the second instructional dvd is mediocre and might be helpful if you are a complete novice . the treatment of subjects is in our opinion pretty superficial overall . there is little breakdown of technique . there is minimal race footage , which is helpful to watch to learn by watching experts . parts of the footage seemed recycled - we heard very similar discussions about ski wax in the separate `` tuning '' and `` equipment primer '' sections . you can not watch the dvds straight through as they dump you back into a main menu after you complete a scene . so you must frequently fiddle with the controls to select scenes to watch . that feature is helpful if you want to access scenes easily perhaps but we did not like it . i am not usually a complainer but we were so disappointed with this set that i wanted to put up a review .
