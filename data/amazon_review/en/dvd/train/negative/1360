obviously there is an audience for this product ... . george a. romero enters with yet another installment in his banal and grossly visual zombie flicks and hopefully this will be the last of them . obviously there is an appreciative audience who enjoys watching partially decomposed bodies stomp around and grunt and eat body parts of the living because a lot of people write positively about this film . for this viewer the 'parody ' eludes . land of the dead is simply a dark , grotesque , poorly written , hastily thrown together bit of treacle to make money off the folks who like this genre . but how fine actors like simon baker , john leguizamo , dennis hopper , asia argento , and robert joy agree to the casting agent 's invitation to star in this film is a conundrum . grady harp , december 0
