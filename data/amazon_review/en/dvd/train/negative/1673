add to cart ... . no ! this movie made me want to scrape turd-shaped photons off of the back of my retinas . anyone who praised this dogpile is either struck by the popularity of the title or saw it when they were 5 years old and are still trying to hold onto a simpler time in their life . the plot was paper-thin and the acting made me want to wear one of those silver shamrock masks in the hope my life would end at any second while watching this shameful reminder that anyone can make a movie . i love the halloween series ( most of it , anyway ) but this is crap . pass on this one , kids
