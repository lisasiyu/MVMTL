lets see ... ... nope ! ( 2 & 1/2 to be exact ) i have no ideal , why i 've choosen to write a review on this particular movie . i 'm not really a fan of comedies & after watching this i can see why . however , all in all , the film has been well made , and luckily does n't divulge into valugarity & offensiveness like a lot of recent comedies of this sort have -well maybe a little but not a lot . the actors are all likeable - unfortuntely i ca n't say that with some of the characters they portray . catherine keener is one of my favorite actresses but she does n't use her trademark sardonic wit and sarcastic humor like in a lot of her other movies ( i.e . being john malkovich , your friends and neighbors ) but she still manages to come away from this subversive comedy with a well likable character . ok , not to spend to much talking about this film : with all there is likable about this movie , for some reason , it just did n't gel with me . oh and by the way : i too know a few people like the character steve carell portrays in this film and you know what : they 're all highly intelligent individuals . sure they lack social skills and the right relationship , but why - in this country especially - is that so f & cking frown upon . if i had the choice of being a sexaholic hearthrob & a vastly intelligent person , i would choose the latter . seeya
