where is the button for -0- stars ? ! thinly veiled attempt to push politically correctness down the throats of our children , sacrificing the faith and beliefs of their elders in the attempt . are n't we so fortunate to have filmmakers to teach our children for us what their priorities and beliefs should be ? oh pleeeeze ! i 'm so glad i could watch this one with my daughter so i could point out the obvious attempts at manipulation . we discussed the issues , and thought for ourselves .
