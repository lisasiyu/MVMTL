weak this movie was a weak effort by capra , who directed it , and the star , gary cooper . it 's a good story , just poorly directed ( capra ca n't hit a home run every time ) . i found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on . and no extra features on the dvd , at least none to speak of
