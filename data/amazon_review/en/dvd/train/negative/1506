for lee/dracula completists only jess franco has to be one of the worst directors out there . he 's managed to take a great story , hire a terrific cast , set them in interesting locations and still make a mess of the film . he uses a zoom lense at every opportunity , his day for night photography is a joke and the whole thing moves at a snail like pace.the only reason to have this movie is if you are a christopher lee or bram stoker fan and even then only as an interesting curiosity.the one thing it has going for it is the fact that there are more of stokers actual dialogue spoken in this than any other dracula film
