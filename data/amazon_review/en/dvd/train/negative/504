not even worth finishing saw the previews of the first movie , but i was n't expecting too much from that . i tried to finish both the first and the second , but that did n't work out too well ... i felt these films did n't deserved to be watched all the way to the end . i do n't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie , and that includes the first . all i really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it ... y'all should really consider watching cops and those insane police chases shown on tv . after all this is just another episode of cops with guest actors in it
