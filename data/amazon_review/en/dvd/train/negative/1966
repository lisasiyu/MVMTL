terrible i thought it was boring.i didnt like the concept of it was too jewish . i didnt like they made jews too strict . i didnt like the way they made the customs . i didnt like renee zellweger got asked too many personal questions . for example they questioned her about the jewish ritual bath . i could understand it because i am an orthdox jew . because i have gone to yeshiva . most non jewish pepole cant understand the movie . as well as non orthdox jews.boaz yakin had no right makin the movie like this . he should make a sequel to learn from his mistakes to make it a public movie . i wish i were in show business to make the movie more normal
