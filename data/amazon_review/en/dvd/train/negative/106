bette and woody ? bette midler and woody allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing . instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as bette and woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school . they also discover that they have been cheating on one another . the movie gets boring rather fast as bette and woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters . i would have expected better from these two
