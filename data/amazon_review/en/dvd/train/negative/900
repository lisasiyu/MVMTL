wellman adaptation lacks suspense ... after watching the fabulous bonus features on this dvd ( a biography of william 'wild bill ' wellman with observations by robert mitchum and tab hunter , another bio of `` track '' author walter van tilburg clark , a look at actual mountain lions and their habitat , and more ) , i realized i held a 'minority opinion ' of the film , itself , compared to many of the reviewers you 'll read , here ; i think it is stagy , lacks the sense of dread and palpable suspense of the novel , and does n't 'hold up ' as well as most of the director 's work . a tale of a dysfunctional family at it 's boiling point , and the impact a nearly primordial panther has , in changing their lives , the characters , with the exception of always watchable robert mitchum , as the domineering middle son , are all either boring , frustratingly indecisive , or downright unlikable . oldest son william hopper , best-known as 'paul drake ' in television 's `` perry mason '' , is the dreamer , who 'bonds ' with the environment , but lacks the instinctive power to defeat the cat , and never comes across as more than wishy-washy ; bitter spinster sister teresa wright offers a one-note portrayal that soon becomes grating ; youngest son tab hunter is so wimpy that you quickly lose interest in him ; philip tonge , the loquacious alcoholic father , whose drinking problem , in the novel , is tragic , here becomes a stereotyped comic drunk , with hidden bottles of liquor providing 'comic relief ' ; diana lynn , as hunter 's girl , tries hard , but never seems more than a minor character in the proceedings ; even legendary beulah bondi , as the greedy , bible-spouting , mean-spirited mother , seems to simply channel her 'bad mom ' portrayal from the `` what if ? '' sequence of `` it 's a wonderful life '' . worst of all , ex-little rascal carl 'alfalfa ' switzer , encased in phony-looking 'old age ' make-up to 'pass ' as a 100-year-old ranch hand/medicine man , looks neither believable , or comfortable in the role . with a farm set that looks patently artificial ( and obviously on a sound stage ) , the outdoor scenes , shot at mount rainier , must take up the slack ; sadly , despite the creativity in using high contrasts to make the colors achieve a 'black and white ' look , the book 's greatest asset , the constant , frightening 'unseen ' presence of the malevolent cat was , to me , never achieved , despite a mitchum monologue as he gradually succumbs to helpless fear ; in fact , hunter 's final confrontation with the cat is handled so 'routinely ' that you ca n't understand what all the fuss was about ! the film was a big letdown !
