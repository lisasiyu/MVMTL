a hitchcock film in name only that goes on for ever i have nothing against silent films . in fact clara bow 's 'it ' , lon chaney 's 'the phantom of the opera ' and louise brooks 's 'pandora 's box ' are amongst my all-time favourites . but with the exception of 'the lodger ' , hitchcock never really got going in silent films . 'the farmer 's wife ' certainly had the potential for an easy going , enjoyable comedy , but not when it lasts over 2 hours . i challenge anyone to watch this film in one sitting without their eyelids feeling increasingly heavy . on the plus points , laserlight has dispensed with one of those embarrassing tony curtis introductions , and has provided us with a newly recorded ( and very good ) score . the picture quality is also very good . if you 're tempted to buy this dvd because it 's a hitchcock film , i 'd say do n't . it is only worth a look to anyone with an interest in silent films or a genuine hitchcock enthusiast
