what a movie one of the most powerful and disturbing movies i have ever seen . thank god for the canadians . i doubt this could have been made in america . but it was disturbing . i grew to literally hate some of the people in thia movie and had to shake off what i felt when they found it was time to pay the piper . this should be required watching for all straight people . maybe then they would figure out that pediphiles are not gay . there is a vast difference between gay males and pedophiles . anyway , i can not recommend this movie strongly enough . the acting and the group of people who directed and produced this movie were very brave in doing so . this is a taboo subject in the u.s. once again , thanks to the canadians and the european 's who do make this type of movie . gary in az
