not as good , but still watchable ... this second sequel to `` darkman '' maintains the visual style of the first two , has great music , a few good action moments , and a very good performance from arnold vosloo as the hero . these are the four things i liked most about `` darkman 3 : die darkman die , '' which is n't a bad movie , but it 's not very good either . i 'm not only a fan of darkman , i 'm also a fan of sam raimi , liam neeson , and arnold vosloo . given this , i was sad to see raimi and neeson leave the franchise , but am thankful for vosloo 's performance . he does a great darkman/westlake and the sequels , especially this movie , have him to thank . while the second was a great follow-up , this film is a little on the stupid side . jeff fahey , overacting in every scene , plays bad guy peter rooker , who is a drug dealer who is after darkman when a large sum of money is stolen from him . the plot digs deeper into rooker 's life and soon darkman is disguising himself as rooker and befriends his wife and daughter . darkman soon makes a vow that he will not get involved with the family , that he is only after peter . but soon darkman 's light side gets the better of him . the movie is bleeding with predictable moments and painfully awful one-liners . thankfully , director bradford may keeps a dark , violent tone to the movie and mostly keeps the movie serious about itself . there are a few unintentionally funny moments , more so than in the second , and this hurts the movie a little . i suppose the reason to see this film is if you liked the first two . i did , and gladly added this one to my collection . i have no regrets about it , but take fair warning : only fans will enjoy this one . everyone else will be in the dark
