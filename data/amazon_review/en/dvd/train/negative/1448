also a mingus fan and fellow bassist high points and low points often in the same song . overall a pretty forgetable performance . i found jack walrath 's ( trumpet ) performance pretty inspiring , but george adams ( sax ) came off as a way over the top and annoying . i think i 'll go listen to mingus ah um right now to wash the taste out of my mouth
