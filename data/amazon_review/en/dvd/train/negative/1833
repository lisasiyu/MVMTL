the nadir of corman 's shining collection peter lorre 's , '' the black cat '' , is charmingly done.yet , the other two are stinkers.i 'm a corman fan , but this was boring and silly to watch.i think they had a good idea , bringing the trilogy it to the big screen.but , this version and interpretation of poe 's masterpieces did n't translate well at all.so , beware of the dog
