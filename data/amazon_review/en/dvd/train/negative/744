what the hell were they thinking ? well what can i say about this movie ? well one thing is : it was n't what i 'd expected . those who 'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but i still wanted to see it . i was wrong and they were right . the movie is about a zebra named marty who wants to go to `the wild ' , bring in a lion called alex who is self obsessed , a hippo named gloria who is overprotective and a giraffe named melman who need psychiatric care . marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to `help ' him , but four get pinned in manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to africa . along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins ( who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps ) and get stranded in madagascar , meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs . that 's basically the whole movie in a nutshell . the group fight , alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat . end of story . the entire look of the 3d animation was terrible as well . they should have continued with shrek 3 instead of making this movie . it 's pointless to watch . the most interesting thing in the entire dvd was the `penguins christmas caper ' , which was n't the short movie itself , but the man who played patrick from spongebob squarepants is the polar bear . for those of you planning to buy this dvd , stay away . it 's a huge rip off . it 's just something to keep you waiting for shrek 3
