0 stars : these movies are worse than the original . these movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies . from a horror movie fan 's perspective , i remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original , `` it 's alive '' . the only thing about babies ( mutated or not ) that scares me is having to change their diapers ... it stinks and this entire trilogy stinks too ! what a worthless ... waste
