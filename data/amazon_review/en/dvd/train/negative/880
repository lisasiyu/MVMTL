1 star if you own the extended version , 5 stars if you just want the movies i , like a lot of others was kind of annoyed when i saw another issue out . i own the extended and theatrical releases already . but , i had to buy them to see the `` never before behind the scenes documentary '' . to be honest , i was n't impressed . a few funny things , but all in all ... i could have lived without it . it 's just a bunch of stuff slapped together with no rhyme or reason . the extended version extra material is so far superior . that 's my opinion . but like me , you may just have to have it ! shame on the greedy movie companies for doing this to us ! if you do n't own the movies and are generally not into the extras , this is definitely a good way to go , you get both versions and in a very smart package
