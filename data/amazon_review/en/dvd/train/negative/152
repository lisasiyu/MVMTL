waste of time ... as much as i like morgan freeman and ashley judd , i really wanted to like this film . i enjoyed them in kiss the girls , and i expected another interesting film . their performances were the only bright spot , but they could n't rescue this movie . this film was so unbelievable and disjointed it made me want to scream . there was absolutely nothing in this film that was plausible . as many other reviewers noted ( i only wish i had read the reviews before i wasted 2 hours with this celluloid pile of feces ) , it was so very predictable . i rented 2 films yesterday , and i had trouble watching both of them , for very different reasons . the other film was `` monster '' , starring charlize theron and christina ricci . i almost could n't watch that film because it was so realistic and it just sucked me into the story and i forgot that it was a movie . it absolutely is a gripping story , and ms. theron richly deserved the best actress oscar that she received for it . conversely , i almost could n't watch high crimes because it was so ridiculous . do yourself a favor and skip this one .
