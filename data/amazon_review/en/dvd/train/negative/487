sleeping pill ! not a workout ! this is the most boring , unmotivating , uninteresting workout i have ever owned , yoga or other . i am exceptionally disappointed , as it was voted best workout dvd of 2005 by self magazine . i have only been practicing for a few weeks , having fallen in love with fit tv 's namaste workouts , i expected the same great music , flowing rhythm , and steady pace . instead , this is an incredibly slow-moving , dull workout that does n't even challenge me , a true beginner . i adore yoga , and wanted a longer , challenging workout -- this is not it . i 'm back to my free fittv namaste workouts , until i can find somethng better
