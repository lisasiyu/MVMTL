great if you dig hallmark cards i loved `` my so-called life '' and was expecting something good here , based on all these reviews . but the soap opera advertisements they stuck on the beginning of these dvds were a bad omen . still , i hung in and hoped for the best . i was sitting there watching and really wondering `` do people really relate to this stuff ? '' the characters on this show look like they 're from jc penney catalogs , or ivory soap commercials . white bread , sanitary , vapid ... thankfully all the people i know in real life are a million times more interesting than these fake people . this show makes me hope that i never have the bad fortune to make eyes with some guy in a parking lot and start dating him . the kids on this show are cute , but all kids are cute . nothing can save them or the adult characters or anyone from the extremely boring writing . i am sooooo glad that the world is nothing like how it 's portrayed on this show . never again ! !
