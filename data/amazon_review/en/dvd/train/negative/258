boring fluff i recently gave this movie another shot , at the request of a friend . i was impressed , this time , with the beauty and consistency of the cinematography . it 's as if every scene could be a postcard , and the use of color and characters and costumes makes for decent viewing . and the songs are great , if a little `` forced '' into the movie . unfortunately , that 's all there is , except beautiful brad rowe , totally wasted here in this nothing piece about self-indulgence and galling disregard for everyone that loves you ( while pining away for what you obviously ca n't have . ) add to that a generous splash of feigned concern for others ( sean p. hayes ' character ) while simply pursuing your own desires . ( `` i want to be there for him . '' ) right . it 's so artificial , it 's about as convincing as plastic palm trees . there are a few funny lines and nice dance numbers , but not enough to cover up the gaping holes and long , heart-felt pauses of nothing . someone made this picture to fulfill their dream , and did a fine job of casting and cinematography . there is little else to see here . even as a fluff piece , it 's barely worth your time
