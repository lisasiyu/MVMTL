the emperor 's new clothes despite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality , this film is a complete put-on . the long `` set-piece '' scenes ( wedding , russian roulette , etc . ) are much discussed , usually either in the context of being `` essential for character development '' or `` boring '' . in fact they 're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills . once he does try to move things along , awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set-piece to another , you can see the reason for his procrastination - despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth , he really has nothing to say . the actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film 's awkward vacuousness , by giving false and short-lived impressions of character and narrative , but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything `` happen '' narrative-wise . 2 stars is rather generous , but de niro , walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting , albeit for such a misguided cause . ultimately , despite some controversy , many of the film 's questionable portrayals of vietnam , vietnamese , america , americans and war are to be condemned more for their cinematic silliness than for their historical inaccuracy
