better than staring at a wall ... one mindblowing , boring saturday night i decided to watch i know what you did last summer . oh what a choice . so i sat there and watched and watched . the first maybe 25 minutes seemed quite entertaining . but as the plot began to unravel , it seemed more clear to me that it was just like any other scary teen movie . yes , some parts of it were suspensful . but the movie was very pointless . some guy chasing after some rich ass teens after they killed a guy that was n't even related to him ? and what was up with the whole costume ? it was very stupid and predictable . bassicaly this movie is good if you have nothing else to do , than waste one hour and a half of your life .
