do n't waste your time ! i ordered this dvd on the premise of viewing a great , seriously done , artistic , erotic film based on the reviews it had already . what i watched had to be the stupidest movie i have ever seen ! not only was the story line not complete ( you basically have to assume a lot because it does n't talk about the origin of the beast at all [ what the hell was that , a werewolf ? ] , but it also delves into comedy sometimes , unintentionally [ like the idiotic screeming and running around of the girl near the end ] ) . and the guy dressed in the beast costume , well , i guess they were n't that into special effects back then except for the `` gallons '' of ejaculate they used in the rape scene . totally stupid ! if this was great euro-sex of the 70 's , i 'll stay away from anything else produced by this guy . the best sex in here was at the beginning with the horses and then the servant getting it from the daughter ( who they should have used in more of the scenes ) , but then it 's all down hill from there . thank god i only spent $ 9.99 on this crap ! i do n't even want to give this one star , but i guess i have to to get this submitted so i have to put it down :
