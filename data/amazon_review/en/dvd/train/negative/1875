i am a carebear fanatic but ... ... i will have to shoot myself if i am forced to watch this again . the animations are very annoying , the court jesterish feel is very annoying and the portrayal of funshine bear ( my favorite ) as a pre-teenaged boy jokester is not my idea of what carebears is about . i was not impressed with this movie
