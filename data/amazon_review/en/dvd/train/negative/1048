beautiful loser you may ask yourself immediately into the black dahlia , why you are watching an intense promotional boxing match , that goes on for several minutes , between two l.a. police officers . what does it possibly have to do with the real-life murder of a young hollywood hopeful in the 1940 's ? well , nothing really . the movie is overloaded with information , the least of which is sometimes the murder of elizabeth short , whose mutilated body was found like a decrepit piece of sculptured artwork in los angeles in 1947 . the filmmakers deny it in the bonus features , but it 's film noir , with shadowy lighting , intriguing characters , and haunting jazz trumpet score , and on this level , it 's an almost restful and enjoyable film to watch , as characters clearly pay homage to the tough talking guys and alluring exotic femme fatales of '40 's film noir . it 's central theme , however , something concerning hollywood decadence , gets muddled in what seems a conventional and complicated police story , and the emergence of plot lines that rival the main story . it 's pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey resolution is estranged , and it 's multi-storylines collide more than they mesh . director brian de palma 's hitchcockian style works well in seperate entities as opposed to the entirety of the film , and the cast , for the most part , are forever inviting you farther into the film with evolving characterizations , even when you ca n't possibly take on another police bulletin of worthless information . i was never bored for a moment , the film is that sensually stylized , but it is finally grossly unsatisfying , like a playboy magazine without a centerfold , or indeed , an unsolved murder .
