maybe ok for fans of m. night shyamalan not really scary . just loud noises and shots of speeding cars , a spinning fan , and sunsets . oh , there must be some big shocker at the end , right ? not really . there is some notable cinematography and some decent music , but other than that , this was n't even worth a rental for me
