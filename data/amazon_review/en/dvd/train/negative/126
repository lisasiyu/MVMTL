movie for morons this movie is an insult to merely bad comedies . gee , another movie with a fast-talking , potty-mouthed , black guy ( hello eddie murphy ) who , because it 's perfectly fine in ultra-lib , pc hollyweird , calls charlie sheen ( and everyone else who is not black ) a host of nasty , racially-oriented names . the movie is a mess . let 's see . the protagonist ( tucker ) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer , is chased around by cops and the bad guys . the mcguffin is a sack of diamonds . sheen is supposed to be a co-star , but like most of his other movies , he sleepwalks through it . clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for tucker . the sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along . first `` screenwriter '' : '' hey bob , what will we have tucker do next ? hey i know , let 's have a car chase and have him call some people some names '' second `` screenwriter '' `` hey , great idea fred , i sure do n't have any ideas '' . apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip-off of murphy the trickster flicks . basically the plot is tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name . if that 's your idea of humor , i pity you .
