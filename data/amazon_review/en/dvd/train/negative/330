do n't waste your time purchasing this product . i did n't like this video for several reasons . the rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands . i was looking for an aerobic video . i have gilad - bodies in motion which is great but was getting bored with it since i had it for four years . let me just say i 'm sticking with gilad because denise does nothing for me . you do n't even feel like you had a workout with her . she 's boring . i would recommend gilad for aerobics and tamilee webb for toning . tamilee is awesome . i have many of her videos and i 'm a true fan of hers
