ugly american revisited if cruelty , sadism , and abuse are to your taste , then this is the film for you . it is a full-length feature expanded from the bucolic short film , 'fishbelly white ' , but which contains none of its lyricism and rural poetry . duncan is a 14-year-old misfit known for the chickens that he cares for like pets . he is isolated and lonely because his mother has just died , and his mono-syllabic father ignores him . and , in keeping with a time-honored cinematic cliche ( starting with `tea and sympathy ' ) , he is teased , tortured , and threatened by his macho peers for being 'different ' . it seems that he may have a friend in leader-of-the-pack perry but this is where the two versions part company . in the short , they develop a lovely , understated homoerotic romance . here , perry is violent and brutal , like his abusive father , ultimately instigating duncan 's final humiliation . there is not one moment of tenderness in the entire film until the final 'reconciliation ' between duncan and his father but , considering the unrelenting nastiness which has come before , it feels highly contrived . duncan is such a willing , unquestioning `victim ' throughout the film , any resolution-of-conflict which might have raised this to a true coming-of-age story is lost . this is a surprising entry from the usually gay-friendly showtime network . there is nothing friendly about this one .
