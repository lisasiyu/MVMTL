very disapointed when i was considering buying this film , i read all the reviews and though alot of them were negative , i decided to get it anyway because i am a huge fan of jane austen 's books and like bbc 's movies . i was very disapointed after watching it ! this was one of the worst movies i have seen . i could not believe it ! the music was much to modern for time period , and they made the movie much too creepy , whereas the book is much more lighthearted , though there are some dark parts to it . if you 're considering buying this , i would advise against it . i hate to be negative , but watching this movie was a waste of time .
