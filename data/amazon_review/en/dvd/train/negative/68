do n't waste your money ! i bought this dvd thinking i could get what my pilates class gives me right at home . boy was i wrong . this is a horrible example of pilates . the sessions just goes through the motions . they do n't emphasize the importance of form and breathing through out each session which is really needed for any skill level . the transitions are way too fast . maybe i am spoiled by having such a great pilates teacher but this dvd is a waste of money !
