not for babies sorry , but i have to give this dvd a negative review . first of all : what age is it really for ? there are many fragments that introduce spelling and addition . do n't you think it 's a little bit yearly for your 6 months old ( and probably even 3 ) ? the dvd needs much more real life objects , it sounds and looks very dull and boring . i always thought that children learn through play , songs , rhymes , and etc , but not through dull repetition . even alphabet is introduced without well known `` abc song '' . i am giving this dvd two stars because it has nice classical music and it did catch some attention of my 18 months old son ( so far we saw it ones ) . as much more age appropriate material i would recommend : hap palmer `` baby songs : abc,123 , colors & shapes '' ; bee smart baby- vocabulary builder ; baby babble - speech enhancing video ; baby einstein- van gogh ( world of colors ) ; the wiggles- '' toot-toot ''
