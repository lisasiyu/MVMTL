branagh 's frankenstein having taught the book for some years and having admired branagh 's talents as well , i was excited to see what he did with the book . his acting talents are remarkable , again ; the sets are exceptional ; the liberties taken deplorable . he ruined it . killing elizabeth to make the monster lady is laughable . the end of justine is pointless . deniro does not capture the integrity or depth of the monster . minimal script that truncates and eviscerates . horribly disappointed , especially by the maudlin sentimental ending ... bathos supreme . frankly , disgusted . kenneth , what are you doing
