music from the strokes ? no . interviews ? no . good dvd ? no . it 's just one of those things you end up watching at 3 in the morning . but skip this one . you should be sleeping . i am a die-hard strokes fan so when new york stories came out , i had to have it . much to my disappointment , it turned out to contain no music by the strokes , or interviews with any members of the band . if you still feel like you need to see this dvd , do n't pay more than $ 5 for it . you have been officially warned
