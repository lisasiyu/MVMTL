appalling loses its meaning ... ... when applied to this dvd . it would appear to have been transferred from a vhs copy . it 's so soft as to be impossible to watch . i hope the director 's family ( he died in 1970 ) is simply holding back the original masters in hopes of making a deal for an authorized dvd version . `` the red balloon '' is such a wonderful little movie -- perhaps the best introduction to the cinema for any child -- but it is almost destroyed by the condition of the source used for this transfer . ca n't we have a version that matches the film 's vision for its 50th anniversary
