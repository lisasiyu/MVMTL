wolf 's rain part i and part ii i bought i and ii of this released wolf 's rain because when i first read the reviews one of the reviewers claimed there was an alternate ending . i am sooooooooooooo disappointed because now that i have the second part there is no alternate ending and i now see that that review has been deleted . i think amazon handled this whole thing very poorly . we depend on what they provide to help us make our buying choices
