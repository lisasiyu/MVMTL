nothing funny about it jack nicholson is wasted in this movie . he does n't get to be jack , he just plays a watered down characature of himself . but the worst aspect of the movie is the very basis of the story . sandler 's character keeps getting set up and as a viewer you keep wanting a payoff , a reprisal , but the point of the movie is that his character wo n't do it . so you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff . the movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage . i chuckled at 3 throwaway gags in the film ; the rest of the time i kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over
