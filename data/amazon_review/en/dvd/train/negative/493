ho ho now i know ! well it looks like my question regarding why these two `` classic cartoon favorites '' dvd 's are being released in september has been answered ! anywhey being honest , i do own one dvd of this series and that is called `` starring chip n dale '' that is because there has never been a chip and dale collection on dvd before so i own it despite the bad resterration on all of the cartoons
