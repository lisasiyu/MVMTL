there 's no time to change your mind ... the 1st 2 flicks have come on gone ... world at war gets left behind ( pun intended ) . i hoped i 'd never see the day when i 'd have to give an attempted prophecy movie thumbs down , but here we have it . to keep it short and sweet , many of the same characters are present from the 1st 2 films ( which were true to the book ) , however , this poses a great disappointment for fans expecting to see an adaptation of book 3 , as cloud 10 veers away from the continuum of the book series . it 's a story within itself and the story seems to be thrown together . definately not a keeper ... stick to the first 2 and then add the moment after and six : the mark unleashed to your collection instead .
