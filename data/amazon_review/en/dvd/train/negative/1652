what do people see in this show ? i purchased season 1 and thought it was so-so but then as i started watching repeats of seasons 1 and 2 , it dawned on me that this was one terrible show . i think the acting is poor ( but that could be the fault of the scripts and/or the directors ) . speaking of scripts , could the dialogue and scenes be any weaker ? invariably , on each show one of the agents will come into the scene and say `` i have a lead on the car ( or phone number ) . i 'm going to check it out . '' exit scene . i just ca n't believe that real fbi agents act like this quintet . lapaglia 's hair is long , then regulation , then long , then . . .well you get the idea . if there is an actress more sorry than marianne jean-baptiste in a lead role , i have yet to meet her . also , why are these two so argumentative with the relatives or friends of the missing person . i 'm thinking especially of the father of the autistic boy who went missing in a museum . and if it is a husband or wife who went missing , then invariably the question is `` was he ( she ) having an affair ? '' and `` are you having an affair ? '' poppy montgomery , an fbi agent ? come on . first , she has an affair with her supervisor ( lapaglia ) . then she jumps into bed with one of her co-workers ( eric close ) . not in any fbi that i know . at least close and enrique murciano look and act like agents ( and so does montgomery , when she is out of bed ) but they are handicapped by weak scripts and direction . there are better series out there . buy those . do n't buy `` without a trace .
