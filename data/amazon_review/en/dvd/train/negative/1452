awful ! i was astounded that a major studio/star cast could make such a worthless film . the plot is as old as the hills : innocent man wrongfully convicted of murder awaits excecution on death row - innocent man is saved at the last minute by the good guy ( s ) . this movie gives you cheating wives , cheating husbands , irresponsible fathers , paper thin plot , superficial characters , and boring dialog . i totally lost my respect for clint eastwood after viewing this - and & quot ; unforgiven & quot ; is one of my all time favorite films ! how can a person be so inconsistent ? ( i think i know the answer ; it 's called & quot ; a slump. & quot ;
