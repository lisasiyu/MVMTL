not suitable for people with functional cremasters go to www.cremaster.net and download the trailer for the full cremaster cycle . . . . then realize how awesome it looks and how much this dvd sucks . i was wondering where the movie was on this dvd , but then realized you only get a 30 minute clip and can watch lots of alternat shots of the same stuff . the minute long trailer on the website is sooooo much better . highlight : camera movement is kool when it moves all slow and stuff
