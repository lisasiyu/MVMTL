oh god , why ? ! ! ! ! i remember this movie being really , really fun and great when i was 9 . my wife wanted this for our video collection and i hate myself for buying this movie . all i need to know is why she wanted this today ! if you have kids , which we do , they 'll enjoy this for the first time , but after words they 'll be as bored with it as i am . if you are looking for nostalgia , this is the movie , but if you are looking for a good dust collector , buy it quickly
