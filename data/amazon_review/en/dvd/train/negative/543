blecchh ( warning - spoiler ahead ) this was an awful movie . the premise was an obvious rip off an outer limits episode ( straight and narrow ) , but i was curious to see what could be done with the topic in a feature-length format . i was sadly disappointed . the film eliminated everything that was interesting about the outer limits episode , and instead filled itself with ... nothing . in the end the viewer is left with no real reason not to believe the `` bad guys '' about the hormonally induced killing being a temporary and soon to be remedied side effect . by the time the credits rolled , i was not convinced that the microchips were a bad idea , when properly executed , and i do n't think leaving the audience with that ambiguity was the intention of the filmmakers . to sum up : do n't watch this movie . it 's bad . watch the 1990 's outer limits episode , `` straight and narrow , '' starring ryan philippe , instead
