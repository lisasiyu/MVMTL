not up to history channel standard sorry to say this two-pack is not up to history channel usual high standard . dvd 1 , on the spartans ( essentially leading up to thermopylae ) is good . however , dvd 2 is very disappointing . first of all , it has three documentaires , but in fact the first one ( `` the odyssey of troy '' ) and the third one ( `` the trojan city '' ) are carbon copies of each other , which is somewhat of a fraud ... second , the information given by the historians is good , but the narrative itself is more than misleading -- it leaves the viewer with the impression that the trojan horse epic is part of homer 's iliad . it is n't . homer finishes the iliad with the burial of hector . it is in a `` sequel '' so to say , by quintus of smyrna , written many centuries later , that the story of the trojan horse is set down . it is also mentioned in other less complete writings , but certainly not in homer . to be fair , the second documentary in dvd 2 ( `` the ancient gold of troy '' ) is not bad , but does not correct the errors in the other `` two '' segements
