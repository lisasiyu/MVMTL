disapointing action movie i really like wesley snipes and i really like action movies . this movie disappointed on both accounts . i had to wonder what snipes was thinking in doing this film . i still think he is a great actor and could draw people into theaters , so why do a straight-to-video movie . truthfully i did n't even read the cover before renting it because it was wesley snipes but even if i did i would have still rented it . the movie starts out ok with a really ingenious armored car heist , which of course goes bad and turns into a pretty neat car chase . after that , the movie seems to fizzle out . there is not much dialogue and i think the writers put more effort into the heist than the rest of the film . the acting is pretty bad all around , although i think snipes did what he could with what he as given . the directing is frazzled and just plain weird . i did n't like it much at all . i think the director was trying to add action to the film by his style of directing but to me it just made things worse . given the right attention , this movie could have been great but i get the feeling everyone just wanted to get it released as soon as they could . it has potential , but in my opinion , everyone involved in it just fell flat . i had trouble getting through the whole thing . if you are a die hard snipes fan then you might want to rent it , but i do n't give any guarantees as to whether you will like it or not . it just might be worth renting simply to see the beginning because the heist is definitely one of the most intelligent and ingenious i have ever seen . do n't expect much and marvel at the heist and you just might not feel like you 've wasted your time watching it . only buy it if you are an avid fan who must have a copy of every movie your favorite actor has made regardless of how good they are
