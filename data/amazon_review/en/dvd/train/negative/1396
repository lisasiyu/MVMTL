boycott this garbage ! edited music low grade picture and sound ! this is really irritating ! this show ( at least in the early years ) is as good as any show ever was ! the fact that the studio is too cheap to pay for the rights to the music is ridiculous ! to add insult to injury the picture and sound are bargain basement quality ! i think everyone who bought this or any other show that has been altered should return the shows for a full refund . let the cheapskate studio eat the loss instead of making the fans digest this sh**
