not that funny i was expecting a glimpse of some of richard 's funniest acts . the dvd does not do that . it merely interviews people who knew him and give you a glimpse about his career with some takes from some of his stand up shows . i was under the imppression that i am purchasing a dvd that shows some of his funny shows , stand ups and maybe a dvd of something new about richard . ( a never before seen show or something like that ) never the less , he never fails to be the funniest comedian that ever lived .
