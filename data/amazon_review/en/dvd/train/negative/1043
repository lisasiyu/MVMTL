not too bad , but not too good i actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years . i tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes . i was finally in the mood to watch it the other night . let me say i am a big fan of ashley judd and i have loved every movie i have seen her in . she did a great job , as always , just poor script writing . it leaves a lot of questions unanswered , such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms , etc . this fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point ? i may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something i missed ...
