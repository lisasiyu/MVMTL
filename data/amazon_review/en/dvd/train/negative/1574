`` i found him . he 'll be here very shortly . '' henri-georges clouzot 's `` diabolique '' is a film that falls short of its potential . its rather routine resolution undermines its brilliant premise , suffocating atmosphere , and top-notch acting . christina delasalle ( vera clouzot ) and nicole horner ( simone signoret ) conspire to murder michel delasalle ( paul meurisse ) , the director of a boarding school . christina is michel 's wife and nicole is his mistress . both are frequent victims of his abusive nature . the two women carry out their plan perfectly but michel 's body disappears soon after they dispose of it . even more troubling to christina and nicole is that subsequent developments suggest that the murdered man might still be alive . `` diabolique '' is graced with three outstanding performances . meurisse is effectively slimy as the subject of the murderers ' ire while clouzot and signoret are superb as the oddly-matched killers . the film also does a wonderful job of keeping the viewer in suspense once michel 's body disappears . however , the payoff at the end is not worth all the time the viewer has invested in the film . the ending is not clever , shocking , or surprising . it is just plain disappointing . too put it simply , `` diabolique '' is one of those films that runs out of gas before it crosses the finish line .
