augh ! ! ! ! so close , and yet so far . i have been watching swamp fox since i was a kid . unfortunately , one horrible night , i accidently hit the record button when the tape my dad had it on was in the vcr . we lost 2 and a half epidodes ! ! ! ! ! ! maybe 1 and a half , but all the same , i have always grieved the loss . anyhow , my little bro saw this in the store and started dancing . much to my dismay , however , when i investigate it , i find not only not all the episodes , but they are out of order ! ! ! ! ! ! ! how could this happen ? as for elfego ... he is great too . my dad also had him on recordings , and we watched him all the time . so this was a doubly pleasant surprise ... . until i read the details . only 3 bloomin episodes ? ? ? ? ? you have got to be kidding me ! ! and they are out of order as well . disney , you were so close to getting $ 30 of my money , and you just lost it ...
