not too good even with beautiful sandra i admit it . i bought this one because i think sandra bullock is beautiful and she looked nice on the box . i need not have bothered . she is a very minor character with minimal screen time . she does well in her few moments but that is not enough to make this a `` good show '' . the story revolves around a madison avenue type who thinks he has a divine mission to found a new religion . he sets about hsi task with all of the market research tools at his disposal and manages to fleece his flock of much of their disposable income . near the end , he begins to see the light and reforms himself . there are a few brief moments of laughter , a few moments of sandra in briefs but the the redeeming moments are all too brief
