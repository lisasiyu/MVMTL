if this is `` great , '' no wonder the french are exterminating themselves the total absence of normative values makes for tedium , and revulsion , not for greatness . nor even , for that matter , for titillation . when even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference , it becomes easy to see why the french are exterminating themselves , by refusing to reproduce themselves . at the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family , the french nation will be gone in another few generations . this movie will help the viewer see why . sociologically and philosphically interesting , in that it epitomizes the banality of evil , and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig . secularism is devoid of soul , and offers nothing to live for , nothing to live by .
