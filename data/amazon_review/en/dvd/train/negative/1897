just another dvd of legends ... seriousdo n't expect much from this dvd spiderwowan : 0 stars crevices : 4 stars the sacrifice : 2 stars blonde kwaidan : -5 stars ( negative ) presentiment- 1 star the spiderwoman was just weird . like low-budget sci-fi . it lacks an actual plot . * '' crevices '' , although short , was really creepy- i think that some of the others could have been taken out to add on to this one . `` the sacrifice '' -was pretty pointless too . you know someone will die , none of the characters will call the police or try and solve this - it just plays out . frusterating to watch . the lead actress however saves this with above average acting . blonde swaidan - terrible . it 's a few minutes long and makes no sense . an obsession with blondes -finding a blonde body . how did this make it in ? ? `` presentiment '' -a weird kind of `` final destination '' /yogen type of idea here , but it just goes too slow and becomes annoying . by the time you know what 's going on , you do n't care . in summary , `` crevices '' is a scary little short 4 stars , and the acting in `` the sacrifice '' was great , although there was no common sense - do n't know how to score that ...
