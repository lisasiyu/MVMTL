a rip off of scarface and the godfather this movie is a clear rip off of scarface and the godfather . in fact the story is essentially exactly the same as the godfather with the scarface coke empire thrown in . the only difference is that there is the cops view of the events that go down and of course the fact that all of the main characters save one are black . despite the fact that this movie is a blatant rip off i did enjoy it mainly because of wesley snipes acting . other than that its been done before and been done much better
