please enter a title for your review one of the most overrated comedy shows ever . basically the calibre of a high school talent show . in a way it reminds me of tom goes to the mayor , seemingly fitting into a comedy niche i do n't understand which is more about being weird than being clever , but it seems like it 's even more about being dull than being weird . i 've heard improv described as being not about trying to think of something funny to say but just saying whatever comes into your head . i think these guys took that a bit too much to heart . maybe the fans see some subtle naunces i 'm missing , but to me it seems like i could have written most of this material with little effort .
