less enjoyable than `` coffy '' what seemed to have worked so well in `` coffy '' just does n't here . yes , we get to see pam grier , and she 's fine , but the script just does n't give her a whole lot to do . furthermore , the villain in this one just is n't scary , with her overwrought lines and lame `` i 'm in charge '' banter ; the sleazeball from `` coffy '' was better because we did n't know exactly how the chips were going to fall until the very end . that tension is missing here , save for one scene where grier is tortured and abandoned in a gruesome way . we actually get to feel a little tension . however , i still feel that this below-average `` follow-up '' is more than a little disappointing , especially since `` coffy '' really set a high bar , with a great cast driven by a lot of exciting dialogue and plot twists . see this only if you just need to watch another grier vehicle because it 's just not as good
