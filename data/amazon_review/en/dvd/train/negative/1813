fanciful rubbish . this film is so bad that being forced to watch it could be used as a penalty for warcrimes . it is as scientifically realistic as the roadrunner cartoons and has all the character development of a geico commercial . out of the hundreds of films that i have watched in my lifetime , of every stripe and quality , this is the first one that was so utterly vapid and feeble-minded that i began fast-forwarding through simply so that i could see the meteor hit and make the big wave . if this film were a sexual encounter , both partners would have fallen asleep during the foreplay . life is far too precious to waste on this skanky turtle of a film .
