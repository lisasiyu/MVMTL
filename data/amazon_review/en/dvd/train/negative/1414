plum must be turning in his grave ! unlike the first three seasons , which were nothing short of brilliant , this season seems to have lost the wodehouse touch . the absolute low point was a madcap chase up the empire state building ; both bertie and jeeves were completely out of character . i got through the set just once and re-sold it almost immediately . i highly recommend the first three sets , but if you 're a wodehouse purist , pass on this fiasco
