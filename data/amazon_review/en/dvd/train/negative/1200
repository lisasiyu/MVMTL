i agree with the first two reviewers the first two reviewers did a great job of describing the storyline , so i wo n't go there . i 'll tackle the ending ... what ending ? i even backed it up to see what i missed . then , i went to the special features to see an alternate ending . it varied little from the shows ending . after investing the time to see this movie , i hated the ending . however , jacqueline bisset is still very lovely . adam garcia did n't too badly and i did like the sounndtrack so there were a few saving graces ...
