not at all what i expected cradle to grave was , for me , a let down . i expected to see more jet li action . he seemed held back , as if he could not fully express his abilities . it appears as though he did not want to `` show up '' the other actors . as much of a jet li fan as i am , i regret to say that this move disapointed me . bmx and jet li did not fit together well . i think that jet li 's part could almost have been anybody else . the story also disapointed me . it did not seem right that a cop , ( from tiwan ) and a thief got together to save the world . it did n't make sense .
