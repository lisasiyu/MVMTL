the devil 's in the details mostly notorious when it was released in 1987 for featuring wholesome sitcom star lisa bonet in a sex scene with some nudity ( and thereby supposedly offending bill cosby ) , angel heart has acquired quite a reputation as a cult film since then , some of which is quite deserved for its astonishingly beautiful cinematography and editing . some of the compositions ( particularly two repeated overhead shots of stairwells , one in harlem and one in new orleans ) are among the most stunning of any film from the 1980s , and the set decorations are similarly out of this world . though there 's also mickey rourke 's beautiful youthful face ( pre-boxing injuries ) to be gazed upon , there 's really little else to recommend this movie , even if its big twist at the end catches you unawares : the film is basically constructed as a rebus , with various visual ( seeming ) non sequiturs keying you in to the big narrative surprise at the end . but the big horror moments have almost no suspense built into them , and the acting is fairly shoddy : o'rourke gives a real hambone performance , and bonet must be the dullest voodoo priestess ever to appear onscreen . you know what you 're in for when the characters have names like `` harry angel , '' `` louis cyphre , '' `` toots sweet , '' and `` epiphany proudfoot '' ; even the beautiful look of the film ca n't overcome the shallowness and dispiritedness of the script
