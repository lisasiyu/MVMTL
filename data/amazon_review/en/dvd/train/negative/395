did i miss something ? i saw this movie about 20 years ago when it was on cinemax . i fell asleep while watching it then . i bought the dvd as part of the controversial classics set , and was looking forward to seeing the parts i missed . this time , i fell asleep twice watching it ; it took a total of three nights to see it all . i found it just as talky and heavy-handed as i did when i saw it back in college . further , i did n't pick up on any chemistry between the leads , and found james coburn 's character loud and annoying . finally , the great mgm hairstylist sidney guillaroff was way off the mark on this one . almost all of the women had mid-60 's hairdo 's that were distracting , particularly miss andrews , whose distracting poofie 'do often changed from shot to shot within the same scene . i get it ; war is bad . nevertheless , this film did little for me . it did , however , look very nice ; the dvd transfer was well done
