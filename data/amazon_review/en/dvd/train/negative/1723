are you serious ? i watched this movie with my 7 year old daughter , and regretted it about 10 minutes in . after reading queen bees & wannabees , i ca n't help but despair whenever i look over the precipice and get a glimpse into teen girl world . in barbie 's envisioning of this world the central theme is to `` be yourself '' , but in the end they only seek themselves in a banal existence of dress shopping , chasing each others ' boyfriends , inventing lip gloss disguised as a highlighter , deciding what to wear to an afternoon of watching cute boys practice football , and halfheartedly pursuing a career as a rock star . while i realize that this is teenage girl reality , is this what needs to be held up to pre-teens as a personality blueprint ? the popular girls look exactly like the unpopular girls , so it 's not like the criteria for who gets to set foot on the `` popular lawn '' is really clear , other than you have to be mean-spirited and backstabbing . but at least they somewhat captured the spirit of what it 's like to be on the outside looking in . of course , there 's the `` magic diary '' aspect of the story , which seemed the only tie to the `` other '' barbie world ( fairytopia , mermadia , et all ) . i realized then what i was really watching ... a marketing cry for help from mattel . the target demo for barbie has shrunk to 3-6 year old girls , and they 're trying desperately to expand back into the 7-11 range that other brands like bratz are chipping away at . i promptly dumped all mattel stock from my 401k .
