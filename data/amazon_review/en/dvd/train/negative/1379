a bad sequel . stephen king is the master of writing , and when he wrote the original story : pet sematary , he was on his game , in the zone , and the man . this second movie is someones attempt at cashing in on the original works of the king , and has been poorly done . did , stephen write a second novel ? no . he has so many other stories that they could make into movies , why spend the money on something like this second film . it was a dive-bomb in theaters , that should tell you something . bad -- just bad .
