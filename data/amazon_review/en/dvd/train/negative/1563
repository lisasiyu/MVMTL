boring , like watching snow melt ... the snow queen is an ancient story from northern europe about a beautiful lady with a heart of ice who resides near the north pole , and uses winter to take the lives of innocent human beings , and uses her beauty and charm to seduce innocent men . live action movies and cartoon versions of this story have been made in numerous decades in multiple languages . one of the later ones is this 3 hour version by hallmark entertainment . taking place somewhere in scandinavia ; most likely denmark , the setting is a small rural village in the mid 20th century . a father loses his wife to winter , and raises his daughter at their hotel . one day , he hires kai , a young man , to help with labor around the hotel . he and the daughter fall in love , but the snow queen steals kai away . the daughter sets forth on a journey across earth and the four seasons to find the lair of the snow queen to rescue kai . the movie 's story is quite good and offers much promise . but the movie drags too much ; the dialogue is often muted , and the snow queen is somewhat wooden ; not enough emotion . the idea of a beautiful queen of ice is done much better in the chronicles of narnia than here , as bridget fonda does not do much talking at all . the idea of the robbed girl having to travel across the spring , summer and autumn to find kai is quite innovative and only possible by the crew of hallmark , but again it was not done well . the action scenes were somewhat fake , and most importantly , the snow in the winter scenes clearly looked like fake snow . overall , a good attempt but a bad result .
