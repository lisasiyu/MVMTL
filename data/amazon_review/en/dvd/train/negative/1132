total utter nonsense ! ! ! ! ! ! this is pure drivel ! ! ! ! ! clearly there was some kind of argument behind this film ; like the director wasnt given enough money to make it , so he thought , you know what , im going to spite the film company by making a hideousely awful film , that 'll show them.the & quot ; plot & quot ; , if i can re-tell it without vomiting , is thus : a plane is struck by lightning , and kills all the pilots ... ... ... ... ..i kind of lost what was going on after that ... ... the ending , if there actually was one , was that whatever predicament they were in , they got out of.where can i begin ? ? ? ? ? clearly no one involved with this project has any knowledge of basic physics , as they 'd have pointed out that this isnt possible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! im a little bit rusty on my physics , but isnt it called a faraday coil ? ? ? if not then forgive me , my minds a little indestinct , but the main point is a bolt of lightning wont pass through a plane . & quot ; what about the glass , it passed through the glass window ! ! ! & quot ; you bark smugly , well thick glass used for this wouldnt allow electric current to pass through it.think about it people , you ever been hit by lightning indoors ? ? have you ever heard of this happening in real life before ? ? no , because it cant ! ! ! ! ! ! well done , you 're learning.anyway , enough of the banter , the film struggles from then on in.for some bizzare reason the plane operated by a laptop , the cable ( ? ? ! ! ) for which has broken.it only works by some guy holding it with venom.factor into this some wierd pregnant woman type nonsense , some shouting passengers/helpful people arguing rubbish , a hint of romance between a & quot ; criminal & quot ; and a & quot ; female human being & quot ; , and you have this godawful tripe of a film.some wonderfully hilarious moments.guy says & quot ; i skipped bail & quot ; , & quot ; are you a criminal ? & quot ; she asks ! ! ! ! ! ! well of course he is you stupid fool , he just told you ! ! ! ! any time there was & quot ; turbulence & quot ; the camera was wobbled about a bit , and the & quot ; actors & quot ; moved around unconvincingly.the terrible news report segments , where hilarity prevailed every time.the bit when the dog jumped out the car , that was brilliant ! ! ! ! he pushed it over a bit then it was half dead ... then later he gave the oxygen mask , great ! ! ! ! ! all the scenes involving the radar room , they were something else ! ! ! ! the ending also , the rubbish cgi aeroplane , what a laugh ! ! ! ! i could go on and on and on , pointing out rubbish but funny things about this film , but i think ive said enough.in short , dont come to watch this if you want a coherent engaging film.but if you enjoy laughing through mind-bogglingly bad trash , then this is definately for you ! ! ! ! i laughed nearly all the way through it , so at least it was entertaining.1 out of 5
