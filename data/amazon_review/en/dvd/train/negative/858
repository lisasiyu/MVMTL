do n't buy this compilation ... ... these 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in chinese cinema and definetly for jet li and movie kung fu . however , i watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which does n't have english subs ( i do n't mind , but every other dvd i have ever seen has this ) also , in the first ten minutes , there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations . for some reason , cousin yi is now aunt 13 and chu 's bird is now chu 's beard . this is crap . do not buy this , buy the movies seperately , you can probably find them each for 9 bucks , and they would be more satisfying that way
