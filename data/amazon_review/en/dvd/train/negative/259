a total waste of time and money - its a movie full of lies i watched this movie and found nothing but bundles of lies . he did his best not to divide india and it was all jinnah who divided and founded pakistan . gandhi was totally against it . in short - wasted my money . i would rather be watching a silly comedy show . that must have been atleast better than this movie .
