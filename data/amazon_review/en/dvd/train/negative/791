awful ... as a made for tv movie that comes on in the middle of the day on a saturday afternoon that you watch because you do n't feel like changing the channel , it was okay . as the sequel to gwtw or the screen adaptation of the book i enjoyed reading so much , it was appallingly awful . the acting was weak , and the woman that played scarlett was mildly attractive at best . it was a complete waist of time and money
