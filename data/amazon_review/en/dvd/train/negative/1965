two problems about this dvd i give it one star for the dvd . i give the movie 5 stars or more if i could . starting out is , everyone who is a die hard fan of this movie knows this is suppose to be a widescreen motion picture . hell even on tnt high definition tv , they aired it in the right aspect so i had to tape it because ive never got to see it in its actual aspect . second of all the box art gives the whole movie away . being reason i say this is because of the poster art of the movie and the old warner vhs tape shows no sign of what kind of creature is cujo . i know it might not be a big deal to some people but when i first rented this movie , i was so curious about what cujo was , the box art and original theatrical poster art was so unique that you were guessing what kind of horror is this . well i know people are going to say , read the book dummy and you will know . well i am not a book reader but i was so excited to know what kind of killer was cujo and was a dog , i kinda had a hunch though . this movie is fantastic . one of those kinds that you could just sit there and feel that everything on the show was really actually happening and not just acting . that is a good movie ! one last thing . dont go buying this peice of junk dvd . wait until warner releases the true format and maybe some extra features to go along . they did it with the classic . lost boy
