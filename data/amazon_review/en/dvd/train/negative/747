terrible movie from start to finish a total waste of time . i viewed this movie with some of the single women from my church including a recently married woman , we were all appalled at how desparate this `` pamela '' was note to the director not all women waiting on god are that desparate . the so called christian principals in this movie were laughable . at the end of the movie i found myself apologizing to my guests for wasting their time
