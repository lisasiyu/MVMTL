sorry , but i 'm not falling for it i do n't know what walmart these girls came from , but the ones i 've been to only seem to staff homely , short , fat , goblin-like women . i smell a deception here . there 's absolutely no way in h*ll that girls which look like this would have such a job . you 'd find them working at espresso booths or something , where all the babes seem to be . i think in this case playboy is appealing to our `` fantasies '' of seeing `` regular girls from walmart-type jobs '' naked , but they could n't possibly have found such quality at one of the actual stores .
