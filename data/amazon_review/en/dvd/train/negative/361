if you 'll laugh at absolutely anything , then you may like this this is your standard , generic , run-of-the mill comedy , with ben stiller doing his usual pratfalls etc . and jennifer anniston doing her best to look as unattractive as possible . stiller marries some woman , they go to some tropical island for their honeymoon , he catches her having sex with some guy , and he goes back to new york depressed . then he meets polly , and they have absolutely nothing in common . they go through the usual problems ( yawn ) , then at the end they sort of get together , i guess . if you 'll laugh at absolutely anything , i mean , if you still find knock-knock jokes hilarious , then you may find this amusing . truthfully , it 's a lousy , unfunny script , these people have absolutely no comedic sense , and the pratfalls and slapstick shenanigans all fall pretty much flat . there 's nothing worse than watching a movie where you 're sitting there thinking , `` oh , that was supposed to be funny '' , and not laughing . do you find it hilarious that a fat guy falls down on a freshly waxed floor , even though he obviously did n't slip or anything ? do you find it amusing when someone speaks in a really , really thick accent so you can barely understand him ? are you left in stitches when someone asks their looney best friend to do a serious business presentation for them , and they act like a complete loon ? i mean , come on . this crap was old when they were doing it on the carol burnett show 30 years ago . anyhow , if you 're completely satisfied just watching whatever lightweight , brainless fluff happens to be rolling across your television screen at any particular moment in time , then you 'll probably be no more or less satisfied with this than anything else . it 's probably better than reruns on the cooking channel , but only by the slimmest of margins
