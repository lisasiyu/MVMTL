it had potential with great music and a setting that reminds you of `` vampire hunter d '' it sucks you into watching the series . the plot turns out to be terrible and the idea of where the wolves came from and where they are going is underdeveloped and disappointing . the animation is good , which is a must have for me , but it was n't enough to redeem the series
