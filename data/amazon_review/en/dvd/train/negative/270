mostly uneventful and somewhat pretentious i like glenn gould . i did n't care for this movie however . 1 ) the actor does not look like glenn at all in my opinion , which i find distracting . 2 ) its very disjointed , and a lot of the components offer very little insight about glenn or his life . one scene was glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people 's conversations . big deal , this is not interesting . i know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality , but it 's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking . another example ; glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady . thats it . why is this interesting ? someone could film my uncle in wal mart , but would you care ? hey , look ... my uncle carl is buying batteries . now he is putting his change in his pocket . how utterly profound ... . in my opinion , you will learn and understand more about glenn gould by listening to his music than watching this lackluster , uneventful movie
