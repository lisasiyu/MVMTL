hold your nose i thought colin was sleeping at first . i did n't realize he was `` acting sensitive '' . it would be more interesting to watch paint dry , than this slow , boring , pointless movie . so , his friend is gay , big suprise , and colin movies to new york to live with him and kooky girl . who ever thought robin wright could look ugly ? she used to be an attractive girl , i guess living with sean penn must be very stressful . you probably guessed the plot - kooky girl really loves gay friend , but colin shows up and she sleeps with him gets preggy and they all move to hooterville and live the `` unconventional life '' thats even more boring than living in the `` burbs '' . they are the most conventional `` unconventional '' bores of all time . either overdose on black coffee or skip this one . for extreme colin fans only . enjoy !
