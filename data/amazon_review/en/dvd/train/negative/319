awful , horrible , ridiculous . i can not get thru this one . i started fast-forwarding but there did n't appear to have any good spots . when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this , i thought , this has to be good . i had just finished a movie where he starred . ca n't remember the name of it . i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it . tori spelling is well known , but not to me . someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start . she does not play a flake very well , and i do n't know what to call her except a flake . i stopped this dvd in about the first 1/2 hour and will go back and give it another shot , but with tori spelling as one of the leads , i already know this one does not have a prayer . i would say ; save your money on this one unless you are under 13. i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that do n't . this one falls into this category . one that came with this one was `` the broken hearts club '' and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage .
