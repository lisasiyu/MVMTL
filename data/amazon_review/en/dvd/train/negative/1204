sigh what a great premise and start to the movie as most of the world 's children fall into a coma . 10 years later , no children are born that do n't fall into the same coma . the stock market crashes , riots , the world is uneasy . then the children wake up and they are out for blood . sounds great , and the children first waking up is really scary . then the story just falls apart , and the ending is just stupid . nothing is really explained , and you are left empty at the end . no real gore and average acting . clive barker 's name is attached , but he certainly did not write this
