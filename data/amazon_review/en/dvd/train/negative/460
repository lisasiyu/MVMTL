no title well , i sure could have skipped this one . i well remember the critics raving over this on television , but why is beyond me . mostly , i was just plain bored . there simply was no depth at all , just bunches of short takes and wise cracks . bush was just downright dirty , making insults and slurs all over the place , something i do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be president . and it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that mary matalen , the deputy manager of bush 's campaign and very acid-tongued ( maybe she wrote some of the slurs bush used ) , is now the wife of james carville , top strategist for clinton 's campaign , and basically the star of the movie . but all the scenes were focused on the funny quip , the bon mot , no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work , or any answers to any questions about clinton either , for that matter .
