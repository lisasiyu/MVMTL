never ! the last song in it was not written by rodgers and hart . it was i think written by roger edens ( of judy garland fame ? ) , and is a mediocre imitation of hartesque rhymes , at least in its feverish attempt at multiple rhymes at the start . several of the songs from the stage show were left out , as were all the verses . extra lyrics ( not by hart ) were added to `` the most beautiful girl in the world '' for durante to sing and martha 's raye 's `` the circus is on parade . '' songs from other r & h shows were interpolated . did someone high up like god know better than r & h what songs should be in a r & h show ? finally , and absolutely humiliating for martha raye and i suspect doris day had a hand in it but maybe not , the line sung by doris `` two feet are ever cold '' is followed by martha raye with `` four feet are never cold '' which in turn is followed by an embarrassed flustered `` i only mean to imply '' by raye . goodness . she said something wrong . i am beginning to dislike doris day intensely . she disgusts me . the title of this shocking little song is `` why ca n't i ? '' also not from the original show and with much excised . the story ( such as it is ) is a predictable drag . the dvd is cheap on amazon ( until you add postage ) , it 's a flat $ 20 everywhere else + tax . if you must , buy it from amazon . i would n't take it for free . this is truly wholesome family entertainment , and that 's about as nauseous a recommendation as i can give it . if you like rodgers and hart , forget it . durante was in the original on stage . i gave it 2 stars for the pretty tunes ( and almost roger edens ' ) .
