happy birthday mom okay , let me explain the title . i call this review happy birthday mom because in the middle of the movie i stopped the movie to call my mom and wish her a happy birthday . the typical thought would be that i bought this dvd for my mother as a birthday gift , but i do like my mom , so i would n't do that to her . later in the movie i also stopped it to talk to my friend that lives in canada . yeah , i stopped it to talk to a canadian , thats bad ... . well he 's just up there for school , so ya know . some of it was good , but it could have done better . i have the seemingly harder to come by skill of seperating fiction ( movie , game , tv ) from real life , so i like the kind of shat that upsets fragile people without that skill . i 'm sure some of the violence in this movie made someone cry foul ... . and its gets and extra half star simply because kari wuhrer is hot in this movie , like every movie she 's in !
