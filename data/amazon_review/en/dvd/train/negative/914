movie is great - this dvd release is horrible do n't buy this . seriously . someone is bound to release a better version . this is pan and scan , cropped at 1:33 , and seems to be transferred from some sort of used tape ... like a 3/4 inch vhs . there are visible tape flutters and wrinkles throughout the film . and no it 's not the print . the film is fine . it 's the transfer . cheap , cheap , cheap . the compression is abysmal ( notice the obvious scan lines on the titles ) and the sound is piss poor . how is it possible this is the only way this film is available in the us ? disgraceful
