ugh . does n't deserve stitch 's name ! wow , this movie was awful . i am a huge fan of `` lilo & stitch '' so naturally i bought this movie sight unseen . looks like disney is just cashing the sequel checks with children being their primary target . very low quality story . stick with saturday morning cartoons -- at least they 're free
