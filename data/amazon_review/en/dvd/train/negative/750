a lot of trouble for nothing . the characters in this book and production are its downfall . the young lady owner sees someone take her diamond . she has access to this person ; it is someone she knows . why not just ask this person to give the diamond back ? why not ask `` why did you take it ? '' why condemn this person without giving him or her a chance to speak ? this stupid girl ( rachel is her name ) soured me on the whole book ! this is not the way that people would really act in this situation . collins asks readers to suspend disbelief too much . if rachel had spoken up , she could have saved others , like sargent cuff a lot of trouble
