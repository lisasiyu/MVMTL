formidable research . deeply flawed conclusions . i genuinely wanted to like this book . however , the arguments put forward are so deeply biased by goldhagen 's strong views on the subject as to be worth little in granting the reader greater understanding of the holocaust . it does n't read like a history book and i was n't surprised to learn ( afterword ) that the author is not a historian . that said , there is value in reading it . the book is rich in facts and detail , the result of some indepth research . however , the way the author uses ( and abuses ) these facts left me wanting to stop reading in frustration . the book is filled with 'post hoc ergo propter hoc ' arguments and mental gymnastics designed to prove goldhagen 's hypothesis . millions of non-jewish victims are for the most part ignored in this work , but it still can be worth a read . but , only if you are not put off by reptitive , awkward prose and are prepared to seperate the rich collection of data from the author 's emotionally driven interpretations
