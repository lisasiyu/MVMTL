substandard text or reference on rf electronics . this is a required text for a graduate level rf electronics course i am taking . i am very disappointed with this text . there are multiple mistakes and misprints throughout . it seems that the book was proofed by someone who is not familiar with electronic symbology and notation . there are many instances where inconsistant notation will be used within a single example problem ! the author is very short on many subjects and longwinded on others . this book makes for a confusing and frustrating read despite the distinguished ieee brand on the cover . my professor even commented on the sloppyness of the author . i have had to buy additional books to suppliment my studies . this is not a good reference or text book ... .coming from someone who has read multiple technical text books ... beware of this one
