unbelievable cast of characters short version : a half dozen scientists and engineers are working in the arctic , attempting to use explosives to create a huge iceberg that can floated to someplace in dire need of fresh water . they become marooned and only have a few hours before the explosives they 've planted go off and kill them . however , a russian sub may be able to save them . koontz had the right idea when he originally released this book under a pseudonym , because it 's a stinker . the set-up building to the scientists being stranded and the deadline imposed by the explosives is unbelievable . suffice it to say that a natural disaster hundreds of miles away just happens to target the exact location of where the scientists are working . additionally , they 've planted explosives in the ice that are on timers and ca n't be switched off . besides suffering from incompetence , the characters have unbelievably bad luck ( beyond being targeted for destruction by mother nature , that is ) : -one is highly phobic , terrified of ( you guessed it ) : ice & snow ( because of an accident that killed her parents ) ! -another 's family was murdered in china -another 's had close relatives assasinated while in office and is disillusioned by politics ( a thinly disguised jfk jr ? ) -another lost his son to cancer -another 's psychotic if that 's not bad enough , the main characters are a husband and wife team who run the project . she had a relationship with another scientist that ended badly before getting married to the current guy . so who does her husband pick to spend months on ice with ? why the ex-boyfriend of course ! because he was the best at what he did ( excuse me , would n't second best have made more sense ? ) if you do n't mind really bad dialog and trite situations , give this book a try . if you want a really intense adventure/thriller try wilbur smith 's `` hungry as the sea '' or anything by nelson demille
