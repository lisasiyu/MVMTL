unsatisfying on multiple levels most of the people looking at this book most likely already have an interest in women 's studies , feminism , and the like . if that 's you , you 're going to be disappointed . you could already guess the author 's point and what she 's going to say , and she offers it all up without any interesting insights . if you 're just interested in stripping , you 'll also be disappointed , because there 's nothing particularly compelling about her story or the `` back stage '' scenes she offers . if you 're familiar with eaves 's reporting , from slate magazine and such , you 'll already be familiar with her style -- superficial analysis and lack of compelling argument or detail . skip this book -- there are better feminist analyses of stripping out there , and there are much more interesting stripper `` tell-all '' autobiographies as well .
