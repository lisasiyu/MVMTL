best of the 4-volume set but ... . this is the best starting book for anyone who wants to delve into hypnosis . but it is often available as used book only and is the first in a 4-vol set . but soon ( sometime in early 2006 ) , there will be a 8-vol ( yes , 8 books in a set ) set in a single cd that also comes with audio and bonus video and at $ 75 ! back about this book ... it tells you experiments and findings of tests conducted on hypnotized subjects and how they react to suggestions by the `` hypnotizer '' and also what happens when they are told to do things ( while in trance ) that they would not do in normal consciousness . the sections on trance and suggestions are excellent ; perhaps the best overview of trance and how suggestions work . much of the material is suitable for a hypnotherapist to use in a pre-talk to trance induction
