worst . book . ever . this book is awful . i read it , and i could n't wait to finish it . i would have flipped it in the trash can except i had to read it for school . the characters are pathetic , there is no grasp of dialogue , and the author admits that it is the same thing as an f. scott fitzgerald book that was already written . how it became a newberry winner i will never know
