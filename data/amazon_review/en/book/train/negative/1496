if your not catholic do n't buy this book before i got married i really excited to incorporate irish customs and traditions . i was so happy when i received this book , until i started reading it . do n't get me wrong it is a very interesting book . but although my husband and i are of irish decent , being what would be concidered protestant christians i was unable to incorporate any of the blessings or ideas for readings , since they were all meant for a catholic wedding . if you want history buy the book . if you 're catholic buy the book . for the rest of us . . .save your money for your honeymoon
