oops -- honan 's errors i found 23 factual errors in honan 's book -- when i mentioned this to someone i was told that a reader in virginia had found 142 . there are much better biographies of jane austen out there -- for starters , no one has yet surpassed elizabeth jenkins ' , first published in the 1930s , and a fine recent one , a good introduction to ja 's life , is maggie lane 's latest , jane austen 's world . do n't be put off by the fact that it is slick and , as they say , richly illustrated -- it 's readable , sound and remarkably complete despite its size
