judson would be a demagogue , if he could get your attention . i would have given this no stars if it were an option . the first 20 pages of this book bored and insulted me . judson drones on about every fraud known to mankind , but only occasionally scientific fraud . he seems to hope that if we hear enough examples of fraud in the world , we will get fired up and join him in a lynching . his tone is condescending and assumes that you already agree with him . this is not the type of academician that you could hope to have a meaningful conversation with . he laces his information with references to `` the epidemic '' of fraud and nobody being `` immune '' to it , as if by the weight of these descriptive terms you will be swept into his inevitably correct conclusions . i suspect that judson would have presented a more objective book if he had more worthwhile information to offer .
