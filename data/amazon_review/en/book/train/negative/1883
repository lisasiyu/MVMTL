very disappointing unless you 're in the ( junior ) target demographic if you are a teenager or student in your early 20s and are fascinated with the big mysterious world of i-banking , this book is for you . it starts from ground zero and provides a cursory explanation of what investment banking is , along with some guidance on career paths in the field . if you are anyone else , forget it . as i struggled to maintain interest , i could n't help but be reminded of a scene from the movie `` back to school '' , where paxton whitehead plays a b-school professor lecturing his class on how to start a business and rodney dangerfield plays a veteran businessman with no formal education . as whitehead 's character is pontificating about the nuances of how global interest rates affect the construction costs that a hypnothetical business will incur , dangerfield 's character ca n't help but blurt out `` why in the world would you build when you can rent in this market for half a buck a square foot and let someone else have the headaches of property management ? '' . it quickly becomes apparent that the real-world experience of dangerfield 's character is far more useful than the off-topic theoretical knowledge of the professor . this author reminds me of whitehead 's character : thoroughly vetted in academia and obviously having zero experience in the real world , and thus having zero useful real-world insight to share with his readers . the most-cited references in the chapter bibliographies are the annual reports of the big i-banks , and the rest of the book is written at the same naieve , glossy-overview level . in summary , if you want to know what it 's like to serve in the navy , you can get yourself a copy of the navy 's glossy brochure on what navy careers are supposed to be like , or you can find a vet who 's been in the navy to tell you what it 's really like . reading this book is like reading the navy 's glossy brochure .
