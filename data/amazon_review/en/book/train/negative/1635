not what i expected i think this book should have been entitled over 60 and gettin ' stronger . i 'm 46 and i was really looking forward to getting this book in the mail . i think it is more geared to people over 60 . quite a few of the models were much older . i wo n't get a lot out of this book as far as exercises go . quite a lot of the exercises were n't using dumbbells . you get the impression from the cover that the exercises will be heavily geared to using dumbbells but this is n't the case . i was disappointed with this book . i recommend weight training for dummies which gives you excellent information and exercises to do . and also , smart girls do dumbbels by judith sherman-wolin . that book is loaded with dumbbell exercise .
