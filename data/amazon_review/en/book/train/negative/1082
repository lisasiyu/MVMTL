twisted freudian interpretation of an american icon if a reader were to believe the many ludicrous claims that adams makes about thomas eakins , one would think that the artist was homosexual , heterosexual , bisexual , and a pedophile , exhibitionist , voyeur , sadist , and masochist ; and further , that he practiced incest and bestiality ( all of which , adams suggests , was driven by a desire to posses his own mother ) . take your pick ! adams covers all the bases . eakins is not so much `` revealed '' in this book as he is `` concealed . '' he seems to ignore altogether , what to my mind , are the most fascinating things about this remarkable man : that he studied logarithms for fun , that science , not art , was his first love , that he was conversant in five languages , and that he found beauty where others saw ugliness . among the more humorous assertions that adams makes about eakins is that the artist painted while sitting on the floor ( he used an easel ) , that he shot his sister 's cat for fun ( adams conveniently leaves out the fact that eakins ' father ordered him to do so because the animal was rabid ) , and that he painted clergymen because they wore dresses , which supposedly reminded eakins of outfits his dead mother wore . after reading this dreadful book i came to actually like it as a study of how inbred ( dare i say incestuous ? ) that some members of our academic community have become . even if you are convinced , or want to believe that abraham lincoln was homosexual , you will still have difficulty making the creative leaps necessary to take this book seriously
