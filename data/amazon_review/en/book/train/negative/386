what happened ? ? ? ? ? i have never written a review of a book before , but after reading this book i felt i had too . what happened to this series . the first two books were great , but this book dose n't even come close to being as good . somebody should have cut about 300 pages from this book . the first two books in the series i could'nt put down , but this book was very difficult to finish . i dont think i will read the 4th volume in this never ending series
