ripped off ! ! i could n't believe that i bought this crap . i did n't learn anything from this book . it has so little content . most of the book is an appendix listing the stocks on the nasdaq . this is most likely an attempt to make money from the day trading craze . i bought this because of the last few glowing recommendations but they must have been paid to write it . do n't buy this book . there are better ones out there that provides better details on day trading
