blue light walter mosley is normally a detective writer , known for his easy rawlins stories . blue light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age . various people in northern california are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird . according to the book 's cover flap , the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes . however in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality . a smart girl becomes really smart , a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja , and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess . mr mosley is a talented writer . his prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable . unfortunately there 's little balance between good and evil , which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter . even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting . there 's a few great and captivating scenes in this book , but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself
