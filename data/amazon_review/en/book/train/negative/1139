repeat i bought this hoping to add to my collection of judy reeves 's prompts , unfortunately all this is is a repackaging of a writer 's book of days : a spirited companion and lively muse for the writing life . the year 's worth of prompts are in the kit 's book , followed by lined pages . the advice and encouragement on the kit 's cards can be found among the pages of her writing book of days . i 'm very disappointed that reeves could n't create more prompts rather than simply making more money off of her previous work
