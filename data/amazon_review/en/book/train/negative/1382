2.5 stars , tops . the reviewer who states this book is a disappointment is dead on . i 'm a fan of blair and eagerly awaited this book 's arrival . i 'm astounded at the amount of work not represented here , especially considering the price . blair was an amazing colorist and the poor reproductions do n't do her work justice
