short and sweet judging by the long reviews before me , it should be obvious that there is much to say about calvin 's theology . this book does n't say too much . for those familiar with his theology , do n't buy this book . it will be a waste of your money . for those who would like to know more about calvin 's theology , without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology , buy this . if you want a good in depth coverage of calvin 's theology , buy the full version and enjoy
