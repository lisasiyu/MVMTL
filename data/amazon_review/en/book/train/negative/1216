do n't buy this book i thought this book was about the autobiography of benjamin franklin . this is not the book i was thinking about . it was a book written by benjamin franklin but which is written after he wrote his famous autobiography . the book did not contain the contents of his autobiography but contains his writings that were written during his last years that was not included in his widely read autobiography . the book title says it is 'compleated ' autobiography . the book 's title should be 'last memoirs of benjamin frankilin
