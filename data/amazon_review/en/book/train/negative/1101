nothing special i do not quite understand why this should be a recommended buk-book . it is a fairly interesting interview , alright . but if you 're going to spend money on bukowski : buy his books . and if you want biographical information , go with howard sounes . to get a real good look on bukowski you also might want to check out the 'bukowski-tapes ' - film-interviews by barbet schroeder . pivano 's interview reveals nothing new is not really worth the money
