national geographic should be ashamed . this slap dash compilation of short descriptions was probably put together as a quick way to make a few bucks . the authors are indeed esteemed but i bet each one wrote their part from memory on a sunday afternoon . the battle descriptions are dry and confusing -- most of the maps are useless in determining the sequence of events . geography seems to be sort of thrown in as a catchy way to snare amateur buffs like myself . i usually read reviews before i buy a book and this time i just & quot ; assumed & quot ; good quality due to the national geographic society imprimatur . stay away
