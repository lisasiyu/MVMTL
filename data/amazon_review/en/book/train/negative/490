great reads ruined by horrible characters the other reviewers will tell you about the book . i 've read most of preston and child 's works , including the other two books in this trilogy , and they are a good read . what gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism . i guess it 's a necessity to get published today , but you 'd think that at least some male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published . i guess most people will sell their souls for money . just about all the men in p and l 's books are either wimps , effiminate , weak , bumbling , stupid ( or liars or murderers ) , cry-babies , scared of their own shadows , and thoroughly unlikable ( even pendergast has his moments ) . the women , of course , are , without exception , tough , brilliant , shrewd , fearless , always right , on the rise to the top , always outsmarting the men , able to knock out a 7 foot , 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck ( forgive the slight hyperbole ) , totally unfeminine , and just as unlikeable as the men . the stories are very good ; it 's unfortunate preston and child could n't have come up with better , more realisticly human , less insulting characters . this slop may play in new york and california , but in texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women . so this is just a warning . if you 're a man -- and those of you who are know what i mean -- you 'll get sick of the characters in these books .
