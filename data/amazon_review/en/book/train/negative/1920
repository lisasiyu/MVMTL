an effort not reaching a good result the book is written with the purpose to be an `` up-to-date [ source about ] dc/dc converters for students and practicing professionals '' . it is a shame how this target is not reached . since from the very begin , the introduction , you will face an answer : what is its usefulness ? you 'll hope that , going on reading , everything will be clearer , and , from a certain point of view , this is what you get : what you 've seen in introduction is eventually explained so that it could be useful even to students . however the text neither is `` practical '' nor gives you the `` in-depth-analysis '' you were hoping since its title begins with `` advanced '' . schematics are rarely useful to understand the following analysis and are often badly sketched/printed . mathematical derivations are quite good but not enough to fulfill designers needs . apart from this it is a good effort . in my opinion readers should have to wait the next edition , if there will be a next edition
