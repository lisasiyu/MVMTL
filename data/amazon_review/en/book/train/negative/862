real world mystery made tedious so much could have been done with this story , but was not . while this book shines at descriptions of political events , it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need , and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time , it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience . i hope woodward and bernstein wrote better newspaper stories , because while i was compelled to read the content of this book , it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive , aimless description . not sure i 'd recommend this to anyone , no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a `` classic .
