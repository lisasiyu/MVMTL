do n't waste your time i very much looked forward to the ending of this book not to see what would happen but so that i could be done with it and move on to a different book ! i found this book pointless . after reading 482 pages , i ca n't even think of two adjectives to describe sally and clare . moody does such a poor job of character development that i do n't feel like i know all that much about these two women . i did not like the main characters and i did n't feel as though they had much of a real friendship at all . the book is way too long , the plot is unbelievable , the characters are unlikable , and the writing style is annoying
