obviously , not his best this novel won the pulitzer prize in 1926 ( for whatever reason ) which the author refused to accept ( maybe he agreed with some of the reviews ) . the author later won the nobel prize in literature in 1930 . the novel is about a fictional person growing up in a fictional state , going to a fictional university , etc . i may get jumped on by some people for saying so , but personally i found the story dull and tedious ( a good cure for insomnia ) . it does not compare with other prize winning novels which i have read that were written during the same era ( pearl buck 's `` the good earth , '' booth tarkington 's `` the magnificent ambersons , '' etc. ) . i suppose this is one of those novels that you must read if you are a literature student , but i would not recommend it to anyone else . if you have an interest in the author , i would suggest trying one of his other novels
