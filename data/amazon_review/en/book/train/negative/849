vampire christopher christopher byron 's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded , pathologically envious little weasle of a man , who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture . unless you 're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful , brilliant , talented women because the light from great women 's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life , avoid this book . byron is simply a mean little vampire , trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of martha . shame on john wiley & amp ; sons for publishing this book
