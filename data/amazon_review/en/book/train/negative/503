flashy book with little actual theoretical/critical content i would like to think of myself as someone who is fairly well informed of the ( short ) history and theory of video art . as such , i will say this book is a very basic , sort of bland overview of the langauge of video . it 's very well put together in terms of it being flashy and `` hip '' ; all the stills are well printed and all the big , `` in-vogue '' art star names are included ( but where are people like haron faroqi ? or did he just shoot on film and thus not make the hipster cut ? ) with that said , there is little to no actual critical content in the writing . it introduces concepts in a very simple way , and does n't actually end up saying much other than varying degrees of further artist canonization . i do n't know maybe i am just too picky and also semi-brainwashed by more rigorous academic books on the topic , but i actually stopped reading the book because it was so boring . if you 're looking for a slick coffee table book with which to impress your friends , one that will let them know that you too have joined that cool club called `` connoisseurship of video art '' and a book that they will tend to thumb through just to look at `` all the pretty pictures '' ( which i find hilariously absurd- a book of still images taken from video ) , then this book is for you . if you 're looking for anything deeper than that , i would look elsewhere to titles like `` illuminating video : an essential guide to video art '' by david ross , doug hall , sally jo fifer , and david bolt .
