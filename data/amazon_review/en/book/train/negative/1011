bit off more than he could chew i am a great fan of saylor 's historical novels , but was very disappointed by this one . his skill has always been in creating completely believable environments , down to the smallest details , and placing his stories within those frameworks . but the vast scope of this novel ( ? ) makes that kind of meticulous detail impossible . everything , including the prose , in this book seems somehow pale and uninspired -- a writer biting off more than he can chew , or , to vary the image , spreading himself way too thin . the book reminds me of james michener 's old pot-boiler , `` the source . '' saylor at his best is one-hundred times the writer michener was , but i enjoyed michener 's book more than saylor 's , which i simply could not finish . nothing about it engaged me
