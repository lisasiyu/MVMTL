the other side of silence ... i have read this book , mr . moon 's & quot ; divide and quit & quot ; , mr. khosla 's work , & quot ; stern reckoning & quot ; amongst others on the subject of the partition . ms. butalia 's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy , that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one 's thoughts and mindset . almost a diatribe , if i may . i will agree with what john_galt_who has written . i think he has hit the nail on the head . i did not consider this book worth either the money or the time
