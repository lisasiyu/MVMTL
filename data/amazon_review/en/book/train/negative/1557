witten well but narrow in view , a self catharthis . this book will be a great disappointment to many stroke survivors and their relatives , as it was to me , a survivor . it tells the story of one man in england , with moments that make you think there is a similarity , only to be disappointed . the only hope for the book is the wife 's diary , and her feelings from the event through the treatment . but even then there is the feeling that her diary in censored , knowing that it would be published . the author does direct the reader to some other good books , and gives us a happy ending . the book does teach us that life goes on , even if you have a stroke , but stroke suvivors already know that fact
