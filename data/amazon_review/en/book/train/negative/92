alex rider series jumps the shark . . . some of the other alex rider books may have been a little predictable , but ark angel is by far the worst book in the series . as if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head is n't bad enough , this book really `` jumps the shark '' , not only does anthony horowitz yet again use the `` corrupt rich guy '' plot ( this may have something to do with his childhood . . . ) , but at the end of the book alex gets launched into space . save your $ 15 and buy maximum ride by james patterson or a scott westerfeld book instead
