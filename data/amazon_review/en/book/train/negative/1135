save your money and just write . i like readable prose . this is more like poetry with meaning that must be disciphered or intuited . i am disappointed and am sending the book back . i bought it on the basis of the first reviewer but it did n't impress me as much . i think it would be better to write rather than read more esoteric writing about writing . i would pass on this one
