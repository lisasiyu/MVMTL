wish i had known ... i do n't care how great this book would have turned out to be if i had finished it . within the first 30 pages , stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she 's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old ; and her grandpa plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal 's pain and suffering . if i had known about the distasteful elements in this book , i would never have purchased it
