this book made me fall asleep ! after reading `` why do men have nipples '' and loving it , i had high hopes for book number two . i really enjoyed all the chapters in book 1 , excluding the dialogue between the authors . i found it boring and irrelevant to the book itself . i skipped those sections . the chapter topics were written humorously but gave factual information . very fun and interesting ! this book , was boring . the chapter topics are not nearly as interesting as the first book 's . once again there is the annoying dialogue ( which i skipped ) . there was virtually no humor in this book . i felt like the authors scraped the barrel to come up with topics this time around . i was very disappointed in this book . i read it in a couple hours . zzzzz . guess these authors are good for just one time
