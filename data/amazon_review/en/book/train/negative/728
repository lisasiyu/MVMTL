iteration reiteration back and forth and back and forth . im happy . im sad . happy . sad . love him . dont love him . love him . dont blah . blah blah . we 're poor . we 're not poor . we 're poor . a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas . malamud 's writing style is easy to slip into , and the story is addictive yet annoying ( any pulp novel can be addictive ) . spoiler he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it 's ok ! ( no , do n't try to sell me any of that oh the author 's not giving this his approval , no no no . when there is nothing to contradict something , it 's the same as saying it 's ok. the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad . in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me . )
