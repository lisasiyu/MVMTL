overrated book by overrated genius this book is highly overrated . i am sure i will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing . i enjoy joyce , and many avant garde writers . stein has an ego as big as a house . witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the autobiography of alice b. toklas . the literary equivalent of picasso she is not . the book is slow and boring , filled with failed , in my opinion , rhetorical tricks . if you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers , joyce being the best . jack kerouac is a newer author who is great also . i found it difficult to finish this book . it did not keep my attention . i basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent . it would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius .
