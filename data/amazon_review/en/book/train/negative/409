for advanced only this book is attractively laid out and demonstrates ( briefly ) some techniques for people who have the knowledge to use them . i do n't have it unfortunately . the authors say that knowing photoshop would be `` helpful '' ; i suspect it 's required in order to do the digital printing described here . they also recommend a more basic text on digital printing to understand this book , and that kind of knowledge also appears to be required . that and a big printer ! if i were qualified to use the information , i would probably give it 4 or 5 stars .
