trite , boring & disingenuous while i enjoy greenberg 's radio show , i was extremely disappointed in this book . throughout the book , greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio . unfortunately , unlike on the radio , when mike golic is always available to slap some sense into greenberg , this book is purely 100 % greenberg . i am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives , yet try to act like they have `` struggled '' in life . greenberg has had to `` struggle '' thru a cushy upbringing , going to exclusive schools such as northwestern and eventually landing his gig at espn . for those of you in the chicago area , i hope that you caught debra pickett 's article on greenberg in the chicago sun-times . while greenberg professes to be a family man , the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic , himself , while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool . keeping with his privileged existence , the pool was located at the east bank club in chicago , yet another privileged club to which greenberg belongs . i should receive a refund for slopping thru this `` book . '' hopefully , this review will prevent other people from making the mistake i did . espn should fire this wimpy `` meterosexual '' for writing this book .
