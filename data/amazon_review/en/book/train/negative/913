another not very exciting lt. bak story ... i keep trying but can not get interested in the stories by this author . they seem to drag out with her style of `` he said/she said '' writing with nothing exciting , except perhaps one part in this book . the story begins as the famous lt. bak is asked by his commander thuty to investigate the disappearance of an explorer named minnakht . his guide , senna tells bak of the disappearance and attraction to turquoise mines near the sea . the land is hostile and murder and death come as lt. bak questions each man over and over . the ending was not exciting or unexpected . lt. bak 's constant referrals to the donkeys ( we know how he is sympathetic to animals , this big strong medjay ! ! i had to make myself sit and finish it .
