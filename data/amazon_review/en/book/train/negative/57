thin characterization i agree with one the comments posted below . the main problem with this book is mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it 's impossible to find any depth in him . over the course of the book he does n't change , he 's unsympathetic , and by the time we 've reached page 500 , we do n't know anything more about him than we did on page 10 . i found myself dying to get to the end of this book , just so i could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters . another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way . overall , i thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time
