an idiotic or deliberately misleading book - take your pick i read this book in order to see if it would change my opinion about the status of social security . it does not . in fact , it glosses over the key , overriding issue : that the so-called `` social security trust fund '' does not in fact exist . the claim that huge surpluses are being mounted is meaningless when all that really exists is an iou that the government writes to itself . the book spends all of one paragraph ( see page 28 ) on this critical issue , suggesting that the reader imagine that the fund is invested in private stocks and bonds , rather than government bonds , and concluding , `` it is difficult to see why the composition of the trust fund 's portfolio should make any difference . '' i just about threw the book across the room at that point ! in other words , the authors see no difference between a fund backed by real assets that can simply be sold and a fund that will require raising taxes or additional borrowing on an enormous scale
