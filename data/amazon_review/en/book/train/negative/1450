complete and utter garbage nancy helps mr. drew with his case concerning a rare bird farm that is scheduled to be torn down to make way for a high-rise apartment building . the owners of the farm are being frightened with jinx signs and other symbols of bad luck . ooooooh ! that 's so scary . yawwwwwwn . this book is absolutely horrible . the writing is terrible , the action is missing and there really is n't any mystery . it 's not like nancy is trying to find something or even capture a gang of unknown criminals . when you start the book you know that the people building the high-rise are the bad people . lots of suspense there . this book features nancy at her worst as she stoops so low as to use little children to get what she wants . this is an awful book that does n't even deserve a 1 star rating
