cynosure scallions on the mountain look downwards ( upon ? ) the zebus & sevens really tried to like this book . premise was grand ; story bobbed and weaved ; conclusion was flimsy . discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient . crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow . i dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak ; they do n't come across to the reader as likeable
