she should have stayed home ! i wish i had read these reviews before i bought the book . i would have saved myself $ 26.00 . as an american who has traveled and now lives in europe part of the year i was continually appalled at how she maligned other travelers . she writes of being invited to be a guest speaker on a cruise ship and insults in print all of the other passengers . she had a free trip while others paid , but she ridiculed everyone . i was totally horrified of the things that she said about her former father-in-law . those statements had no relevance to the book and they do not belong in public print . this man is the grandfather of her daughter . i am astounded at how she thrashed him publicly . her book consisted mainly of telling the reader what town she was in , what was wrong with it and the rest of the chapter boring us with what books she was reading and quoting other authors , and relaying in detail every morsel that her and her husband ate . i have visited and even lived in several of the towns she wrote about . of the ones i have not been to unfortunately , nothing she wrote made me want to visit them . i am an avid reader of travel books and essays . i will never again read anything by frances mayes .
