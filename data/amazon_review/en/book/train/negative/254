not anywhere near as good as the movie . i realize that by writing this review i 'll probably have a fatwa issued against me by the comic book fan community , but this graphic novel was a major disappointment . i came to it because i liked the movie so much . i found it to be misogynistic and tedious to read ( entire paragraphs of text repeated , as if the writer could n't think of enough to fill out his story ) . the artwork was ugly . the plot lines were sometimes hard to swallow , characters ' motivations not believable . it was the spark of a great idea that the movie producer ( s ) turned into something excellent
