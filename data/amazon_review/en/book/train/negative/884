sad and strange . i so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book . i read it recently for a book club selection , and let me tell you , if i did n't have to read it , i would have put it down after the first twenty pages , and never picked it up again . i found it to be dark , depraved , disgusting , and depressing ! an examination of love in all it forms ? hardly ! these characters were just plain goofy . i finally figured it out towards the end of the book , these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually . they were looking to other humans to provide them with true love , and that is just barking up the wrong tree . i am giving it one star only for the rich use of language
