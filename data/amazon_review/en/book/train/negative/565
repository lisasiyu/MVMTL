lame ok , mr. koontz , could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god 's existence . this lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment . leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again . your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival ... now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs . what has happened to you , mr. koontz ? are you losing your mind ? have fun at church ... and do n't forget to donate another $ 1,000 to president bush . i refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so . that seems to be around the time that you became a kook
