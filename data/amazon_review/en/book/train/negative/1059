in country in country , how can i describe this book ? in four words crappy piece of garbage ; am so unfortunably forced to read this literature for school , and i 've got too say , to give it two thumbs up you 'll have to read it 8 times . i agree this book could be a very good book if they stood with the plot in part 1 , but tom , sam , and lonnies life story just is n't interesting . look at their names , there too basic . too tell you the truth kentucky is boring , the books boring , and the author is boring . you have to drink coffee to read this book ; the real downside is that the coffee will end up costing more than the book . my advise to all you readers is to jack the book from barnes and noble , borders or photo copy it , save the money for the coffee because your gon na need it
