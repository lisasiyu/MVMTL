not worth the paper printed on we are traveling the us for almost a year and have purchased the east as well as the west edition before we started . besides the fact , that we found only a few nice spots described in those books so far , our comments are as follows : 1 . the contents of both editions are outdated - certain camgrounds do simply not exist any more for years ! ! 2 . the directions are awful if not wrong 3 . we spent more diesel on finding the described campgrounds than we saved not to mention the hazzle , driving around in circles 4 . lots of directions seem to be copied from other books we have and are as wrong as they are in those 5 . campgrounds indicated in the maps by numbers ( icons ) are not part of the book anymore 6 . the icons in the maps are close to impossible to read ( use a magnifier ) overall we can absolutely not recommend those books to anybody
