what happened to tim curry ? my daughter and i had listened to the first two audio books , `` the bad beginning '' and `` the reptile room '' , both narrated by tim curry , so we were very disappointed by `` the wide room . '' tim curry was a fabulous narrator , why did they not continue to use him ? his voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it , and as an actor he really brought the book to life . often , the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with lemony snicket . his whiney , lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction . curry 's fabulous , velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story . lemony snicket narrating his own story is truly an `` unfortunate event !
