the missing element an excellent and important story that needs to be told over and over again . but for those of us who use non-fiction books such as this for research as well , this book lacks a crucial element -- an index . i could not recommend this book to someone researching information on the holocaust because there is no way for someone to retrieve important information without laboriously searching page by page through the book . when will publishers learn what researchers and librarians know , a non-fiction book without an index is not complete
