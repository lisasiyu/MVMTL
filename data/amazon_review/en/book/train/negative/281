not a handbook for parents this is a very comprehensive book about the general subject of raising bilingual children , based on a number of case studies . i am sure that therefore it would be of great use to anyone studying a linguistic subject in this realm . however as a handbook for parents who want to raise a bilingual child it hardly offers any advise . i have a different native tongue than my wife , who 's native language is english . living in an english speaking country i would like my daughter to learn my ( foreign ) native language too . what i was looking for is a book with tips and ideas , such as word games , books , etc . to bring a second language playfully and naturally into a toddler 's life . if you are looking for such a book too , this is not the one . although the book may be good for a linguistics student i have to give it a low rating because of its misleading title
