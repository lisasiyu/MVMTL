a struggle to finish if this had been the first crais book i 'd read i would n't have read any others which would have been a pity as all his previous books ( except the forgotten man ) were excellent . the two-minute rule ( note the use of the grammatically correct hyphen ) has two main characters , holman and pollard , who are made of cardboard and are not in the least bit interesting . the plot was okay but the end was silly . i was bored throughout most of the book and could n't wait for it to finish . if you want good crais then read demolition angel , hostage or la requiem and do n't read this one .
