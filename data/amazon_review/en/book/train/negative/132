it crashes on lap 2 i 'm a fan of janet evanovich and her stephanie plum series , i think it 's laugh out loud funny . i did n't care for this story at all , it seemed sloppily constructed and i agree with other reviewers , lacked a story line or believable characters . i left off a few chapters into it , there was no point in finishing .
