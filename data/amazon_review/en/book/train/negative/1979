remember this is the `` old '' version ... having not seen the orginal rudolph tv show in a very long time i forgot what the story line was ... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child . there are a couple of scary illustrations in this book . my 3 year old was in love with the rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with rudolph again because he said he `` did n't like the scary snowman '' . yes , i know it 's a classic , but be warned
