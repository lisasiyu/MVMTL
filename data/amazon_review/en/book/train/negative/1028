the awfull manga continues ... the awfull book based on the game continues with a second book . i thought the first volume was rushed but this one takes the cake . i am now confused on what is going on , the story is even more rushed , there are many typos , and the story is not really connected to the plot . this book is more of a fan fiction than based on the game
