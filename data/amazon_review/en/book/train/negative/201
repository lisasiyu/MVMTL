great concepts that go nowhere . i zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down . unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that . the main character just goes on a big , boring sight seeing tour . it reminded me of that show on the travel channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design . there is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it 's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings i 've ever read . the book just stops . not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel . it 's a shame because grimsley had some great concepts to work with . in my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both , but grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the sf concepts instead of minutiae . once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the giant freakin ' portal between two worlds -- but enough about that . gee , what a lovely sofa..
