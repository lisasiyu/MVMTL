missed the mark i am a nevada barr fan and was unfortunately disappointed with `` high country . '' the story takes place in a restaurant ( boring ) . the characters were dull and i kept getting them confused . anna 's constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome . i also missed anna 's sister , molly , who is only mentioned a few times in the book . sorry , but i really ca n't recommend this book as a good read . if you want to get a feel for a real anna pigeon adventure , pick up `` track of the cat '' or `` liberty falling .
