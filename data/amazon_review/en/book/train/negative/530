do n't bother ! it 's too bad that clive cussler changed collaborators on his `` oregon files '' series . this was terrible ! i could n't even finish it . i read a lot in all different genres so i feel that i 'm a little qualified to comment on a book i have read . it dragged , some of the characters were changed and even though i know you have suspend disbelief , i could n't keep my eyes open . golden buddha and sacred stone were much better
