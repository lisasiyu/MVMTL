stereotype upon stereotype we are reading this book for our book group . i 'm not sure if it made me uncomfortable because the perspective was so accurate or if it was because it never went beyond the stereotypes that i already have . i did n't like one character in the book . even the dogs and the kid were annoying . while that may have been the result of good writing , the end product was that i was left feeling nothing but `` ick . '' the characters seemed one dimensional even though a large amount of time was spent detailing their thoughts and opinions . i never understood the `` why 's '' behind any of their actions , just their histories . perhaps i was too slow to draw the conclusion . i felt like a big , over consumerized , ungrateful loser . if that 's your thing , you may love the book .
