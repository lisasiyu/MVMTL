a mediocre book at best . i ca n't compare learn to program with c++ to any other c++ books , because this is the only one i have read so far . all in all , unfortunately , the book has turned out to be a failure . i simply did n't get out of the book what i wanted : an elementary introduction to the language . at times , it seemed the author was using phrases that he had never used before , as if he had explained them before at some point . bizarre , yes . he made the assumption that some of his terminology was either very simple to pick up on , or was already covered . it was n't simple or already covered . also , perhaps equally bothersome , the author talks too much about the students in his fictitous class . make note that there actually no classroom with the students he is always talking about . what is probably most bothersome is that he often repeats the same things over such as `` i waited to see if anyone else had a question . '' he is the one writing the book , of course he knows if one of his characters is going to ask a question or not ! remarkable . the interaction between him and his students may upset some people just because there are no actual students . as far as the book being easy to read , well , the introduction is , but you may get lost after that . i did . it is possible that c++ is to blame , or may be it is how the author presents the language
