speculative fiction disguised as essay what trash ! what a paranoid book ! a true work of tendentious and speculative fiction disguised as an essay . no wonder that amazon stands ready to sell this book for $ 0.35 ! even then , it 's a quarter and a half wasted . no wonder also that warmongers paul wolfowitz and richard perle gave it a note of thanks . it reads like their own propaganda in their conspiracy to take over american foreign policy and steer it to israel 's favor . but the mylroie-wolfowitz-perle cabal did succeed in having the u.s. attack iraq . this only shows the tremendous importance of propaganda and the strength of the pro-israel lobby . nazi joseph goebbels , hitler 's minister of propaganda , would be proud of laurie mylroie , since he once said : `` if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it , people will eventually come to believe it .
