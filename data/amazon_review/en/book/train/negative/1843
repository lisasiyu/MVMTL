why was this book written ? i finally found the book that should never have been written . the book was given to me , so i tried to read it . why would anyone waste their time comparing tom clancy 's novel hero against real life presidents and presidental polices ? i have concluded that the author must be jealous of clancy 's success and thought he could make a little money writing a book comparing a fictitious character virsus real presidental policy . this book really deserved a minus star
