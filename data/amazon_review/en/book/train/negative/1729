obviously yancey is a pop psychologist who has no respect for the bible mr. yancey has no respect for the teaching of the bible . god is always there when it hurts . in fact , god allows hurt . look at book of job . god allowed satan to kill job 's children ( ! ! ! ) and tempt his wife away from job and give job a horrible disease . god was always there . in fact , god was a part of the plan to cause job to suffer . why ? on a whim . satan said that job would lose faith if disaster struck him , so god said , `` okay , give it your best shot ! '' sometimes , god sends disasters into your home for a whim , for a wager with satan . this is the lesson from the book of job . sometimes , god himself brings pain and death because christians refuse to uphold the interests of the kingdom of christ . look at the book of jeremiah . it was god who chose to kill israelites , destroy the jerusalem temple . in fact , jeremiah specifically states that king nebuchadnezzar of babylon , who was not a believer , was anointed by god to bring destruction . it 's like god anointing bin laden to destroy america . that would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation . the bible is clear that god chose king nebuchadnezzar to destroy the jerusalem temple and kill israelites . and anyone who opposed king nebuchadnezzar opposed god himself . how does this apply to bin laden . this is how seriously god takes desecration of his house , the christian church . god will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy america if america desecrates god 's houses . and opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing god himself . mr. yancey should think seriously about what god teaches about suffering . god gives suffering when believers desecrate his house . god sends death and destruction when christians refuse to uphold the interst of christ . this is an important lesson for america to learn
