bad book from a mad communist here in brazil , about ten years ago , i tried to read this bad book , but i never finished it.i tried to read , one book printed in argentina , wrote in spanish.this book is bad about even guerrilla warfare . in fact , never any of the tatics describe in this book gave victory to any army or revolution.the sucess in cuba , came not from victory in battle.in fact , never happened a single battle in cuban revolution.it came from the cowardy of batista and his mafia 's government . ever when an army or even mercenaries tried to defeat che guevara , they got it , very fast and whith no dificulties.this happened in congo , to exemple.finally , in bolivia , who was n't and never was a military power , che was ridiculous at guerrilla.even so , che guevara was easily defeated in bolivia , and murdered soon after surrendered in 1967 . in fact , any guerrilla in this world got any military victory , using guevara 's tatics and theories . many parts of latin america had communists taking power , but in any of then using guerrilla warfare . the ever used gramsci 's theories and books to take the power . brazil is an exemple.our communists tried some guerrillas , using cuba 's money and support between 1960 and 1974.all of then were easily and fast defeated . after all , our left has total control of this coutry , but from press , scools , tvs , etc . control . as antonio gramsci wrote in 1930 's italy , when the left controls the intelectuals , the media , the school sistem , all society is put under left 's control without a single shot . this happened in brazil , argentina , bolivia , venezuela , etc
