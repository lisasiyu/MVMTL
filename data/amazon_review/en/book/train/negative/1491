is this really italy ? i do n't know if i was more disappointed or angered at this little insignificant but dangerous book . the contents has very little to do with what children , who travel to italy , will ever encounter . what i find it does is continue the negative strereotyping of the italians . really ! no one stomps on grapes and a child who will visit a farm in italy will hardly see such outdated stereotypical occurrences . can food be the only thing one would like of italy ? of course , since the book failed to explain what other things of wonder a child might see . i bought this for my grandchildren , as sadly there are very few book on italy with some italian words . i returned the book because i would never introduce italy to my grandchildren this way . a very expensive book that perpatuates outdated images . poor job .
