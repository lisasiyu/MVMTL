i am glad i am not the only one who thought this was horrible . absolutely one of the worst books of all time . it took at minimum sixty pages to realize the heifer was missing and then it was downhill from there . i had such high hopes for this book , but it is not worth your time , so do n't bother . i was mentally ticking off all bayous convenient to nola so at least half of the characters could be dumped . i will give the author another chance , but if her main character is as snotty in the rest of the books , forget it . that goes for the rest of the characters .
