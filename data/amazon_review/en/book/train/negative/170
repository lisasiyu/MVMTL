knew it was bad after three pages i 'm sorry , but i expect more out of a book . beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric . after reading beautiful books such as cold mountain and brideshead revisited , to mention just two , i found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that i knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that would n't be worth the read . at page four i was fed up with the author 's style and slammed the book shut
