not his best work as a fan of frederick buechner , i found this volume in our church library and secured it anticipating a summer weekend of ecstasy , reading this book on the back porch while sipping lemonade . i found it disappointing , as he focuses on his collection of buechner family memoribilia . as hard as he tries to universalize it , making it accessible to all of us , for me , it just did n't work . and it reads like a review of one 's summer family reunion . sorry . read his other stuff . it 's great !
