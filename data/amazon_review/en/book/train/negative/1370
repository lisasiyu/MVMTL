for fishing fanatics only stienstra seems to think people only go camping to go fishing -- it 's clearly the reason he goes . a campsite could be a pit , but if there 's trout nearby he gives it a high rating . he never lets you know if the water is swimmable ( i.e . above 55 degress ) -- something people in northern california need to know in the summertime . he also gives something a high rating if the area it is in is nice even if the campsites are horrible . i 've been disappointed many times using his book , yet there is no real competition for his book as it 's the only really comprehensive one on the market . i wish someone else would tackle ( no fishing pun intended there tom ) this subject
