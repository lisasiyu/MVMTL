accidental fabrication i have n't read mr. crawford/s book but i have read all 126 reviews . based on the reviews , not one soldier that served in iraq gave the book a positive review . that says those that know what serving in iraq is like find the author something of a fraud . it was pointed out that mr. crawford previously served in the regular active-duty army and therefore he should know what service in the national guard is all about , including being recalled to active duty in a time of war . you can not over look this point . therefore , the rest of mr. crawford/s claims must be suspect if he misrepresents being an accidental soldier . drugs . you do n't do drugs in a combat zone . i served in vietnam and know that drugs and war do not mix very well . i suspect that the people who praise this book have an anti-iraq war bias .
