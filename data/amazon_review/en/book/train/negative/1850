triumph of big business marketing reagan began his acting career reading cue-cards in the service of general electric during his stint at the `` ge playhouse . '' reagan 's move to the white house had him doing much the same , reading cue-cards written for him by big business , including ge , a weapons and energy conglomerate that owns nbc . if people want to get a good feel for the reagan administration , i 'd recommend the books of michael parenti , who documents the legacy of dirty wars in latin america and the global class war that is turning our planet into a dystopia of haves and have-nots . globalized `` reaganomics '' ( aka , neoliberalism ) is creating a planet of slums and prisons , war and ecocide . the parts of government that served the general public are being shredded , while the entitlement programs of war profiteers and various robber barrons create record profits . it 's interesting to see the reverence kim jong reagan receives ; but whether people like him or not is immaterial , he was n't in charge of the country . rather , very rich and powerful corporate executives and an army of lawyers and lobbyists entrenched themselves during the reagan administration . this corporate coup is something that many presidents have warned us about , including president martin van buren who said , `` i am more than ever convinced of the dangers to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion - the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government - would be exposed by any further increase in the already overgrown influence of corporate authorities . '' if people can break-away from the reagan illusion , and want to learn about real power in this country , i 'd recommend the dvd `` the corporation , '' and the books and radio show of thom hartmann .
