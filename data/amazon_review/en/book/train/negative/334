total bull ! ! estrich is far from unbiased and makes an attempt to come off as such . she 's in the hip pocket of the liberals and is exactaly what her book claims coulter and her fans are . a friend forced me to reed this claiming it would forever change my views . quite the opposite . ann coulter wrote her book standing up for conservatives and christians since people like estrich is out there trying to say the liberal way a good person would think . everything else is wrong . she now comes out with phony outrage and tries to claim that the conservatives are the ones who have been attacking . fact is bill clinton did do monumentally fould and dangerous things to this country . when clinton was in office estrich defended everything he did . we had 8 terrorist attacks under clinton and she felt it was appauling to speek so negatively about a seeted president . what a double standard . now with this book she shows phoney moral outrage and copies coulter trying to reverse the flow . if you can , borrow this book , do n't waste your money . reed it if you plan to argue with someone though . it is full of flawed logic and total bull . it will make your arguing easy . libs hate facts
