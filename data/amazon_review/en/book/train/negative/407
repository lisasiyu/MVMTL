do n't fail to read this if you 're new to earth in today 's world , various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism . these forms of parochialism may be ethnic , `` cultural , '' religious , nationalistic , etc. , depending on where you look . on one hand , ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups ; on the other hand , multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace . example : the turks and the armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ( `` jihad '' is barber 's label for this ) ; yet they see the same pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local pepsi bottling plants ( `` mcworld '' is barber 's label for this ) . that 's the book . this might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious . outside of that , it would take an observer from another planet to find this book 's insights novel or pointed . if you 're new to planet earth , by all means pick up a copy . it will catch you up on a few useful truisms . as others have pointed out , the `` terrorism 's challenge to democracy '' subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11 , but does n't accurately reflect the book 's content . `` jihad '' is deployed as a synecdoche in this book ; muslim extremism is just one of the book 's many examples of parochialism
