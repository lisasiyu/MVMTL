fuzzy-bunny liberalism breaks rank with reality although i agree with several of mr. stamper 's recommendations ( legalizing prostitution , decriminalizing drugs ) , many of his assertions are straight out of the `` i-hate-america '' handbook . all white , male cops -and even many black ones - are racsist , homophobic , women-hating thugs . what we need is a kinder , gentler way of policing . mr. stamper had a brief career as a police officer before his real career of supervisory bureacrat began . he `` confesses '' that in his rookie year he was on his way to becoming one of the bad cops before he was set right by a straight-shootin ' da . it was apparently then that his liberal sensitivities kicked in , and soon he was a supervisor ( all the better to control the average joe ) . the unfortunate thing about this book is n't the stories he relates , or even his recommendations ( some good , some not so good ) , but the haughty way in which he relates it . conservatives , republicans - bad ! liberals , democrats - good ! ( except for unions - bad ! ) if this book were written with respect not only for the majority of rank and file cops , but for the other half of americans that mr. stamper obviously disdains , it may have been worth the money . as it is , if you are to the right of hillary , take a pass on this one
