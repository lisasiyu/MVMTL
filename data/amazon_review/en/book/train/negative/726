it would be funny if it were n't so sad probably the most ( although certainly not the only ) ludicrous part of this book is the entry on caroline higgins , a professor at earlham college . horowitz objects to higgins because she teaches a course on peace activism -- a course taken by students in the peace and global studies program , at a quaker college . it seems odd , to say the least , for a supposed champion of religious freedom to object to people at a quaker school voluntarily enrolling in classes devoted to a central quaker value . that horowitz resorted to including such a weak objection , and one involving such a tiny private college , shows that he really must have been stretching to get his list to 101
