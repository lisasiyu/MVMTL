blair brown is wonderful i listened to the unabridged version on tape . i enjoy audio books because i 'm able to work at the same time ( i paint ) . so i get to feed my desire for great fiction , and get my work done at the same time . blair brown did an incredible job as a narrator . she was able to create a unique `` voice '' for each character in the story , making it easy for the reader to keep track of all of the characters from the get go . however , by the time i got to the end of the tape , i was glad that i at least had painted those six hours instead of wasting my time reading this novel ! i was so disappointed at the end , and found myself really irritated by the main character about three quarters of the way into the story . from the beginning of the story , i was irritated by the character 's daughters too . also , i was irritated that nothing outwardly seemed to change in rebecca 's life . ok , she had an arc , but it was all in her head . i found it very unfullfilling . if i had n't been passively listening to the story , while doing something else , i probably would n't have finished the novel
