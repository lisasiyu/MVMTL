incomprehensible i tried to find specific conditions in the book - and the procedures to follow for treating them . i could n't even figure out the procedures to follow when reading them - the writing just is n't very clear . if there is any organization to this book , i could n't detect it . the author is very enthusiastic about the material and gives lots of her experiences with her patients . that 's nice , but judicious editing , better organization and clarity is what this book needs .
