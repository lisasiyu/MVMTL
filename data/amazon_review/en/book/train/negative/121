not the best choice there is no doubt that sun tzu 's little book on war is an enduring classic , but this little edition is ridiculous . there is a reason it is so cheap . it is all of 96 pages long , including the introduction . if you are going to take the trouble to buy and read sun tzu 's masterpiece , you should at least get a version that explains what sun tzu was really talking about . the best translation is by giles , as is this , but in the original giles translation there is a running commentary , between the lines by giles and several classical chinese scholars , explaining both the context and meaning of the text . it is virtually impossible to really appreciate what sun tzu was talking about without the background that the original giles translation provides . there are several editions of the full giles edition available . any of them are a better choice than this little stripped down version . the best is the special edition that contains two copies of the translation - one stripped down version , like this edition , in addition to the chinese text and the fully annotated version that is twice as long as the unexplained translation . sometimes you really do get what you pay for
