thank god it 's over ! the only reason i finished this book was it was a book club pick - i read a lot and it takes a really bad book for me to quit . this book is just never ending - no plot and a useless read . i ca n't believe so many people are giving it a good review . the constant narrative sounded like a neat way to write but it turned out very exhausting to read . do n't bother
