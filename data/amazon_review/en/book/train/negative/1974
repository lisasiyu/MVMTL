not for me i came to this book wanting to believe , and leaning towards belief , but with plenty of skepticism . this book reinforced my skepticism . it is not intended as a defense of the visions , per se , but friendly non-skeptical interviews with the visionairies , and report of marian messages to the parish at medjugorge , and a smattering of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous events . the interviews with the visionairies were most unsatisfying . the questions were leading and shallow , nothing like the kind of questions i wish i could ask . even worse , the answers were stereotyped , vague , and even evasive . was this a language barrier problem ? an artifact of the interviews being condensed and edited ? an effort to avoid arguments ? perhaps . but i kept comparing in my mind these transcripts with scriptural accounts of conversations with jesus . jesus , despite all language barriers and editing , was always very direct , clear , and substantive , and never shied away from stirring up controversy . jesus also taught us to be on guard against the many false prophets who would surely come . i remain on guard
