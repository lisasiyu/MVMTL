hour game is one of the worst books i 've ever read this is the first ( and last ) book by david baldacci that i 've ever read . he is one of the worst best-selling writers i 've ever read . he writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a tom swifty sentence ( `` we 've got to get out of here , '' said king , menacingly ) . his flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none . the actions of the characters make no sense at all . for example , when michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick , sean king , she says , `` sean , do n't move ! '' instead of `` sean , dive for cover ! ! ! '' bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile
