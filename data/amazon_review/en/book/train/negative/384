disappointment ! this book starts out telling of the sack of rome and grabbing the reader 's attention . it 's all down hill from there . the next third of the book is a long drawn out build up with very little of the book actually dedicated to the finale of the build up . the there is this a bit of drawn out rambling that leads into a sudden ending of the book . it was almost as if the writer either got tired of writing and gave up , or she just did n't know how to end it , so she just ended it . i was highly disappointed .
