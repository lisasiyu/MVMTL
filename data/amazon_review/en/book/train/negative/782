double crossed james patterson created a great character in alex cross and i have faithfully followed the series even though the last several have disapponted me . the plot and character development have become weaker with each book . yet i kept buying the books , even knowing that patterson is more of a franchise that an author . in cross patterson has alex wonder why his daughter wants to read the same book over and over . when i read that line i realized that patterson is making fun of his readers . that 's it for me . i 'll not buy another
