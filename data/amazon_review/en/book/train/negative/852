book tries hard but accomplishes nothing over the years i have had an avid interest in the paranormal . i have read books by numerous authors , and looked forward to this book being one of the best . i found however a book that seemed to wander as though lost , and the author was searching for a direction to go with it but never quite found it . i have taken my law enforcement training and experience , and coupled it with other books on this subject , and found the scientific methods of investigation to be very similar . i am afraid that this book , apart from the poor spelling , and composition would be confusing to novice investigators , and would give them erroneous information , on a subject that is complicated to begin with . i am sure mr.taylor means well , but there are much better books out there for the beginner , or the experienced investigator . the later version is no real improvement eithe
