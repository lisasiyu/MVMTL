poisonous misinformation the most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content , but , based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers , that most people actually believe this drivel . how can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill-informed ? the answer is that we can not . i will not bother to go through a detailed criticism , not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it , but because , in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in , no one would believe it . today , the `` truth '' depends much more on one 's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence .
