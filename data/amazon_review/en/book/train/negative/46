do n't waste your money ... ... you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library . if you want to get an `` inside view '' of the inner workings of wall street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s , then read den of theives - that book is well written and well worth the money ! what turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style . the first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of serendipity . he was simply in the right place at the right time , had virutally no idea how he got there , felt out of place the whole time ( even when he was raking in the big bucks in ny and london ) , and so now he thought he 'd wwrite a book about it . i also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at salomon brothers . he was there , he made a lot of money , good for him - get over it ! i was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has a lot more potential . i might have actually enjoyed it - had i not read den of theives 7 years earlier , and already had some idea of how things took place . but , if you can get it for $ 5 or less ( including shipping ) , and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker 's life is like ( and you have n't also seen the movie wall street ( which covers the same highlights in this book ) ) , then it 's probably worth it . i did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book , relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up ... althought that seemed a little rushed..
