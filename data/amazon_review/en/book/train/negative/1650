trite dialogue , zero description i thought this book was terrible . i do n't understand why people think this author is so amazing ( unless they have really low iq 's ) . yes the subject matter was interesting but the delivery was very poor . i showed it to a friend of mine and she said , `` she writes like she learned to write from watching tv . '' the novel is all dialogue and very little description , which does n't equal up to an interesting read for me . there was little suspense , i was not sympathetic to the main character , and the attempt at romance was a joke . you want some real suspense in a mystery revolving around the legal system ? go read grisham
