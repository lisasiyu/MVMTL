he lost me with the personal attack i personally believe dr. dyson has the best interest of black folk at heart . i really do . however , i think he is misguided and i am not impressed by him . i admit i did not finish the book . once he began his personal attacks on mr. cosby i left it alone . bill said what many of us say in private . period . you can argue that he picked the wrong time and place , but the message is the right one . maybe he did not say it as nicely as he could have , but it is still the truth . at the end of the day there are way too many writers and speakers trying to pass themselves off as leaders . leaders lead , writers write , and speakers talk . the sad thing about it is so many of our people incorrectly accept these people as leaders . there are too many people trying to tell us what to think and not enough showing our people what to do . while dyson beats cosby down personally i ask what should some of these young brothers do to better their situation ? there are basically two kinds of people in this world . you either look for people and things that confirm what you think to be true . or you look for people and things that will reveal the truth rather it confirms what you thought or turns it on its head . at this time our people need the truth , not more pandering .
