koontz was hyped as king 's sole competition for so long ... but i do n't understand why after reading this book . i saw flashes of koontz as a contender with this story , but in the end the book limped along on half-drawn characters and stilted dialogue . koontz came up with a grand slam premise , and it was the strength of the premise that dragged me across the finish line . without that i 'm not so sure i would 've made it . the characters are n't all badly drawn , but none of them really feel complete . the dialogue is at times atrocious , at others simply frigid . as a case in point , i have not forgotten -- nor will i ever forget -- the preposterousness with which one of the characters described the monster in detail as he 's being eaten . i almost took off my running shoes at that point . almost . koontz can write well when he puts his mind to it . but phantoms proves too stiff and underdeveloped to truly showcase his talent . pick up intensity instead
