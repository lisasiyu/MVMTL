tiel tips on this book for some great advice email me at humorgirl86 @ hotmail.com . i have owned a cockatiel for 8 years and have alot of expierience . this book is informative on housing , feeding , breeding and healing . it has great pictures but , it 's not the pictures that make the book it 's the words ! it does n't go into great detail about everything . it hardly has a page on training and that does n't even help if at all . sure it may seem good but once you read it , it really is n't that good at all . i say that you should go to the pet store or book store and actually read the book or scan it to make sure that it has what you want . petsmart and petco are great pet stores that have plenty of books and all the needs for a cockatiel
