save your money brian hinton 's both sides now is a complete disaster . what could have been a promising biography of mitchell is instead a garbled mess . indeed , hinton 's text is relatively void of biographical information . rather , hinton relies on a handfull of interviews published of mitchell 's , and he quotes from them in such large chunks that the reader would be the wiser to check out the interviews from their sources . following a brief , and flawed , biographical section , hinton uses the rest of the text as a forum for his interpretations of mitchell 's work . album by album , song by song , hinton gives his own personal commentary on mitchell 's music so that the text ends up reading like a diary of hinton 's own personal reflections . moreover , hinton 's analysis of mitchell 's songs are sometimes so off-base and confusing that the reader is left wondering how he comes to these conclusions . finally , his constant personal comments in the text make it seen like nothing more than a high school writing assignment
