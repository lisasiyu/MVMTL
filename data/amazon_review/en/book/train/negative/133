a waste of money -- 5 pages of nothing ... . save your money and just make a guide yourself . this & quot ; discussion guide & quot ; has only one title page and then four pages of large font bare basic summary with a small sprinkling of questions . if you think that this is weak , you will go on to realize that the last of the four pages is even half taken up with the publisher 's logo and information . if you hold the print out close to your ear ... you can hear your money being flushed down the drain ! !
