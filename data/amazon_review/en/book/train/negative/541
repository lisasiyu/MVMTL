tell me something i do n't already know this is basically a book of few words , many uninspiring photographs , and a some weak hints here and there that reveal to you the astonishing secret of clutter-free living : just buy a bunch of cute and clever containers to store all your junk ! there is virtually nothing meaty in this thing about how to get organized and stay clutter-free .
