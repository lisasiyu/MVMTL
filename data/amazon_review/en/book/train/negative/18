obsolete this book completely fails to realistically convey the relative risks and profit potential for the average wannabe day trader . im talking about someone with less than a few thousand to play the market . unless you have big bucks and level ii quotes forget day trading unless you are very lucky . in the trading parlance , i wish i had a short position on this book at its current price , and could cover my short at the current used price ! save your money
