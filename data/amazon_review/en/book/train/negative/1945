looking for prolife information will not find it here . i had to use this particular book for a class i was taking . i was hoping for at least a balanced presentation , but i was very disappointed with this book . i found it to have a definite anti-life view . i found that the author minimized the role of morality in the field of bioethics . especially how religion contributes to moral views and how that effects bioethics . i also found that the author tried to present catholic church teachings specifically without even a basic understanding of how the church developed these views
