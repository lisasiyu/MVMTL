are we reading a rough draft ? just in the first few paragraphs alone she makes the same point about the smell of the slave market not being quite as strong because of the cool weather 3 times . it seemed like a redundant effort to fill pages with nonsensical information . if she had a better editor who helped her catch these errors she could concentrate on making an even deeper more rich story which i believe she desperately wants to accomplish . sorry to say i wo n't be reading another of her stories again
