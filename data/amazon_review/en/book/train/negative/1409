the horror of airport book purchases ... i was given this book by a friend with great taste in books , so i eagerly started it . after the first few chapters , i could not wait for it to end . the ultimate horror of this book is reserved for those compelled to finish any book they start . as has been mentioned in other reviews . we get it . the woods are `` scary '' and their presence is pervasive . the characters themselves , despite the author 's intent , are also wooden , and if the reader experiences any fear , it is the fear of being infected by the banality and possible mental retardation of heather price and her insufferable family . the best way to describe the story for me is this : it 's a fairy tale . its simplistic writing style and unsophisticated fear-factor could have very easily been told in 5 or 6 pages , and inserted invisibly into a volume of grimm 's . as such , it would have been a much better tale with at least the healthy moral about the hazards in spending too much time with your crazy aunt . as a novel , it is pure water torture . if the trees ever do revolt , useless wastes of paper such as this piece will most certainly be causative . i asked my friend about it after i finished . he admitted it was a joke ... a book he bought on a flight out to visit me , and in his words `` i was praying my plane would crash after the first 2 chapters . '' indeed
