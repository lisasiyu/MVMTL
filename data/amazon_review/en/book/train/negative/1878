actually , this book is terrible i just picked up the guitar again -- i played guitar briefly , and very badly , years ago -- and was hoping for a quick refresher course and a little more . this book , alas , is just terrible . the organization is illogical and confusing , important topics are given very short shrift while unimportant stuff fills page after page . most of the book could charitably be called filler . the book is terrible as a reference book as well ; useful stuff like scales and chord diagrams are scattered about the book , and many of the diagrams are hard to make sense of . ( he does n't even explain the correct tuning for the guitar until page 170 , in a section on how to play slide guitar -- i had to look it up on the internet . ) i chucked the cd into the trash . for scales , i found `` the ultimate scale book '' to be about a zillion times better .
