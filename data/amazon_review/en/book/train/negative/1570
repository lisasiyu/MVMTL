vague , wordy , confusing , and in need of examples i found that if you want to learn the language of auditing , have another reference handy . often , the discourse goes on and on and on and could really be distilled down into a sentence or two that had a firm and grounded presentation . there were very few examples so it was difficult at best to try to understand the often high-level conceptual frameworks that were constantly being presented . i also noted quite a few editing errors that probably arose from cut-and-pastes that were not carefully reviewed . also , figures and diagrams were reused and were not carefully reviewed either as information was present that did n't apply to the new scenario
