you dont really get your bang for your buck i have to say that i was really dissapointed in this book . i know it says there are 23 stories , so i should haev been better prepared for short stories ... only some of them were only like 5 pages long , and on top of that , they were just plain stupid . i think this was a waste and i know i will not buy any moer books that have large groupings of stories in them . hey , i like a good hot juicy sex scene as much as the next person , but i think i would prefer a little more depth of the story than what you get with this group of stories . some of the stories in here would have you going & quot ; huh ? & quot ; after you read it . what else can you say..
