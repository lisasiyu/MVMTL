not impressed by any means ok , i like to be scared . i like good ol ' traditional scary stuff ! this book was just ( for the most part ) weird ! the tales were weird , the author comments were weird , and most of the stories were pathetic . i mean , some of them were definitely worth the read , but it 's not worth the fifteen bucks this book costs . used , five bucks , maybe , but i would strongly suggest spending your money elsewhere -- i 'll let you know when i run across an anthology worth fifteen bucks , but it is n't this one
