a powerful flop ! the title of the riddle of the sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a british traitor . that 's the gist of the novel . but what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang , garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail . understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal . the writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance . this is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism , if i ever saw on
