massie ... .please , find a new dead horse to beat ! robert massie has spent execptional amounts of time for over 30 years flaying this dead horse about the romanvos . he has all ways been dead wrong with any of his `` findings '' . as any /every one knows , history is a fairy tale , slanted by the winning side . russians are incapable of telling the truth . the british are not known as exceptionally truthful . there are legions of individuals both directly involved and peripherally involved with the `` fate '' of the romanovs , but none will band together and state the facts . too , too ridiculous , with massie acting like moses coming down from the mount . hey , bob , after all , it is only your version of the facts . his `` research '' is sloppy , he relies on dubious sources . he violates all the basic tenets of factual , honest journalism . by all means , avoid any and all books with massie 's name on them . total waste of time , effort , ink , paper and money . he should have quit with `` nicholas & alexandra '' , so long ago
