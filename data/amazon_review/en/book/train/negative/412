ethan walker does not know christ ethan walker 's `` the mystic christ '' does not at all understand or explain the real jesus christ . i 'll return this literature as soon as i get the chance . it 's completely bogus ( with very little truth to it ) i mean this man totally misunderstands the plan for redemption , what real love is meant by christ , and any other reality pertaining to christ . if you want to understand christ , trully , then learn about him from st. francis of assisi , st. john of the cross , st. teresa of avila , st. vincent ferrer , fr . reginald garrigou - lagrange , dom vitalis , henry manning , st. thomas aquinas , sister josepha menendez , . etc ... .these days it 's very popular to twist and distort jesus christ by saying lo here is `` a '' christ and lo there is `` a '' christ . this book lacks in real knowledge of christ . while some of this litarature has good points ( not on christ of course but on buddha and krsna , etc it does ) it really only shows the authers lack of understanding jesus ' real plan and reason for his incarnation . the book should have been called `` the mystic life '' and not `` the mystic christ '' . totally misleading and insulting toward christ ( not `` the '' or `` a '' christ ) ... . if you want to be mislead then read this book . if you want to be lead in the correct path then read `` the way of divine love '' by sister josepha menendez if you really want to know the real jesus christ ( there is no lo here and lo there and there is no word `` the '' and letter `` a '' in christ ) . do not fall for this sort of neuro-linquistic programming ...
