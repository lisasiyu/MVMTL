precious little addition to espionage page after page and line after line , this book is amazing in its power to frustrate even the most gawky-eyed initiate in the world of espionage-reading ! philby says pretty much nothing that will add to our knowledge of his ways and mechanics of operation . he is a fine writer , without doubt , but good writing befreft of content ? he does not wax expansive on his faith - communism ; he does not explain the hows of his first contact with the kgb ; he does not even offer a strand of information on his life in moscow , his marriage , his routine ... aww , come on ... pick it up and read it one three-hour layover at the airport ... then place it in your library so that you have a book ( for the record ) that was written by the spy who outdid 'em all !
