mildly entertaining , completely unrealistic this book was readable and somewhat compelling in that i wanted to know what would happen next . however , the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character 's lives . a ucla professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband ? it reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that does n't require any more time than giving lectures ( with apparently no preparation ) , going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it , and traveling to exotic places to do research . that was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book . i had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it . it was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure
