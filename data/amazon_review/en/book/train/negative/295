before you swallow the hype read all of the reviews ! i totally agree with the couple of reviews where the book was sent back to amazon . some of the reviews are positively glowing and just why is beyond my comprehension , the book offers ( as do most watercolor instruction books ) considerable sound advice about supplies and composition etc etc etc but the pictures suck ! it is difficult for me to believe this is a professional artist ( presuming making a living on this humdrum output . ) she has a vey limited palette mostly autumnal browns and golds and mostly very small ( 8x8 and 12x12 ) pictures that are a hash and rehash of weeds leaves and branches , ,sometimes a watercolor book is so astoundingly beautiful it is worth having just to admire the pics , , , well , , , not this one ! totally ripped off is the feeling given ,
