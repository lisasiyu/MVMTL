a cynic 's bible `` with the dark magicks that fill these pages '' two types of cult could be founded : the cult of kon-stantinos , or a cult of complete cynicism . as someone who cherishes his spiritual and magickal beliefs , i do not know which would be worse . the author 's insincerity is self-evident in every concept , and as usual he urges us to read on like we are about to encounter something earth-shattering ... his tone is always `` prescient '' and always patronizing . the pseudo-goth aspect to kon 's writing is wearing seriously thin now and besides , any serious spiritual seeker will find the trappings insulting . his obsession with `` naughty '' alcohols such as the illegal absinthe is seriously sad . his spiritual perspective is the same : he plays with a safe `` bad boy '' boy image but never has the balls to wrap it in anything but the `` essentially i 'm not so bad '' image . the impression he gives to the intelligent seeker after spiritual inroads is that they do not sensibly exist in a modern and very contrived book such as this . my one star i rate for `` nocturnicon '' comes from the book cover , which is far better than the book deserves , and from the fact that he is quite a good technical writer . i have seen much worse get into print , including with his own publishing house , llewellyn publications . however if i was a cynic about occult arts , i would use this book to demonstrate why . as a reader i get the feeling that kon-stantinos feels the same . he 's looking to sell a concept , any concept . here he happens to have fallen on one of the more questionable sets of references anyway - the necromonicon - and in this case 1+1 = minus 5 . it seems that he is trying to mess us all up with that `` little ****er '' ( he mentions in the intro ) in his head . either that or his misleading of the ( mainly young deluded goth ) public is incidental to his need for some kind of publicity . which makes him a true kon-man .
