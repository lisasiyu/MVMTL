insulting to anyone with intelligence i have to admit , i have forced myself to listen to michael weiner 's abortion of a talkshow more than once.in a way it 's almost humorous , until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously , they view him as a deep political thinker . he is not.he is an ignorant , homophobic , sexist , racist little subhuman troll . an insult to true , honest-to-god old-fashioned american conservatism . william f. buckley jr he ai n't . what this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual . one would find more insightful comments at your state 's mental hospital , or by a survey of several of your town 's homeless population . i ca n't wait for the day when savage , limbaugh , hannity , o'reilly and their counterparts on the left moore , franken , janeane garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve . or even better , we could get nasa to get cracking on building the first solar lander , and have them put these windbags on it . the average iq of the nation would increase , and perhaps we would then be able to listen to real political discourse , instead of a bunch of ignorant , partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another .
