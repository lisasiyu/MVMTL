feels like a dutiful summary first , my background : i am not a mathematician , but an academic with fair knowledge of college math and even some advanced materials . i do greatly enjoy reading books about mathematics and mathematicians . this book is obviously a work of great effort by the author . my difficulty probably came from the work 's ambitious premise : offering mathematical and biographical history of hilbert 's problems . there are simply too many ideas and persons ( some well known , others a bit obscure to lay reader like myself ) to cover in one book . the author dutifully and honestly gives references to his sources . my impression is that the author collected as much material as he could about each problem and solvers , and tried to squeeze the information as compactly as possible into the pages . the result : the narrative is very methodically told - explanation of the problem , some necessary ideas introduced , who the major solvers were , then a short biography of each solver , when and where they were born , who their parents were , where they went to school , who they married and so on ; then another cycle begins . halfway into the book , i began to get bored . i can imagine mathematicians enjoying a quick review of and glimpses into their discipline and heroes , but lay readers much beware . i recommend lay readers to check out a few pages carefully online or at your local library to see whether you like it . i certainly did n't hate it but did not like it as much as i expected
