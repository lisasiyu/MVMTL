really did n't like it . first off , i 'm not a fan of the writing style . it covers so much information and time with little dialogue , or characters for that matter . but that 's just the style . the way the story was presented was what i had a problem with . it seemed like the author had a lot of interesting ideas on what he thought the end times would be like , and he did n't want to write an end-times non-fiction spiritual book , so he just presented it as fiction , but did n't quite know how to do that . characters are introduced simply to experience the asteroid plumetting into the earth . then , they drop off . all of a sudden , near the end , they come back , and now they 're like generals or something , or leading some kind of airstrike during the battle of armaggedon . what ? ! this book is a grid , a blueprint for a certain way it could happen . it is not a story about people , or a story with a plot . it is just a list of events that read on until jesus comes . the only reason i gave it two stars was because it did n't follow the whole rapture-theory at all ( that word is n't in the bible , and even implications of one does n't say when during the tribulation it would be ) . in this story , the christians are here for the whole thing , and everything is n't quite so set and orlderly and expected like the left behind series . it follows the premise that throughout the last century or so , we 've already experienced the seal judgements , and that the asteroid hitting earth is the beginning of a great cataclysm that mankind is about to face . if you want a different take and are n't expecting much of anything else , read this , but not if you want a real story with passion or voice .
