not impressed i have been a huge fan of dean koontz for years , ever since my mom got me to read watchers . but this story is just way too slow . just when i thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride ... .it would slow way down again . i almost put it down halfway through the book , but i kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner . about 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining ... .but i just felt like something was missing most of the time i was reading . i just could n't get into the characters . i would n't recommend this book to any first time dean koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off ... .do n't judge his work by this novel .
