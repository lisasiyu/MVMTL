violent - what were they thinking ? good concept , poor choices . i purchased this book to give as a gift to my nephew . when it arrived , i opened the book to the middle and i could not believe what i was looking at . one of the art scenes is of a battle where a man charging on a horse has been decapitated . blood is spewing from the headless neck , his necklace is falling in one direction , and his separated head ( with a horror/surprise look on his face ) is falling to the ground behind the horse . this is very gruesome , and there is no way i could give this as a gift a child of any age . wondering what could be worse , i turned the page to find another battle scene . one man is being struck to the back of the head with a club/mace and his head is caved by the blow . i am not making this up , the head is split open and details are painted . many others in this same art work lie dead and dieing with arrows in their heads and torsos . i look at the next artwork , and a man is pinning another to the ground while he slices his throat with a knife . why would someone pick these art works ? why would the editors allow them ? i 'm still stunned that this would make it print .
