st. giles beond compare ? please . i have to agree with anna hope 's review . this book was so painfully lame that i gave up on it two-thirds of the way through and stopped wasting my time ... something i very rarely do . but this book , while starting excitingly , soon dwindled into boredom and i realized that i could definitely put it down . i did n't care about the two main characters nor what happened with the storyline . as far as st. giles being beyond compare , try kresley cole . now that 's writing ; her books i hate to put down
