dr ... .. why ? ? ? ? i came upon this book by random chance , and was mislead to believe that this was a piece of true literature . a book ( short story really ) that stumbles towards nothing . if you 're looking for some popcorn reading , sure this might suite you just fine , but avoid like that plague otherwise . i suggest picking up some vonnegut or yates . i hope this review might save at least one of you ! ! ! ps : avoid frustratingly pointless epilogue..
