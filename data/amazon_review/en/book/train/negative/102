i hate stephen hawking why ? because this book says nothing more than what he had already said in a brief history of time . however , i will say that unlike a brief history of time , this one is a really , really big book with lots of colorful pictures so that they can charge an extra 30 dollars . and that he also changed the titles of the chapters . that 's something ... and the pictures were pretty ! believe it or not after i read universe in a nutshell i decided to give good ol ' steve one more shot so i picked up a theory of everything . however , to my surprise , within those pages i did n't find a theory of everything ... but i did find somehting that amazed me more than a theory of everything every could ... inside , i found a brief history of time ! he had fooled me again ! it 's a conspiracy , this man is publishing the same book over & over again with different titles to fool people into buying them . and he 's including illustrations now because he discovered how well worthless pictures sell ! do n't buy into it ! it 's a trick , underneath the new dustjacket , pretty pictures , and new chapter headings , these are same words ! i proclaim myself to be the first to say `` i will not be fooled by mr. hawking again .
