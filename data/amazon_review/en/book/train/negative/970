a disappointment i could n't finish this book and i 'm not sure if the problem is in the writing or in the editing . at times the author seems to take these great leaps based on one or two anecdotes from his life and it is just not convincing . there are some interesting details here and there but for me , it was just too rambling and all over the map .
