very disappointing . i saw the bill moyer 's pbs series on huston smith . i was very impressed . i bought the world 's religions by huston smith and was blown away . fantastic summaries of the 7 great world religions and a chapter on the lesser religions . i 've had the question nagging at the back of my mind for a while , `` does religion really matter ? '' so , when coming across why religion matters i knew i had to read it . i did n't read the whole book . i fell just short of 200 pages before giving up . the book was n't getting to the point . it just kept bashing science and scientism , over and over . this is a dreadful book
