disappointing - nothing new , nothing original this is an example of one of those thousands of guitar books which discusses several subjects in a superficial way and never really nails anything down in a useful way . the author has not put forth a single original idea or even bothered to present the same old stuff in a new and different way . this book is not a guide to the fretboard , it is basic music theory for absolute beginners . if you want rock solid information about the guitar 's fretboard skip this and do what everyone else does : get fretboard logic . the author has released several books under the same title with pretty much the same stuff in each one . this one is a mel bay retread
