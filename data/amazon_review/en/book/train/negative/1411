read the kjv please . this bible is not the true god 's word . it has been changed too much . i believe that the kjv is the true bible . god died for our sins . he shed his blood so that we might have everlasting life - but , only if we belive . this bible is written to make you feel good about yourself . all we are sinners destined for hell and damnation . god was not brought into this world just to make us feel good about ourselves but to make us feel a need to repent from our sin . we can not get to heaven in eternity unless we believe in the lord jesus christ
