an unwieldy translation in a nutshell : do n't waste your money on this version . the original version of this translation dates to just after the turn of the century , but the introduction and further editing by anatol rapaport ( a biologist and a musician , not a political scientist or historian ) , make this a clumsy read at best and downright misleading at worst . rapaport , for being an editor of clausewitz , was not a believer in the trinitarian system ( primordial violence , non-rational actions , and rationality ) - probably not a good choice for a work which owes as much as it does to the first and second trinities ( army , people , and government ) . if this is the only one you can get , then live with it . the first chance you get , get the much clearer , much more straightforward paret/howard translation , which is the one that 's actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it
