diappointing this is certainly an impassioned defence of beauty , and a 'feel-good ' book , but it is so lacking in substance is barely counts as a contribution to the debate . it 's incoherent at many levels , most notably concerning the switch from the accepted idea in part one that beauty is always particular , to the claims in part two that it is a function of certain qualities , especially symmetry . asthetic symmetry promotes ethical justice ? the idea of beauty as enlivening is also too simple . this is not good enough as a theory of the link between aesthetics and ethics . the account of the so called 'political complaints ' against beauty is a set of caricatures . there is also a very weak accounts of matisse , whose nice paintings are regarded by scarry as stand ins for real windows and real palm trees ; some sense of what modernist art has done to the concept of beauty and why is needed here . there are many better books on the topic .
