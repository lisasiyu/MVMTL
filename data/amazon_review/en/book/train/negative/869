her weakest by far i 've read all of nevada barr 's anna pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until i reached hard truth . after writing so many intellligent , suspenseful stories , barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime . murder 's not nasty enough ? how about the murder of children ? still not gruesome enough ? add incest/rape/torture ... you get the picture . ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains , but really , who cares ? the kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal . it 's like bad language in humor -- in general , it 's just a cover for bad writing . in hard truth , barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness , in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable : the charm and intelligence of her main charcter , the well-reasoned defense of nature , the lush descriptions of each story 's setting . i found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable . i give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character ( a recently paralyzed ice climber ) , but otherwise i 'm sorry i spent my time and money on it
