in my trashcan this book is awful . what a disappointment after such great success with theodore roosevelt . i forced myself through half this book straining to distinguish reality from the fiction and fantasy that morris interjects willy-nilly throughout . what a chore , what a bore , what a waste . this went in the trash can rather then the bookshelf to insure no one else might pick it up and waste as much time as i did on it .
