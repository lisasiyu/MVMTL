i have a dream too that one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book . this book is not meant for kids aged 4-8 . it is well beyond what they understand . frankly , i do n't even think a 4 year old can even read this . nice pictures . but unfortunately , i do n't enjoy buying a book for pictures . i can get pictures anywhere . i did n't need to purchase this book to get them . anyway , do n't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures . with regards to the age group . unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her
