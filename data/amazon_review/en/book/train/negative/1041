overrated nonsense living near mccarter theater in princeton my ap english class got to go see a production of this play while it was still being work-shopped for broadway . afterwards , my teacher asked what we all thought , of course first stating that she loved it so that all of the `` favorite '' students knew which opinion to take . they all raised their hands and said they loved it to , however , no one could say why . why not ? because everyone hated it . i was the first to open the flood gate . `` i thought it was ridiculous . it has no real substance to the plot . '' `` that 's because the language is the point '' `` well the language is the worst part . why would poor factory workers speak in absurdly flowery metaphors ? especially ones that stupid ( 'does the bicicle miss the boy ? ' ) ? '' my teacher flipped out at this . `` you do n't understand ! that 's what literature is all about ! metaphors ! '' the woman , asides from being a gigantic b**ch , was merely blinded by what reviews had told her to think and by her crush on jimmy smitts . a month later , the new york times , reviewed the play after its broadway premiere . they said pretty much exactly what i thought . i was going to bring the review into class , but why bother ? the woman already hated me . ps . one earlier reviewer discussed how it was impossible to determine from the production the the daughter was raped . during a q & a afterwards , emily mann stated that they were having problems deciding how to show this . i agree with the reviewer that they clearly did n't come to a good solution
