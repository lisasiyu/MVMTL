terrible textbook i am only partway through my organic chemistry course , but already i know enough about this book to give it a very negative review . it simply does not explain topics well enough . also , the problems at the end of the chapters are simply not difficult enough to prepare you adequately for exams . although i 've never used any other textbook , this one justs seems horrible . i 'm generally an excellent student and can learn from many different types of texbooks , but this one is just horrible . i referred to 'organic chemisty as a second language ' by david r klein for a clear understanding of many topics such as fisher projections , asid base strength , predicting substitution and elimination reactionns , resonance , drawing chair conformations , determining the configuration of a stereocenter , and many other basic concepts which are not explained well in this textbook . if however , you are going to use this book , i would highly reccomend buying the solution manual , it is difficult to use this book without it . the solutions manual ( 4th edition ) repeats each question before giving the answer , so it also a valuable aid to use even without the book itself .
