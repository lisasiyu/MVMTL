a few stars short of a constellation i recently purchased this book and was somewhat disappointed when i sat down to read it . the subtitle is & quot ; games & amp ; puzzles to stimulate your creativity & amp ; imagination & quot ; . actually , there are only some thirty such puzzles and many of them are 'old chestnuts ' . however , my biggest complaint is the lack of accuracy . the very first puzzle ( p. 20 ) has a mistake in it . then in 'mental counting ' ( p. 161 ) , the author claims that the letters o and u are not symmetrical about the vertical axis . as for 'three-dimesional dots ' ( p. 199 ) the text states & quot ; below is a collection of random dots. & quot ; unfortunately , the random dots have been omitted . so much for & quot ; something remarkable & quot ; happening as the author claims . and how 's this for one of the three ( yup , only three ) lateral thinking puzzles ? what common word begins with is , ends with nd , and has la in the middle ? i bet that really stretched your brain , did n't it ? sorry , but mr. wujec 's editor should be fired . these glaring mistakes and omissions have scuttled any enjoyment i may have expected from this book . i suspect the author was motivated by the commercial success of his previous book . he should have waited until he had something of value before publishing this schlock
