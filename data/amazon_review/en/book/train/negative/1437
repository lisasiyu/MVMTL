a hacked version of the classic anthology as a huge fan of the author and the original release of this brilliant short story collection , i am extremely disappointed in the new release . hunt down the original . the new version omits all of zelazny 's forewords and , more damning , it actually omits some of the better stories found in the original collection . silverburg mentions & quot ; horsemen ! & quot ; in the introduction , then the story is strangely absent . this is a travesty
