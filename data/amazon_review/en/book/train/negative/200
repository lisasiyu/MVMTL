i agree with everett -- the audio version is terrible i wish i had followed everett logan 's advice and skipped this cassette . you can tell that the material itself is great , but the narrator is terrible , terrible , terrible . he dumbs down the text . i bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery , but decided to listen to it myself first . i 'm glad i did -- i would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone
