a book with to many numbers and figures i bought this book to learn some interisting new facts that i have not heard about before . well this book did n't do that . most of the stuff in this book i have read in other places and it was written better . like the `` red queen '' by matt ridley & `` why is sex fun '' by jarod diamond . this book relies to heavely on statistical data to come up with anything very interisting . i found myself skipping complete pages and chapters because of the boredom for having to read to many statistics . if you are looking to use this book as a resource to quote statistics about sex then you are in good shape , this book will give you plenty of that . other wise i recomend that you stir clear of this book .
