this is perhaps the weakest book that iles ever written this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good . i 've read all iles ' complicated yet fasinating novels , most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed . but this 24 hours did n't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes ' over 24 minutes , i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again . the other books such as the quiet game , sleep no more , blood memory , dead sleep are all great reading experiences , his first and second ones were just too jewish focused . concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles , although after hurricane katrina , the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right , not as good as what iles described in his novels . all said , this time no cigar for you , poncho
