better than the first one , but ... . this is the second book about a group of four best friends who go their separate ways for a summer , keeping in touch through writing and passing along a shared pair of jeans . the characters in this story were likable . i enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view . i liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times . however , i found much of the story to be utterly predictable . from the moment i started reading , i could tell exactly how tibby 's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the `` cool '' kids would turn out . i also knew what would happen when bee tracked down her grandmother . carmen 's mother 's relationship followed an equally predictable arc . although the characters were good , i found the story lines too dull to really sustain my interest
