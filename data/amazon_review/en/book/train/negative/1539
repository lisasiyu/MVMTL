can not share the same enthusiasm i bought this book a number of years ago for apologetics purposes -- while i would agree with other reviewers that it holds a high view of scripture , and the book definitely represents a lot of research , i think that the approach to symbology used here can be problematic . the entire book is a study of constellations , and how they display the gospel in the stars . while this is an interesting study i think there a oouple of underlying problems with this approach . 1 . constellations and star names are simply assignments that man has assigned to stars . usually pagan cultures in association with their pagan mythology . although this does not completely undermine such a study it does call it into question . 2 . a second more serious problem is the same problem which underlies numerology and other allegorical approaches -- they can often be made to say anything the author even while at the same time appearing scholarly . those looking for apologetics in the cosmos should consider investigating the `` anthropic principle '' which tracks evidence of god 's design of the universe . one such book would be `` show me god '' by fred hereen . in terms of our faith , in my opinion , god 's word itself furnishes a lifetime of study without engaging in speculation of symbols which we really ca n't prove one way or the other .
