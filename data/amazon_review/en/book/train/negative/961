dont waste your kids ' time ! i recently read this book for a elan class @ uga . i thought it was terrible and pointless . the characters lack depth and the theme of the book is not developmentally appropriate for 7th or 8th graders . the book was around 100 pages and leaves the reader wishing he had done something better with his time . my professor scolded me for not wanting to read this book to my future classes . she claimed i was scared to read books to my kids . ( i guess she is refering to the religious implications in the book ) she is absolutely right . i am terrified to read bad books to my students .
