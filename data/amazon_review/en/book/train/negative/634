good book , but do n't listen to the audio version . i have listened to ( and enjoyed ) many books on cd in the past few years . this reader is among the worst that i 've had the displeasure of hearing . the content of this book is great , so do n't get me wrong . however , the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended . he pronounces many character names incorrectly , including carpathia and adbullah . his character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying ( especially carpathia 's ) . his voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue . he also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason . these are just the most obvious and annoying problems . there are too many to list completely here , so please trust me and avoid listening to this book
