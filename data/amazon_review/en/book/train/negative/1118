waste of time ! i 'm so glad i got this book from the library instead of buying it . it was worth the 75c hold fee , but not much more . i was expecting `` stuff you can make with whatever small amounts of yarn you have in your stash '' , but got `` stuff you can make with a few skeins of expensive luxury yarns '' . there are very few projects in here i 'd ever consider making . if i should decide i want to make one , i 'll check the book out again , but i wo n't be buying this for myself or anyone else , ever
