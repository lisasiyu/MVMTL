disappointed lewis ' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but i was disappointed by this book . although interesting , some of the essays are indicative of senility . the title says `` interpreting '' so i will allow him creative license . expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in stalin 's treatise on the u.s. constitution
