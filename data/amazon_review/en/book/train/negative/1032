get a different guide i like rick steve , but he dropped the ball on this book . entries are confusing : he introduces a site , and then does n't tell you how to get there . the maps are terrible . but the thing that really irked me was his section on driving in the czech republic . he said that there were road `` tolls '' you could avoid by purchasing a sticker for your car . that is just plain false . there are no tolls at all . if you do not purchase that sticker , the czech cops will stop you and fine you anywhere from 500 to 15,000 crowns . 1000 crowns = about $ 45 . that 's what our friendly czech officer hit us with
