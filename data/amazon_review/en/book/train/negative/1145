should be titled : history of plumbing for those behind the power curve . i wanted to find out about modern plumbing ( like pex ) and what kind of tools , code changes , etc . that are necessary for installing pex plumbing . not in this book . that information must have fallen through the cracks ( no plumber joke intended ) . author is stuck in the past . needs to be updated , revised , or recycled . kind of a bummer . now i have a book that i ca n't use . sweating copper ... come on now . the rest of us have made it to the 21st century
