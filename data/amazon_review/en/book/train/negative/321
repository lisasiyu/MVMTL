just 'ok' i started reading 'the no.1 ladies detective agency ' but could never really get into it . i liked the idea of this book however so decided to give the author another go . sadly , although the book has some funny moments ( bertie 's tantrums ! ) it never really gripped me . i love scotland but am not familar enough with the places and slang terms so felt i missed out on the 'insider ' comments . the book also has a very poor ending which leaves lots of loose ends and you end up thinking 'hold on what happened to.. ? ' and 'what was the point of ? ' . on the whole it is ok and i imagine if you are familar with edinburgh you would enjoy it more than i did
