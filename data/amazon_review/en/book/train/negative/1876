this can not be for real . i am a black woman who happens to be dating a white man . however , when i first came across this book a few years ago , i was offended and frankly , shocked that something this blatantly racist and disrespectful could have been printed under the guise of a self-help book . whoever the author may be , s/he must realise that the way to make a rational argument to the intended reading audience of black females is not to insult black men , who represent her brothers , her father or her friends . another review on this board took the words right out of my mouth , when it stated that historically , it has been white-not black men-who have perpetuated the myth of the black [ ... ] , and who have been heavily invested in creating a sexually degraded image of the black woman in order to justify his sexual exploitation of her . half of me believes [ or wants to believe ] that this book is actually a satire . i hope one day to have my hopes confirmed !
