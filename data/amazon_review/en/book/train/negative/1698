not near what i thought it would be i was taken aback by how convoluted and overreaching this text was . i guess i expected more . i found myself having to read and reread certain paragraphs and sections of this book just to understand what telford was attempting to say . i found his open hostility toward the traditional position of inerrancy troubling . one reviewer says that work `` shows how the paradigm of inerrancy is fatally flawed . '' he shows no such thing . he approaches the discussion and falls flat in his efforts . one way to make your point it to denigrate your opponent . this he did do . he seemed to imply that all who believe in inerrancy are lowbrow fundamentalists . ultimately , work 's overhaul ( i.e. , paradigm shift ) for viewing the word of god was simply over the top and without warrant . i note that this book came out in november 2001 , but i have yet to see bible colleges and seminaries adopting work 's new paradigm and dialect , and with a sales ranking of 711,096 , his book is likely not going to usher in his `` new paradigm .
