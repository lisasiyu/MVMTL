700+ pages of reader suffering this novel started out pretty good in that i did n't know where koontz was going with martie 's panic attacks and fear of herself . it seemed to take forever for anything to actually happen . the antagonist was a caricature . so over-the-top , it was a job getting through each page . if this had been my first koontz novel , i probably would n't bother with a second .
