disappointing some of the continuations of andre norton 's worlds have been gems , and some of them have been disappointments . beast master 's ark is the worst to date . the original beast master was one of my favorite books , with norton 's classic complexity of phrase , her textured and troubled main character , and her believable yet alien world . this sequel has simplistic language , startling to someone expecting norton 's turn of phrase , and no plot to speak of . the story never generates tension , and there is no climax . mcconchie does a great job with characterization , but good characters are not enough . there must be some story . to add insult to injury , there are multiple typos , and some editing mistakes like tense switching that add to the general sense of a book that is not well written . i am sorry that andre norton put her name to this one
