a wimp of a hero and a predictable villain karen rose became an auto-buy for me after i read her latest , you ca n't hide , then bought i 'm watching you . those two are the most enjoyable romantic suspense books i 've read in a long time . rose made me enjoy a serial killer story - something that had become passe for me over the last few years . i ca n't give have you seen her the same accolades . first , steven thatcher is a wimp , his whining and hanging on to his baggage made him the most unattractive man i 've come across in a romance . that he was the hero truly made this book lose a few stars . special agent , neil , deserved the girl , not thatcher , and jenna should have stuck to her conclusion that thatcher would always be suspicious of any man who so much as spoke to her . i just could n't see how jenna could have her hea with a man like that . each time steven went into his childish knee-jerk reaction , i was willing jenna to forget the guy and look at neil instead . i was also disappointed over how dumb the police were not to guess who the real killer was . all i can say is that i 'm so glad i did n't read this book first when i decided to try karen rose . it would have put me off completely and i 'd have missed the not-to-be-missed books of the two reagan brothers
