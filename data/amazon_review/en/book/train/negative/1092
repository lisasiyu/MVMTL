a waste of money i bought the wharton 's stretching book and liked it , finding it very useful as a martial artist . this book , however , merely rehashes everything in the stretching book , but in an inferior manner . although it has photos instead of drawings , the wharton 's stretch book clearly shows acceptable ranges of motion for each stretch . in addition , the back book has a section on training with weights that bordered on ridiculous . the author 's clearly know little about neither weight training as therapy nor weight training for strength and flexibility . this book was a real disappointment . buy their first book , avoid this one
