what a waste ! this author has so much talent and paints the most exquisite pictures with words but the plot of this book was so fragmented , disorganized and unfocused that it distracted from his lovely writing style . i was n't sure if the book was about jack the ripper , peter pan , alice in wonderland , a christmas carol , losing a child , hauntings , possession , redemption or all of the above because it kept going off in different directions . the relationships between the characters were confusing and the characters were never very well developed . worst of all , it just fell off at the end with no resolution . sometimes this works but it did n't work with this book . very disappointing
