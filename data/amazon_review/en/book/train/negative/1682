disappointed . no useful advice . i bought this book for myself , expecting to find some useful advice to help me organize my day a little better and to stay focused on priorities . i have been in management for 12 years and i expected this book to offer some new insights into time management and other daily challenges . unfortunately , i was very disappointed and struggled to find some useful advice within the first half and have since put it down . the book seems to target a junior audience with a certain type of personality that is more focused on fitting in and accommodating others , rather than those focused on leadership and results . the book itself feels really cheap . i is printed on that cheap news-print paper like those crossword puzzle books .
