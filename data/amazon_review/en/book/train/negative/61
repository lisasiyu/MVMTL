shallow self-indulgence i like to use the amazon reviews when purchasing books , especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items , which usually disuades me from a selection . so i offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - i found it smug , self-serving and self-indulgent , written by a person with little or no empathy , especially for the people he castigates . for example , his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the `` shrink '' bashers of the world . this `` play for effect '' tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me
