terrible mis-representation of the baha'i faith this book has several mentions of the baha'i faith in it , referring to the faith as & quot ; an offshoot of islam & quot ; , and in one part quoting someone as making the baha'is out to look like violent animals . i will never read anything by this author again , she may be aware of iran 's history and politics , but is very miseducated in the area of the baha'i faith ( not bahaism as she writes it ) . the baha'is are quite the opposite of what this author believes
