sometimes witty , often wrong mark steyn in broadway babies say goodnight ( musicals then and now ) has accomplished an unique objective . he has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative , love musicals ( particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen ) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author 's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance . even stranger is that he has found these people and , god bless them , they have the book they have always dreamed about . for anyone else , this can be a bit of a slog . it is funny ( espcially if you like puns ) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless . this book is not truly bad . it is just simply odd . if you like mark steyn ( this book is more about him anyway ) then enjoy . othewise , it is worth a pass
