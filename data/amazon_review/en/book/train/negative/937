endless plotting i 'm a big fan of shogun ( 4 1/2 stars ) and tai-pan ( 4 stars ) and expected much of the same here . but after 450 pages i gave up . plot , subplot , sub-subplot , sub-sub-subplot , scores of characters . i got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle , when i was ready for development and resolution of what came before . this book picks up with the straun/brock rivalry from tai-pan after an interval of 120 years . i wanted that history filled-in ( including the remaining three coins ) , but there was little of that in what i read . the writing is still good and i may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book , but i had to move on to something more satisfying
