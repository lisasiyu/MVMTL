description is misleading the amazon description says vol . 1-3 , boxed set , hardcover . that is all true . what they do n't tell you is that there are actually six volumes . the box in which it comes is clearly marked , `` volumes 1-3 ( of six ) . '' that would have been a much better description for amazon to have used . if you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set , this book is for you . if you are looking for the complete set , look elsewhere
