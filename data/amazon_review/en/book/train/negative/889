a terrible oversight i generally respect hillman , but he has wildly misconstrued the nature of war . his basic failure is an utter lack of examining the gendered nature of warfare . in short : men make war . yes , there plenty of instances where women engage in war , but those are far and away the exception and not the rule . both the leaders who build wars and the soldiers who fight them are almost exclusively male . this is a consistent fact across all cultures around the globe and throughout history . broadly speaking , women simply do not make war . this single and glaring oversight immediately destroy 's hillman 's hypothesis that war is somehow a universal human archetype
