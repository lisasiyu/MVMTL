expensive , complicated , too fancy for me ; too much fish more fish recipes than your normal cook-in-advance books . i did n't want to buy the book , but my cat spilled iced tea on the borrowed copy ( helpful kitty ) . there were a few interesting recipes , but everything was way too complicated and expensive . i have since given my copy to a thrift store . if you enjoy cooking and eating gourmet recipes , but do n't have the time , this might be for you . if you can borrow it at the library ( via interlibrary loan if your branch does n't have it ) you can better judge it . i ca n't recommend it , because i found almost nothing appealing . but tastes are personal , and ymmv . just keep the book away from iced tea and cats
