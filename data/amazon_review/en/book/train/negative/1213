wooden , didactic , and cliched my understanding of theoretical and practical physics ( pick your subdiscipline ) is more akin to catching a glimpse of an intricate structure in my peripheral vision than being able to read the architectural plans . but i do know a good book when i read one . unfortunately , gregory benford 's cosm was not one of them . if he had wanted to explain to non-academics the differences between experimental and theoretical scientists , or to critique the workings of the scientific community , essays would have been a better milieu for the didactic opinions offered in this book . all of these are representative of the way a large proportion of academics see their work and the world , but a better novel would show the reader how these ideas impact the characters through dialogue and action . the characters are wooden stereotypes alert to racial and sexist discriminations more reminiscent of the 1970s than what actually exists in today 's universities ( the novel is set in 2005 ) . the clich√©s make an early appearance with `` this far out from the city , people thought of quality entertainment as a six-pack of coors and a bug zapper '' ( p. 8 ) and continue throughout . all of this is mixed in with a bit of environmental angst as characters note suburban sprawl as an `` upscale fungus '' and see industrial park developments `` crouched down , as if ashamed . '' benford has made modest attempts at providing glimpses of near-future technological advances . in brief , a particle accelerator experiment of the main character , alicia , results in the accidental creation of the cosm , a universe which can be observed ( sometimes directly , sometimes not ) from inception to death throes . she is ( unthrillingly ) kidnapped and escapes . she displays rampant narcissism as she disregards authority and alternates between self-doubt and goddess-hood . and she finds love where she never thought to look .
