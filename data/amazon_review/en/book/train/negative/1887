appalling translation the translation of this work is at best clumsy and frequently appalling . as a previous reviewer notes much appears to have been carried out using , poorly , a dictionary . thus we have `` knife '' used to refer to what in english is commonly called a sabre . the reason being ( i assume ) that the character used to describe the weapon commonly means knife . frequently , she has chosen arcane language . thus we get `` myrmidon '' to describe a senior captain/bodyguard ; the translater not appreciating that the term when used in english literature is either jocular or derogatory . some phrases and clauses are meaningless . it all reflects badly on the editorial team at the chinese university press in hong kong and , unfortunately , tells one much about the standard of english here . where does this leave the reader ? frankly , i can not understand how anyone could give this book a high rating other than out of a desperate desire to read something of this genre . the deer and the cauldron is far superior . this book can only be recommended to somebody who is prepared to persevere with the translation out of an interest in martial arts literature
