review of & quot ; ten days that shook the world. & quot ; although this book may be so brilliantly written by john reed , i found it to be too laden with historical details , and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her ( him ) self with the makings of the russian revolution for the first time . the book provides with a glossary of russian terms , events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so i found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there . however , due to my lack of knowledge of russian history i was unable to piece together any of the information . so , in frustration i gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a & quot ; history buff & quot ; . from this experience i learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing , it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book . the rest of the book should be written according to that outline . a glossary of main events would also be helpful . on the other hand i do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner . anyway , if you would like to expand your knowledge about the russian revolution , i highly recommend this book . however , if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts
