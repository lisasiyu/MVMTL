misrepresentation : this is 1892 deathbed edition ! although the poems are beautiful ... and i certainly do n't mean to bash whitman with this 2-star rating ... it 's the wrong book . not as advertised . this was supposed to be the original 1855 edition . that 's what i expected , and therefore ( in my mind ) what i was paying for . the original 1855 edition , according to modern literary analysis , was the `` strongest/purest '' version . it was the true starting point of whitman 's own ( and consequently america 's ) poetic awakening . consisting of just 12 `` perfect '' poems , it was that edition which emerson praised so highly . whitman never put out another book ... just revision after revision , addition after addition , and edition after edition of leaves of grass ... until you wind up with `` the deathbed edition '' which is a severely bloated and different work from the original . i was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition . which is what the item description says this is . it 's not . be forewarned ... it 's the deathbed edition of 1892 ... nearly 500 pages . and frankly , there are much better versions of the deathbed edition . sturdier versions with nicer pages exist ( this is a pretty weak paperback , printed on pulp pages ) , with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions . shop around . to sum up ... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is , is a terrible way to sell the book . whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate . it just would have been nice to get what i paid for . the `` true '' editon , written by a young whitman at the height of his powers..
