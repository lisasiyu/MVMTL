did n't like the writing style at all i have never read one of johansen 's books and after reading this one , i 'm not likely to read another . i usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means , but i just could n't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing . exclamations such as `` dear heaven '' and `` lord '' were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book , which does n't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone ( it would suit my southern grandma , however ) . as another reviewer said , the big mystery of why daisy would n't leave geneva was n't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted jason to leave she could have just told him . character development was lacking and i just did n't care that much about them . i would have liked to hear more about cynthia and her antics . i did finish the book because i was curious to know what happened , but i could n't wait for it to be over . sorry , but this was not my cup of tea
