how to destroy your relationship with your kids regrettably , i bought this book ( for one cent ) based on the strong reviews . i will never put so much credence in reviews again . this would definitely not be one that you would thumb through at the bookstore and buy . the author appears to have been introduced to child psychology about five minutes before writing this book . his methodology is extremely juvenile and naive . his whole approach is to have an arsenal of canned phrases that you tell your kid for various circumstances . this does n't sound like a bad thing at first until you find out what unimaginative over-simplistic blabber that `` chick '' offers . i could point out samples from every page of the first 25 that i read and the dozen or so others that i then skimmed through . just quoting this pansy-ass fluff turns my stomach . here is a story he tells a speaker who was distracted by a couple of kids talking at a lecture ... `` frowning , he looked at them and very quietly said 'i 'm feeling distracted by your behavior . please make a different choice . ' by telling these students to make a different choice the speaker used language that communicated respect . his message informed them 'i see you as responsible for your own actions . you control your behavior . you choose your responses to life . ' every page has this same sickening tone to it . if you want to avoid reality and miss the opportunities to affect your children in a way that builds self-esteem and confidence in them with real heart to heart interaction and instead gum them up with garbage talk then this book is for you . otherwise , to quote the author `` please make a different choice '' and find a better book or just use your own intuition and common sense . this book teaches you how to destroy relationships by talking in mumbo jumbo out of the side of your mouth , while trying to keep a straight face . a one star rating gives this comic book way too much credit .
