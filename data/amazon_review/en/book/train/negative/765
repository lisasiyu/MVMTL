incredibily unpleasant read i have been a huge fan of the anna pigeon mysteries . the hard truth about hard truth is skip it . it is a very unpleasant experience . the graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill. what i 've loved about the anna pigeon series is that i felt like i got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area . i doubt anna spent more than a night in rocky mountain national park . not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story . the whole thing could have taken place in urban chicago . i have been picking up nevada barr books as fast as i could find them . this book , however , was truely repulsive . i 'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book
