her `` nutrition '' advice made me furious and physically sick alright , first of all , i have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight , etc. , many of which were inspiring and very helpful . i highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge , but if they do , it can be found easily online or in the library . dr. northrup 's advice was ludicrous . 30 grams of carbs per day ? i was encouraged when she began by citing geneen roth , but things deteriorated from there until i wanted to throw the book out the window . if anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food , please , please do not read dr. northrup 's chapter on `` nutrition . '' instead , i would recommend fed up by dr. wendy oliver-pyatt , eating mindfully by dr. susan albers , any book by geneen roth , or even how much does your soul weigh , by dr. dorie mccubbrey . these books adress eating mindfully , allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body 's responses . dr. northrup 's `` nutrition '' chapter is just another externally driven , trendy , but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health ( she calls herself a `` sugar addict '' and if you want information about that , read something like sugar busters ( until you figure out that all diets will never work long-term ) . anyway , i think she 's a nut , and i wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like women 's bodies , women 's wisdom .
