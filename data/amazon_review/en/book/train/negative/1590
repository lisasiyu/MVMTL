i would have to disagree with others while this book does offer some insight to the pitfalls of & quot ; all too common & quot ; web mistakes , i have to disagree with the author 's conclusions in many cases . in particular , he seems to place blame a lot on web developers as though we are often irresponsible , responsible for poorly written content , lackluster site maintenance and other & quot ; bloopers & quot ; as he calls them . fact is , most web developers would love to spend the time & quot ; investing & quot ; in doing a thorough job . however , in many cases , the client often does n't want to pay the additional monies to do a thorough job . while there is enough blame to go around in poor web design , it seemed all to common for the author to blame the web developer for critical mistakes . i also take exception to his commentary at times , in specific , his early mention of enron and an obvious sarcastic knock against the company . he points to a bold claim enron still makes on its site as to its size and stature . while enron may have troubles , it 's still a viable company with many assets and still provides services to many customers . we can do without the authors injection of cynicism and personal feelings about the company to prove his point . lastly , i found the layout to be a little difficult to read . often , the author would reference figures that were one to two pages ahead making you have to skim forward to see what he was talking about . the book is a very large format and anyone with a better sense of book design could have done a better job laying out this book . these are only a few points in a long list of what 's wrong with this book . while the author makes some valid points , i found this book a little too much to stomach . read at your own peril
