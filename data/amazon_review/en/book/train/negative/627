it 's not that bad ... then again , it 's not too good either . if this is your first barbara taylor bradford book , you may never pick up another one . i , on the other hand , like to give an author the three strikes rule , so wo n't hesitate to try something else , but it wo n't be very soon . if you want to read one of her novels , do not start with this one like i did . this is very boring -- like snails serving as soap stars -- not to mention slow and predictable . i listened to the entire thing on cd , but think it was mostly because i liked ms. o'karma 's narration -- she has an appealingly smokey voice like carolyn jones from the adams family . it still could n't save this story with its endless self-serving `` what-about-me ! '' mantras and valentine 's overly moralistic attitude . i 'm the same way , and i bore myself ! you knew from page one where this story was going , and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper . `` i was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me '' resounds every other page , yet she wants to get away from all of that . nothing 's worse than a character or real person who brags , then turns around and screams `` look at me , look at me ... how dare you look at me ? !
