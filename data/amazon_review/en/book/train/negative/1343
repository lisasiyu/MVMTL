sanitised edition i do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment . but i simply can not stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it . this is called censorship , and it gives me the creeps . as a parent , i have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children . so to realise that somebody has been cheating on me , trying to do my job so that i did not have to explain how society has evolved , how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud . this review is about the harper collins edition , edited by patricia c. and frederick l. mckissak , illustrated by michael hague
