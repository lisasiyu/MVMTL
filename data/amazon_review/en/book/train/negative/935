not hippy new age philosophy taoism for good and ill , i am one of the hippy westerners the book talks about . the little i know of taoism i know from a conversation with a friend and reading the tao of pooh . i bought this book while trying to learn more . the book is very up front about contradicting the seemingly widely held ( western ) view that taoism is largely about attitude and how you live life . this book is not about philosophy . the book is concrete how-to advice about practicing taoism in a traditional manner . different sections explain how to make your own altar and wand to use in rituals , why taoists should never participate in felatio , and introduce a whole pantheon of dieties to worship . it would also make a much better source for a school report about a religion than a philosophy text would . in general , i found the book interesting but not what i needed . from the start , i was turned off by the tone of the book . the introduction takes the attitude that new agers are messing up taoism and people interested in it as a philosophy should get lost . it makes some pretty broad declaratory statements about how all taoists live their lives , and tries very hard to push a `` one right way '' to being a taoist . the book could easily be completely right , and i 'm not an expert to say it is n't , but either it was n't what i was looking for or taoism is n't what i am looking for
