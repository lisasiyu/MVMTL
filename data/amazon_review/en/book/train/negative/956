profoundly disappointed i have heard a lot about richard matheson , and when i found out he 'd written a survivalist fiction story ( a favorite sub-genre of mine ) i was elated to read it . however , after a long arduous struggle to continue reading , i realized that disappointment and madness are quite connected . `` hunted past reason '' tells the story of two men : doug and bob . bob , a writer , wants to write a novel of backpacking . doug , the expert , is more than happy to teach him the tricks of the trade . right from the start , we are privy to the personality clash between the two . doug starts out as a `` know it all '' to bob . he tries to bludgeon bob with his vast knowledge of the wilderness . as the story progresses , we see doug 's jealousy of bob 's successful career and family life come to the surface . i must admit that the subtle changes in doug are blended very well into the story . on the other hand , the story was dragged out far too long than necessary . after philosophical discussions between the two ( which are strained at best ) , we see doug 's deep seated sociopathic tendencies which erupt into a game of cat and mouse between the two . after a graphic rape scene , doug gives bob a three hour head start and thus the story turns into `` deliverance '' ( as quite a few readers in this very forum have pointed out ) . the writing seems to be quite repetitive . the mental conversations between bob and his subconscious provide for filler and are thinly veiled attempts at drawing the suspense out . being a fan of this type of subgenre of fiction , i was mildly entertained by the reading , however , i expected a bit more from matheson ( simply because of his fame and influence he 's had on other writers ) . maybe i was a bit unfair , but the other reviews tell me otherwise
