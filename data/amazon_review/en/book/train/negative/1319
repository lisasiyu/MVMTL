horrible ! ! this was the first book i had ever read by this author , and i can sincerely state i will not read another . the way the characters described what the others were doing in conversation was ridiculous . no one - and no one , speaks that way . it made the story feel rushed and stilted , and i am sad to say , much of the humor was lost on me . something funny being told to you is not as funny as witnessing it . i felt the situations would have been much humorous if she described what was happening instead of having her characters describe it in their dialogues . i found it offensive that the women were protrayed by the men as being silly ( something that made me wonder what it was exactly the men saw in them other then the prospect of having sex with them ) , and the abuse situations ms. coulter touched on , then so neatly wrapped up with two of the characters being so heroic was disgusting . she should have never touched on such deep subjects and solved them with more physical violence . the conclusion to this still very real problem rubbed me completely the wrong way . if she was trying to make a social statement on the issue - she failed ... .miserably . reading this book was an utter loss of time . do n't bother
