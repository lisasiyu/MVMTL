utterly overrated i found the characters to be mostly caricatures ; there 's no sense that any of them are actual human beings . as a result , there 's no change -they 're static , and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable . and while much of the book focuses on how different classes do n't truly see each other , forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book , the basts . instead of making them seem real , he reduces them to mere plot devices . in addition , forster , a product of his time , is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race . again , if he intended some irony here ( as , for example , jane austen , who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints ) , i 'd think better of this book . novels typically rely on either a solid plot ( i.e. , the stuff that 's happening ) or on solid characters ( i.e. , the stuff that happens in people 's inner lives ) or both to carry the reader through . i found neither here . at the very least i would like to feel the author 's genuine love of language ; i can forgive a bad book if it 's exceptionally written . i did n't find that kind of prose here . you can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing
