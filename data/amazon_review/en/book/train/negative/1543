outdated living on a shoestring as you may have been reading in the other reviews , this book is very different . most of the suggestions are wacky , and really could only save you pennies to say the least . once in awhile , the suggestions are okay , if you own a home ( which i do n't because i do n't have money ) but if you followed every suggestion in the book you would be the laughing stock of your community . there are much better books on the market for the purpose this book is supposed to serve . if only they would update it , it would n't be half bad . i mean , they talk about going to the library to use internet when almost everyone has internet on their phones nowadays and other wierd `` hints '' that just do n't make sense . they spend a whole section on just organizing your bills and putting them in places like a shoe organizer or an empty cereal box because this will help you save money . real frugal people would just save their money and skip the book to read something that will actually help you
