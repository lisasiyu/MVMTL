save your money this book was a total waste of money for me . the uk english is nearly impossible to decipher at times . it is very difficult reading . this mihgt be a good book for experts but is worthless to the beginner . the author describes repair in detail , but assumes the reader knows all the technical terms being used without explaining them . the drawings are difficult to decipher . photos would have been better . if you are a beginner looking for a good book to get started in clock repair , this is n't it
