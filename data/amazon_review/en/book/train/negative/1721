a disappointing book about a tragic figure after reading robert caro 's masterful biographies ( volumes 1 and 2 ) of lbj , i yearned to learn more about the background of lady bird -- specifically what contributed to her not only staying married to lbj but to singlemindedly propelling his career forward . well , russell 's book certainly disappoints . it is very poorly and awkwardly written and edited . the only new information that i gleaned from this book was gossipy . if one wishes to learn substantive information about lady bird ( and of course about lbj ) , caro 's biographies are a far superior source
