beware - this book is horribly outdated ! if you have acrobat 5 , - fine . or maybe not so fine ... use the money you would have spent on this book and upgrade to the current adobe version : acrobat 7 as of sept 2006 . ..and beware of wiley books that do n't specifiy the application version - - wiley is notorious for this -- remember , when purchasing a wiley book -- think twice if the version of the application is not specified .
