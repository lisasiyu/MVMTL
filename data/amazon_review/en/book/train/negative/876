lost $ 10 i was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did . there is no plot , the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive ( i would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there ) . throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that ?
