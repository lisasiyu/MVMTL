brilliant viewpoints ! why of course the chinese government was entirely to blame for the opium imported by the scotsmen jardine and matheson ! it just like when americans have a cocaine problem , it is the us government , and not the drug smugglers and dealers , that has the responsibility . and if the chinese folks got addicted to this narcotic , well , it 's for their own good you know . at least that 's herman 's view . also , the scots who thus created hong kong for the opium trade did not do all this hard work for money or for themselves . yes , they did make a little money but that 's not why they were in china . they imported opium in order to create hong kong so that one day it will become a `` premier '' commercial city of the orient , with the ultimate goal of teaching china western financial and economic techniques . if it were not for jardine and matheson , how could china have become a great power today , or a candidate superpower tomorrow ? no , these two far-sighted scots had this noble , lofty goal in mind when they came to china , nothing lesss . when historians condemn these two for their `` crime '' ( drug-dealing , that is ) they forget that they are actually heroes , as herman sees so clearly and correctly . and so it is completely unjust that a brilliant people like the scots do n't even have a country they can call their own while the `` barbaric '' and `` decadent '' chinese do
