kind of a disappointment . . . this book , published originally in three installments , is regarded as a turning point in graphic fiction , like dark knight and watchmen , but i just do n't see it . generally speaking , i like gaiman 's story lines , but this time it 's all just confusing . the title character , a crime fighter superhero trying to infiltrate a mob , is killed in the first few pages -- but there 's more of her back in the greenhouse so all is not lost . or something . a newly hatched flower-woman , who seems to share some of the dead one 's memories , sets out to uncover her identity . i think . the mob is run by lex luthor ( why ? ) , who wants to capture her and/or her little sister ( or whatever ) for dissection . but carl , just out of prison , who used to work for luthor and who previously murdered his wife , upon whom the orchids were based , ca n't get his job back and wants to get even with everyone . this guy is a loser and screw-up -- but suddenly , in the last installment , the action having relocated to the amazon basin , he becomes a very talented and successful jungle killer . ( how ? ) other people from the back-story weave in and out of the plot , including one who became the swamp thing , but none of what they say or do makes much sense . and why does batman get a cameo ? ( not to mentioned assorted bad guys from gotham ? ) mckean 's artwork is interesting for its own sake , owing more to oil painting than the usual sort of airbrush work , but all in all , i have to give this a shrug
