what a bore ! this book is such a drag- not for the math bit , but the non-mathematical sections . the stories and ramblings are absolutely unnecessary , and detract from the substance . the problem is that the stories are inextricably intertwined with the math , and quite impossible to skip if you do n't want to miss the math bit . to the extent i was able to drag on , the calculus portions seemed great , but it became too tiresome going through the flab . the great book on calculus has to be `` how to enjoy calculus '' by eli s. pine- a book i regret not having known in my school days
