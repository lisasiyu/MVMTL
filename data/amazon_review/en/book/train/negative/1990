kids do n't want to spend the time coloring i purchased this book for my 2nd grade classroom . with a few exceptions , the kids did n't want to take the time necessary to color in all the designs . they did n't mind doing the math , it was only the coloring that they rushed through . i was disappointed because it seemed like a way to work some fun into the math lesson , but alas , it did n't work out that way
