donna while i have just begun to enjoy this tremendous work that came highly recommended to me , i am already somewhat disappointed in the limited , male-oriented , patriarchal interpretation of some indisputably feminine symbols like the minoan great mother goddess referenced and pictured under the entry , axe on page 16 . described as a 'phallic ' representation of her 'parthenogenetic fertility , ' and as a , 'solar emblem of the 'sky gods , ' and later as an , 'emblem of saint john the babtist , ' this is clearly a female iconic goddess figure holding a double-sided labrys ( axe ) in each upraised arm . the labrys is a feminine symbol associated with the female amazons that were priestesses of artemis , the moon goddess . during their time , lunar energies were associated with the goddess , and feminine power , not masculine , phallic , sky-gods .
