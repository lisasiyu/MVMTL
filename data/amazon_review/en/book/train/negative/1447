this book sucked hard if you read this book -- you can thank the author for making you dumber . if you spent money on this book -- you can thank the author for wasting your hard-earned cash . if you enjoyed this book in any respect -- then you can thank the author for her talent in writing fiction . not only was this book chock full of crap , it did n't at all confer with the people involved to get the facts straight . this is all hearsay and press coverage that anyone could dig up googling the subject matter . now , if you believe what the press tells you -- then you 're a real sucker
