eh ... this book was a bit typical for my liking . the setting was stereotypical only to be mixed in with bland characters , all told through a horribly punctuated journal of a tenth grader who seems like someone who should still be in middle school . through this story jeremy , our lead man , experiences the many things which high schoolers encounter . and what are these things ? why smoking , drinking , partying and sex of course ! all told through immature eyes , making this book one which i did not enjoy very much..
