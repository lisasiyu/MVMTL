this book was a snore i 've heard mr. ziglar speak in person and he was very humerous and captivating . wish i could say the same of his autobiography . he detailed his youth and his family to the boring extreme . he spoke very little about the type of work he does now - only about all the job changes he went through . maybe i expected too much ; but after hearing this man in person i expected much more
