in a word , `` generic '' this is the first book i 've not been able to put down - not because it was so riveting , but because i could n't wait to be done with it . it reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or , perhaps , for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city . the themes , problems and experiences of the stassos family are so completely generic that , should the book be interpreted into any visual form , it would take the shape of the most heavy-handed after-school special ever made ! and as for the `` poetic '' prose that is attributed to this novel : the use of language is over-the-top and often pretencious . many experiences are not simply stated , but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning . one example that i underlined : `` 'i 'm always careful , ' ben said , in exactly the spirit he would toss a too-small offering -- a hibiscus blossom , a pomegranate -- into a crater . '' what ? ! ! ! granted , the context is missing , but even in the context , this quote made me laugh . and by the time i came to the last third of book , the laughter was all that got me though to the end ( that , and the fact that i had to finish it because i told someone that i would . ) if i could give this book less than one star , i would .
