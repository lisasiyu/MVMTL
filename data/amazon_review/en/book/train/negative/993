not worth the money this book is only low to moderately useful to gamers that have been around for a while . if you are new to the game it may prove useful but the dmg has more than enough information as compared to this book . cityscape provided better information and examples and led me to believe that this would be a quality product as well , i was wrong . if you are a collector or just have to have every book published by wotc then i suggest you get it used and save a little money
