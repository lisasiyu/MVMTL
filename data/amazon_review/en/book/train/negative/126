possibly the worst book i 've ever read since i loved jurassic park and the andromeda strain ( way back in high school ) i happily picked up congo at the airport . what an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half . nonsensical details are never explained ( what 's with the gray gorillas and the paddles ? the gorillas were trained by the zing-ites , back in the day , to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it ? this is never made clear ) , the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up , and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional . this is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you 're sol - the plot is not going to come together , and you 're not going to be satisfied . that , plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology , left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute i debarked
