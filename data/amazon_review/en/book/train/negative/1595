us centric - not for ex-pats living & working at country ops long time reviewer , first time critiquer . enough to move me to take time out of my precious schedule to write . as an american living and working abroad for a us based pharmaceutical company , the working mother lifestyle is entirely different . the 100 best companies to work only applies to the u.s. headquarters . the reality is different for the subsidiary or country operations , where resources are limited and the culture is not supportive of the `` flextime '' approach . in fact it is worst , because country operations are forced to `` nudge '' the books and offer what they call contractual permanent roles ( not the equivalent as an employee role ) , which deprive the working mother of the necessary benefits needed to achieve a work-life balance . as an american living in australia , i am appalled , if not dismayed by this severe discrepancy . for ex-pats living abroad , do n't be fooled by the list .
