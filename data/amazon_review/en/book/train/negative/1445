a violent book about anti-violence ... while this book has good intentions , i found it to be the most violent book about anti-violence that i could imagine . the text is not so bad , but the illustrations gave me chills . i thought it could n't get any worse ( guns , knives , etc . ) , when i came to a page where a little boy was lying in a pool of blood hugging a teddy bear . in my opinion , this is not the kind of book that should be viewed by any child , let alone a child who needs a book about anti-violence
