terrible , terrible , terrible ! ! ! this book is terrible , awful , and immoral and if you love danielle steel books ( do n't bother to read this one ) . my fiancee and i love to read to each other and i got angry/mad after reading this book . i just do n't believe that marriage is based on cheating . i think danielle steel may have had one to many drinks while writing this book
