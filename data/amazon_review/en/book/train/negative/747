overkill , indeed i completely agree with the reviewer who deemed this novel `` overkill '' with regards to the puppy mill preaching . those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this book and read it are already well aware of the puppy mill industry . this choir member did not appreciate being preached at for 45 pages of a novel that would have been better spent with more plot development . also , i got a little weary of all the explanations of dog training and akc show terms and slang . again , those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this novel already know what udx , cdx and ofa stand for . readers interested enough in dogs to pick up this book but do not know what bob stands for , what `` finishing '' a dog means , or what an open class is would probably take the time to find out . i would have preferred a patrick o'brian appraoch in regards to the terms and slang . just throw 'em out there for those of us who know , and pique the interest of those that do n't . the way it turned out , however , is that one hundred and fifty pages of a 256 page novel were all either dog show terms explained , or extolling the evils of the puppy mill industry . i am a bit amazed that ms. conant does not say anything at all about the average `` backyard breeder '' who knows nothing of breeding dogs and wants to do it simply because his dog has papers , who do just as much damage to a breed as puppy mills , if not more . go figure . i have two other susan conant dog lover 's mysteries to read , and after this first , i am a little leery of even opening the covers
