stilted and boring ... just finished emily griffin 's something borrowed then picked this one up right after ... what a difference ! love at first site is extremely boring right off the bat and the writing style is so painfully unnatural i could n't make it past the first 40 pages . griffin 's debut , by comparison , is one of the best chick lit novels out there -- very engaging with strong characters and lots of romantic suspense . even if you like british chick lit authors as i do , do n't bother with this one by jane moore
