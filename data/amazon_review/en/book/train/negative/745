too broad and lacks depth this is something for a new manager with little experience in not only systems administration but supervision . this book may give a clue to someone who has just stepped into such a position but provides little depth and direction . unfortunately , there is n't any one book out there as management is a very complex role that encompasses many disciplines , any one of which would be a volume in itself . i was very dissappointed and i find the other reviews misleading
