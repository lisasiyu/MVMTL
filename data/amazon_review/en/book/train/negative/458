marxist propaganda this book is written by an avowed marxist , and as such , neglects to mention the horrors of soviet russia . not only that , ol ' eric discusses how horrible capitalism is , even though it was only because of capitalism that he was able to publish this waste of paper . he does not spend much time at all on world war ii , and has the gall to called richard nixon a horrible president ( which he was ) without heaping abuse upon stalin or any other communists . the book also glosses over most historical events and goes for the `` big picture '' of history . i hated this book . until i read it , i actually enjoyed learning about history . now i am not so sure
