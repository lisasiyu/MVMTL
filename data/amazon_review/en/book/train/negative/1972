oh dear ... . this book doesn`t compare very well with any other recipe books you will have seen - there are no pictures of the finished dishes for a start . a lot of the `` celebrities '' you won`t have heard of - that shouldn`t matter if the recipes are good . its a very american book and doesn`t travel well ; the quantities are measured in `` cups '' , oven temps quoted in fahrenheit only and products not available anywhere else ( what are `` graham crackers '' ? ? ) there are lists at the back of bands with food names and songs with food names ( brilliant journalism girls ) and the authors thank you pages are hilarious - thanking their cats and themselves for the joy-filled experience of working with each other . i realise a recipe book has to have some simple ones included , but hot rod hot dogs - buy some hot dog sausages , buy some white buns , add some relish and mustard . enjoy ! peanutbutter on toast sandwiches , buy some peanutbutter , toast some bread . enjoy ! they`re having a laugh , aren`t they ? but this book is supporting a charity . it doesn`t actually say how much of the proceeds are going to freedom from hunger , just `` some '' ... ..so i suggest you give your donation directly to the charity instead of buying thi
