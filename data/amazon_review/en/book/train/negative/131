whining muckraker wants attention badly , misplaces causality anti-corporate cassandras grind axes to sparse audiences these days . in o'boyle 's piddling attempt to make us outraged at ge , he destroys his own credibility . by attempting to pin every social ill of the late 20th century on jack welch -- a good , if ruthless ceo -- his ideological ship spins wildly out of control . downsizing is his fault . ( hello , organizations are becoming streamlined all over the developed world ) media sensationalism is his fault . ( welch personally delights in the bottom dwelling content of dateline nbc ) anybody who has ever worked for a corporation , especially one as big as ge , knows a few things that should make readers way of o'boyle 's hokey cause and effect analysis : 1 . the ceo does not micromanage his or her company -- thousands of important decisions are made under a ceos jurisdiction every day . 2 . corporations are not social utopias , and should n't be . people get fired sometimes . but people are also given opportunities to do interesting work . and competition is good . 3 . if there is a ubitiquitous problem in society , e.g . families are no longer as stable , a corporation , which is sample unit of social organization , will usually reflect , or possibly be linked more directly to that problem . however , small minds confuse this with causality , not understanding the methodological pitfall of ad hoc ergo propter hoc . for example- families break up more , partially because people do n't balance work and family very well . lots of people work for corporations . corporations caused the decline of the american family . read the book -- o'boyle is guilty of not understanding these truths and more
