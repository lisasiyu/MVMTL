a tragic disappointment i could n't get through this book . i managed to read through the first 5 chapters before getting really irritated at all of the grammatical and spelling errors . it is as if the author did not have anyone edit her work before submitting it to be published . and since it was published by iuniverse , i should n't have been that surprised . also , i was constantly detracted by the overuse and inappropriate use of adjectives , metaphors and cliched phrases . the one thing this book had going for it was the plot . the prologue was the only thing that i would consider decently written in the entire novel . there are glaring disrepencies throughout the novel that absolutly could not be ignored . the characters switch back and forth so much you can not get a grasp as to who they really are . because of this they seem supremely superficial . this book came across as being very quickly written as there are so many jumps from scene to scene and very obvious contradictions that it was really difficult for me to get as far as i did . do not waste your money on this book . the plot is n't good enough to make up for the terrible writing
