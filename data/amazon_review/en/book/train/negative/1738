take what this book has to say with a grain of salt . the spiritual comments are marvellous , but the factual content is dodgy . z. seems to think that a woman will always get her period at the same phase of the moon . but the typical 28-day menstrual cycle is *shorter* than the moon 's cycle of 29 1/2 days , so it wo n't stay in step . ( besides , many women 's cycles are a few days shorter or longer than the average . ) z. also says the earth and sun are getting closer together at the northern hemisphere 's summer solstice ; that 's actually close to aphelion . ( it 's the tilt of the earth 's axis that causes the seasons , not our distance from the sun . ) and as for astrological birth control , and garlic juice as a cure for cancer ... ! an inspiring book - but take it with a grain of salt
