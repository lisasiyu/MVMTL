no , do n't use this . really . i like eyewitness guides a lot , particularly for their glossy graphics combined with comprehensive information , but this really does n't make the cut . how is it possible to cram scotland into 224 pages ? well , it is not . besides having very poor coverage on glasgow and particularly edinburgh , it also has - well , more poor coverage . maps for the bigger islands in northern scotland are sorely lacking . more effort has really got to be invested in making this guide before it is worth your money . i know dk can make some really great guides , so it saddens me that they are now churning out trash like this
