refund requested i have read all four of sarah vowell 's books . i believe that is all of them . i thoroughly enjoyed three of them and would strongly recommend them . with for radio on , her first book , she seems to be in a different place . radio on is a diary of sarah listening to the radio . although the concept is interesting , the result is a lot of very short entries in which there is little opportunity to develop anything . but the real reason i did n't like radio on is because of sarah 's perspective at that time . she is a very critical person in this book . nirvana is the greatest band ever , and the grateful dead is worthless . whether it is music , politics , or a variety of other topics , you get the clear impression that her opinion is right and any others are wrong . radio on is a very mean and negative view of life and our world . the worst case scenario , though , is someone reads radio on first and does n't read sarah vowell 's other books . that would be huge mistake
