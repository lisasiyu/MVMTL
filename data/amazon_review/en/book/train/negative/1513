disorganized abolsutely one of the worst self-help books i have read . there is n't any structure , and it 's not simplistic . the advice given is helpful but the authors then reverse the whole deal . its like one chapter says this will be helpful , and then another chapter says it wont . it just goes all over the place and you cant really follow what the authors are trying to get at . a book i highly reccemend for anxiety and depressive related disorders is `` feel the fear and do it anyway '' much more simplistic , easier to read and get thru . and much more cheerful . i also dont like that these authors have seperated anxiety and depression from one another . i guess they do have a new book coming out that combines them both . it will be interesting to see if they have learned anything from their last two failures . but for someone that wants quick and easy advice , this book is certainly not for them . i 'm afraid that this book of jargon will make it more confusing .
