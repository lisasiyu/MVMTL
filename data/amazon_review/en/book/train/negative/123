shocked . stunned . horrified . i realize that patterson is known for his exciting , page-turning reads . i realize that he is famous for the relentless pace of his novels . and , most importantly , i realize that he is famous for stunning twists at the endings of lots of his books . keeping all that in mind , i have to say that i was shocked and hurt by the , well , absolutely horrifying surprise ending to this book . to say it came at me out of left field would be a massive understatement . it 's more like i was standing at home plate in dodger stadium and was hit by a ball thrown from left field in yankee stadium . truthfully , i never saw it coming . and i was horrified by it . i finished the last pages with my mouth hanging open . and i feel betrayed as well . i realize that twist endings happen often , especially when it comes to patterson , but i did not like this one . i felt hurt by it . putting that aside , it was a good read overall , which is why i give it 2 stars instead of one
