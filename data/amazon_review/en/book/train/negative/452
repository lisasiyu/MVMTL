a good start with a failed ending ... while conway 's idea may have been in the right place , she unfortunatly did not do the required research . i am `` norse wiccan '' but luckily i did not base my tradition on this book ! ( i was forwarned before doing so ! ) for those interested in building a wiccan tradition that is norse or germanic based i suggest the following books : 1 ) wiccan : beliefs and practices by gary cantrell - not norse , but a very good wicca 101 book to serve as a blueprint . 2 ) witchdom of the true by edred - shows how gardnerian wicca has its roots in traditional old english `` wiccecraeft '' and the cults of the vanir from scandinavia who worshiped the `` lord and lady '' ( freyr and freyja ) as there primary deities . you have to read this book ! ! ! it 's availible from runa raven press : http : //www.runaraven.com/ 3 ) hammer of the gods by swain wodening - this is a book anglo-saxon heathenism , but if read the above book , you see why it is nessesary . 4 ) germanic heathenry : a pratical guide by james hjuka coulter - this is the ultimate book on germanic paganism . a must read ! 5 ) northern mysteries & magick by freya aswynn - aswynn is asatru but with a wiccan past , so her stuff tends to be more on the `` vanic '' side . worth a read . using the above books , one can build a `` norse wiccan '' tradition that is based on the historic folk traditions of norse/germanic paganism , instead of the `` fluffy bunny '' and `` new age '' stuff that conway does with this book , which is basically a reprint of her celtic magic book with the names changed to norse gods and goddesses
