disappointing the book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place . then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter , `` barriers to entry '' is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy . this is how the author sets the stage to explain `` competition demystified '' with this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy , the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis . to simplify things , it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers . this approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book `` a radically simplified approach to business strategy `` . granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers . but if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables , then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all ! . in fact one can say `` the end of competition '' . kindly recall `` the end of history ... '' the book however deserves praise for use of game theory in a simple non mathematical approach to analyze competitive situations and the behavior of the players . but again , this approach is just a part of the problem and not a full explanation of competitive strategy . given the speed of globalization and technological changes especially the internet in the last decade , the book fails to incorporate such forces that significantly affect the success of global firms . too voluminous , and fails to impress on what it sets out to accomplish .
