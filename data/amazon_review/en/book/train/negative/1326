lower than low after finishing the thread that runs so true by jesse stuart , i sit here to give you my review on this book . even though the book did n't catch my attention that much it had its ups and downs . the only thing that caught my attention while reading this book was how he fought back against the `` man '' and got his job back , but then he stuck it to them at the end . as for the down points of the book it would have to be the rest of the book . i could not in a million years honestly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book to read
