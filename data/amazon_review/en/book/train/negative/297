disappointing a thoroughly self-indulgent narrator abandons her family on a whim and ventures out ( on her husband 's dime ? ) to `` discover herself '' and experience the kinds of things her priviledged , sheltered life never offered her . the novel is nicely crafted , but the character is shallow and cloying -- sadly , i think we 're supposed to support her . i kept hoping she 'd return home to an empty house .
