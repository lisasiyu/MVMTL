needs editing this is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller . nothing here particularly surprised me . i would guess that if you have enjoyed mr. flynn 's other works you will enjoy this one as well . mr. flynn needs a more assertive editor . his use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story . this probably is n't detrimental to the reader 's comprehension , but it is irritatng . finally , one very minor quibble : non-standard spellings are used throughout ( such as `` harken '' rather than `` hearken '' ) . this may or may not matter to any given reader , but i found it to be worthy of mention
