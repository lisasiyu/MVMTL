basically , its a big , anti-jobs rant . do n't be conned . i 've been in the software industry for quite awhile , and i 've watched as the personal computer industry evolved from one where there were dozens of machines being sold to consumers down to the two primary platforms of windows and macintosh . while there is no doubt that the macintosh is the minority platform , there is also no doubt that its continued survival has engendered an unexplained amount of hate from those who are not fans of the machine . this book , in summary , is the longwinded rant of one such user . as someone who knows first hand a number of the situations covered in the book , and who has a generally solid understanding for situations not covered in the book , i believe the author of this book sat down and wrote it out by himself without any fact checking , without any real interviews ( or he ignored or misunderstood the people he interviewed ) . there are so many factual errrors in this book , its not funny- -from little things like the years events happened or the locations of companies or the person who held a particular role at a particular time , to grossly innacurate assumptions about things the author could not possibly know -- such as the minutes of boardroom discussions . this is a smear job , thru and thru , and like most smear jobs its repetitive , self-contradictory , and downright dishonest . i think the only reason the author has not been sued is that doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves . windows fans like to kick apple and the mac , even when they are down . windows seems to engender some sociopathic sadism in people . if you want to learn more about apple , find another book ... this book is just a windows fan bashing steve jobs for having taste
