not for the solo lawyer ; not about marketing , except for the author i was disappointed by this book . i am a solo litigation attorney , and i read the book to get ideas on marketing . it gave me some ideas . perhaps the most valuable idea was to focus more on customer service ; dahut has an interesting discussion about exactly what that means and how we can do it better . by and large , however , this is a book by and for big firm attorneys . it is about big firm angst and how it can be combated by hiring experts such as dahut to do extensive consulting work for your firm . dahut does not acknowledge , and does not care , that most attorneys are solos or work in small firms , and that we have very different issues than agonizing over whether we have lost our soul by conforming to much to dead firm culture
