a very difficult book to read . thsi book is for someone who has an extense knowledge of the byzantine empire . i do not posses such knowledge and got lost inmediatly while trying to read this book . the author 's style adapts for someone who knows all the history of the people involved in this empire already . i could n't even finish the first chapter because i found myself asking : who is he talking about ? every two lines
