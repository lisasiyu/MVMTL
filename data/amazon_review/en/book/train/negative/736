why three plot lines ? candace bushnell wrote `` lipstick jungle '' from the perspective of three different narratives : wendy , the movie executive , nico , the editor of chief of bonfire magazine and victory , the fashion designer . at times it gets sort of confusing who is who and the reader is left with the feeling that the author had three good ideas for three new books and somehow put them all in one . it is interesting however , to see selden rose , a character from `` trading up '' , reappear in this novel , good to know that he has recovered from the failed marriage to janey wilcox . all in all the relationship between the three main characters remains unclear throughout the entire book , they just seem to be acquainted with each other for no apparent reason , occasionally talk or lunch together and talk about their individual lives .
