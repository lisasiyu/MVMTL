not even good science i ordered this book hoping for some scientific evidence supporting what i already knew from personal experience ; that there is a gestalt emerging from all of the beings in the universe . an emergent property that some call `the spirit that moves through all things ' and some call `god ' and i was hoping that this book would call it gaia . bah ! the author totally ignores the metaphysical evidence and misrepresents the impact of civilization on the natural world . he also misrepresents the relationship tribal aka primitive cultures had with the natural world . furthermore , this is n't even good science . typically i pass books on to friends or trade them at a used bookstore . the best thing about this book was how easily the pages tore out to become kindling for my fire . if i could i would give it a negative rating -- do n't pollute your mind with this trash
