more colonel and less general i have read many books on wwii from many perspectives and have been to visit the d-day beaches four times . i can not visit the american graves in normandy without being moved . twice i have had the experience of hearing taps played near omaha beach . i have the utmost respect for all those who fought and died . i had high expectations for the book . my problem is that the book never finds its voice . at times it is the four star general writing with his perspective of high and at other times it is the young colonel leading his men . i wanted to hear more from this man . just as he starts to share , the general leaps in and throws off the narrative . let the colonel talk about his artillery missions and show me more of how his experience was different . ( a few photos and maps would be nice ) . if the general needs to talk , give him a separate chapter at the end of the book . we hear from the privates and generals but not the majors and colonels . their voices could add to the history . i wish the colonel would have spoken for them
