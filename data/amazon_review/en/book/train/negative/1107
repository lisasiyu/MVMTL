fallacious arguments undoubtedly , felons who commit heinous crimes deserve to be sentenced to death . there is no argument there . in my view , child molestors , murderers and rapists have forfeited their legal right to live in our society . it should be stressed that a gruesome deed must not be justified under any circusmtances ; if a malefactor has had a difficult childhood this can not excuse let alone justify his actions . this is irrefutable ! as is well-known , psychopaths are usually cunning , insidious , manipulative , narcissistic and charming . moreover , they are unable to feel guilt and remorse . rehabilitation is effective in some cases but in most cases it does not work . notorious felons are known to relapse into criminality upon release . psychopaths can often deceive their psychiatrists because they are manipulative and shrewd . therefore , capital punishment is the most effective punishment next to life sentence
