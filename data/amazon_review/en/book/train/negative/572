not one of quindlen 's best this book was easy enough to read , it just was n't what i expected from quindlen . i usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating , in this book i really did not find either of those traits to stand out . the back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing , and sometimes i was in the middle of a paragraph before i realized this paragraph was a jump to the past , whereas the previous paragraph was present time . although i got used to that writing style , i always found it annoying . the storyline itself never sold me either : a typical , young `` sew-your-wild-oats '' boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the `` perfect '' father . i just did not find such an occurrence likely . and , as a mother myself , all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm . anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me , and a disappointment especially since i have been a quindlen fan for many , many years
