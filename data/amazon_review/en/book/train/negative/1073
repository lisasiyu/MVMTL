this author has zero credibility why should we take anything this author says seriously . he 's last and only other book was a national enquirer style tell or -- or rather tell nothing -- about a friend who trusted his confidence -- jfk jr. bradley cant even use his real name -- richard blow . he 's a phony and he decided to try to add some panache to his alleged role as a writer by doing a `` serious book about an institution . '' i read the book ... it 's all speculation based on zero research . it 's essentially a cut and paste job . forget it . dont waste your time .
