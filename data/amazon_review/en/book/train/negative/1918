dated and best-forgotten the low-point in the great man 's career , the book shows little feel for rock and roll and its hippy messiah of a protagonist is almost as embarrassing as jim morrison himself was . the lyrics are especially awful and the whole thing seems dated - like most genuine late 60s / early 70s rock . de lillo went on to much , much greater things , which is what you should read instead
