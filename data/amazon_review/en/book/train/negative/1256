lighten up , folks ! the author has provided the context in which he wrote this book . as an adolescent boy in the 1970s , i found it an interesting read . since i had the good sense to not attempt any of the hare-brained schemes in the book , i am still healthy and have all of my limbs . if people are interested in improvised munitions and the like , there are at least six ( 6 ) us army fms and tms on the subject that i am aware of . bear in mind that the making of explosive devices is a serious felony , and should not be attempted without the proper federal and state licenses and permits . batfe does not take kindly to the making of unregistered and untaxed explosives
