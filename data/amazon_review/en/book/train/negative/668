implausible thriller with a twist that just does n't work having a novel 's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre . when this plot device is done well , the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist , not left wondering what the hell happened . when the twist works best , the author has n't actually lied to the reader , but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions . when the twist comes , the reader experiences a `light bulb moment ' , realizing they were duped , but that they should have seen it coming . in beach road the ending does n't make much sense , and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed . beach road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying . my question to mr. patterson is : if one of the characters lies to the reader for the first ï¿½ of the novel , why do they start telling the truth near the end ? why not lie all the way through ( or tell the truth right from the beginning ) ? i think it would have been much more interesting if the character 's lies were exposed , not by their own confession , but through the observations of other characters . of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel . my other major gripe is that so much of it does n't make sense . for example , the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows . somehow loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing . this is ridiculous . drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find . how else do people buy drugs from them ? it 's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing , even with silly nicknames . second case in point : the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains , yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen . they do n't notice the absence of blood , and do n't check to make sure the shot was fatal . it does n't make sense . patterson churns out novels faster than nora roberts these days and apparently is n't worried about quality . beach road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a patterson novel to avoid .
