not good ... .except for jim lee right lets make this very clear there are only 3 good issues out of the nine here ... the actual x men issues with art by jim lee and scott williams are essential ... claremonts words and lees pencils have always been a good combo ... the fight scenes are dramatic and exciting and everythings ... well ... everythings just right however the other 6 coming from new mutants and x factor are crap ... the arts rubbish and especially by the last 2 chapters you just want it to end ... seriously it just drags on ... they lose their powers get em back ... still they get beat down . dont know about you but i dont particularly enjoy watching the x men lose fight after fight after fight ( which they seemed to do a lot of in the late 80s early 90s ) unfortuantely its quite an essential story as it brings all the x men back together after a few years apart buy it for jim lee and try to stomach the other stories
