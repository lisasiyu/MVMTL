a good book , except for the writing jim ainsworth clearly demonstrates his extensive financial consulting experience throughout this book . much of the information is valuable , and it covers the important beginners ' range of knowledge effectively . however , his 'down to earth ' style is not only irritating , it actually makes the book painful to read . good written english is not always the same as good spoken english . surely the man is a succesful financial consultant , but that does n't make him a good writer . it just goes to show that in a hot , growing industry like financial consulting a book written by a 'qualified ' author will sell even if it is poorly written
