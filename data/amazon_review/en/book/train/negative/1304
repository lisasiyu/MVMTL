freedom train : a boring book about a slave this is n't a very good book . it might be good if you 're in love with history and you like reading 'harriet freed slaves . she took them to canada . ' over and over again . someone would read this and think harriet tubman was boring . if this is harriet tubman 's life , then my life is cool . in other words , beware . this book is only for school reports . i would n't say this is a good book by any means . it 's like being in slavery when you 're reading this . i 'd do math homework before this even crossed my mind
