disappointed i was excited to get this book , since i am a stay-at-home mother of three . i believe that it 's important to take care of yourself and feel confident in your decision to be a mother . this book did n't really give much advice . it skimmed the surface with suggestions about dressing cute , exercising , taking time for yourself ... things i 've heard a thousand times before . i like to hear real life tips on how other mom 's do these things and more . i thought the book was a rip-off with no real content . a much better book , if you stay at home with your kids is happy housewives by darla shine .
