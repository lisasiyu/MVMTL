based on the wrong premise the authors of this book seem to believe that the best individual performers should become managers - that is not something that i can agree with . it is full of pompous language ( i do not want to see the word empowerment again in my whole life ) instead of real-world advice . i simultaneously bought the book first-time manager and it is much better
