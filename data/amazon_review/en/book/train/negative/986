lack of character although the book may be poetic and lyrically written , the superfluity of figurative language and abstract narration makes it difficult to extract the true meaning behind its short stories and anecdotes . the lack of definitive characters , names , and personalities make it difficult to tell exactly what is going on and completely renders character development obsolete . the book , although it addresses very real tensions on several factors , fails to drive home the significance of tribulations and common place yet serious issues that the migrant workers deal with because of it 's occult language and stream of conscious stylistic writing . if you can read spanish , the original is far more impactful than the translated version , but still leaves the reader in an unsatisfied state of confusion as to what actually happened . for those of you who do not care for stories without a story , this book is not for you
