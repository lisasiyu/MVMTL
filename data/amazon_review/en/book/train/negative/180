got bored quickly my roommate gave me this book and i thought it would be a good read during the winter break ( i am a college student ) . halfway through chapter 2 ( pg 18 ) i decided to stop reading the book . the book can be summarized by saying that we human make decisions based on feeling and not logic . this book explains why is that . but it does n't teach you how to become more logical
