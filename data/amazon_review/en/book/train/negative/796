stay back reading this book was exhausting , confusing , and extremely unsatisfying . sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information . some major elements that are introduced are left hanging ; never brought up again . others are revisited ad nauseum . barr 's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading . although i did stay with it until the contrived end , this is the first book i ever attacked with a red pen and edited a i went along . i estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter , and have carried far more impact , without the extraneous language . i am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books . i 'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic p.d . james or a pure and simple sue grafton
