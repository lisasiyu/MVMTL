chaotic yet `` all life/ has song ... '' stan rice announces at the start of `` singing yet , '' chaotic collection of poems from his prior three releases , plus several new poems . rice ( who sadly passed away at the end of 2002 ) displayed a flair for evocative imagery , but his poetry is so confusingly random that it 's almost impossible to decipher . the first parts of the book are a tangle of bizarre eroticism ( comparing melons to a woman ) and odd morbidity ( `` it is death's/drizzle we write/checks on/when we die/we bounce '' ) . but in the `` some lamb '' section , rice delved into some deeper , more real turf : the death of his daughter from leukemia . `` we stopped beside a hole where she/was put by men who could not see . '' with an actual focus , rice 's poetry shifts into aching confusion , describing his daughter 's illness , death , and burial , all the emotions that came with it . unfortunately , rice 's poetry does n't improve after that , including in the stretch of new material at the end of the book -- while his style mellows out a little , rice 's poems are still surreal and still nonsensical . `` the iceplants/turn to the sun/their purple/sadist flowers ... '' dreamlike poetry and strange images are not a problem . but rice 's poetry goes beyond strange and into incomprehensible . `` golden silver copper silk/woe is water shocked by milk/heart attack , assassin cancer/who would think these bones such dancers ? '' he announced at one point . okay , whatever . maybe it 's about death . interpret that as you will . while his poetry can be intriguing and seductive , most of the time it just seems like cool phrases tossed randomly together . certainly rice ca n't be faulted for his lack of description . he could evoke astoundingly weird , dali-esque images . the problem is , they seem strung together like beads . rather than focusing on one and exploring it , he seems just to have tossed them together randomly , assuming that they will see profound despite their lack of connection . `` thunder no more , sky/big sandwich gold & coral '' -- it does n't evoke anything by itself , and it seems completely disconnected from what comes after it . an overview of stan rice 's poetry , with a stretch of new material , `` singing yet '' does n't shed any more light on what went through his head . nor does it make his random poetry any more appealing .
