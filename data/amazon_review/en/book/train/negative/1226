disappointed i picked up this book after reading about it on the simple living network , which i found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late joe dominguez and vicki robin and their work & quot ; your money or your life & quot ; . unlike mr. dominguez and ms. robin , who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living , ms. andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism . after reading dominguez , this book is disjointed , preachy and quite frankly , bad . that 's not so say that ms. andrews does n't have some good ideas . she does , but as with so many anecdotal books , they 're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way . if you live an environmentally sensitive life , ms. andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself , but if your goal is to simplify your life , you could do better than spending time on this book
