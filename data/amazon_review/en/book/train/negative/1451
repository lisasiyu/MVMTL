what a disappointment i expected so much better . the first two novels in this trilogy were very entertaining and managed to weave both dramatatic historical events with classic family tensions , particulary with the cheney sisters . each character including the tertiary characters were well defined . in this one , the other cheney sisters never even show up and unfortunately it is a glaring omission . predictable and boring from beginning to end . sadly , much like the heroine
