a good , but biased , introduction to globalization . in this work , bhagwati offers valid arguments for globalization . he is takes some of the strongest criticisms of globalization and is able to find fault in them , and at the same time , declares the benefits of a globalized economy . however , one need not read the entire book to find out bhagwati 's views . bhagwati 's stance on globalization is almost so extreme that he instinctively and automatically comes to the defense of globalization without providing a fair analysis . as a harvard professor , i would assume him to provide more academic and holistic defenses and criticisms . however , his book is an easy read and one that opens the reader to arguments for and against globalization whether s/he has previous knowledge of globalization or not
