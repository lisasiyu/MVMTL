my willing suspension of belief became unwilling i liked this novel at the beginning . the cast of characters was good . as comic relief i thought hannah goldsmith was great -- and , speaking euphemistically , the tension about progress , or lack thereof , in her love life was of considerable interest . what killed the story for me was the coincidences : too many , too unlikely , too intrusive . we are supposed to believe that chief inspector detective wexford has a very similar situation in his home to the murders he is investigating . we have about every character and suspect in the novel being related to each other in one way or another . by about page 250 of a 320 page novel i had had enough . the author had blown her believability . ruth rendell is , of course , one of the best known of english detective novelists and has many loyal fans . perhaps she 's written better books . i hope so . but do n't choose this one to read unless you are really , really a fan . smallchief
