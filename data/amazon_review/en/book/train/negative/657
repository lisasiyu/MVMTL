the scarlet letter - should have been a short story i am going against the grain here but can anyone explain how this story can take so long to tell . trying to enjoy the majority of american authors , hawthornes works have not be an easy go . though admittedly not a fan of hawthornes full length works , his short stores can be enjoyable . but a book that begins with 28 pages of 'the custom house ' , before the story even begins , is already very dull . i , like many other people , was forced to read this work for a sophomore literature class . that was 31 years ago and i still remember thinking what a moderately entertaining short story this would have made . in its form , its unbearable .
