too liberal the authors cover many of the events that occurred during the timeframe so i believe you can get some decent background info from the book . however , it is very political and seems to blame the country for not adopting a social welfare state much sooner . in many areas , it is too superficial and quickly concludes & quot ; where was a government program to cure these ills of history & quot ; and does n't really explore the causes of problems . case in point , american farmers fed the world during ww-1 as european agriculture was in shambles . that allowed american farmers to enjoy strong prices and high incomes in the war years . but in the 1920s , the european farmers were back and the market suffered from classic oversupply and farm incomes declined . the authors do n't report that or even classify the war years as an anomoly for farmers . instead , they focus on the unfairness that the farmers did n't participate to the same degree in the prosperity of the 1920s . the tone gets very upset with thoughts that the federal government should have prevented this like our wonderful never-ending farm programs of today that have us subsidizing the growth of tobacco and mohair wool . in other areas , the book is wrong . for example , it traces the formation of the federal reserve system to jp morgan 's inability to stem the bank failures and outflow of gold in the panic of 1907 . actually , morgan was very successful in rescuing the powerless federal government and raising gold in europe to prop up our banks . the federal reserve system arose as the government was worried about having one private man being able to wield so much financial power . all in all , the historical background is there and is a good primer , but be prepared to listen to a lecture of what is fair and right and what is not
