flatland is boring flatland is for advanced students -seniors and up- who are participating in a physchological study class . this book warps your thinking about the geometric rules . unfortunately , it is written in such a way that even if you are a very concentrated reader , you can not read a paragraph withouth being distracted . the diction in this story is made to be boring . a teacher assigned freshmen students-in high school- to read this and everyone complained because it literally takes and hour to get through a couple of pages . you must also reread the text to find some sort of meaning . this book is not meant for anyone under 18 and is certainly not enjoyable for leisurely purposes
