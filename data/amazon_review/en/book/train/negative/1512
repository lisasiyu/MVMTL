stay clear of lonely planet a hopeless mess of headlines and confusing comments , very little structure . no rankings of what you should see and do , no pictures , no useful restaurant and hotel recommendations . endless yatter about nothing makes this a boring read with almost no real content . absolutely worthless on our japan trip to tokyo and kyoto . this is not the first time we have been disappointed by lonely planet . they cater to backpackers only , usually looking for the cheapest accomodation and meals , and with no value added for the traveller who is short on time but still wants to make the most out of his/her time . we ended up buying the eyewitness guoide which is fast and easy to use .
