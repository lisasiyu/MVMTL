unendurable this book was on somebody 's amazon.com listmania for sea turtles , so i hunted it down . it is only vaguely about sea turtles , in that it is set on an island in georgia where sea turtles nest . there is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book , and then he disappears , so it 's obvious that he was involved in the crime . there are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable . i wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and i ended up skimming the whole thing , looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction . skip this book and send your $ 6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead .
