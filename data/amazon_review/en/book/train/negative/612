ok for the beginner - but even then not that great i was given this book for free by the owner of a bookstore when i told him that that i was starting a bookstore . i learned maybe , oh , 5 or 6 things that were slightly important . i especially learned how radically the bookmarket has changed in such a short period of time , and how mired in the past this book is ( even with it 's new chapter on the internet ) . in any business , there will always be a middle man- but the face of the middleman in the book business is so changed that it is tough to write a book that stays current . for the young bucks starting in the industry , do subject and content searches of discussion boards hosted by the big bookselling pages : amazon.com ( most useful ) , and abe.com . getting a part time job doing grunt work ( shelving , cleaning ) at a local used bookstore will provide you with more practical education in a day than this book will .
