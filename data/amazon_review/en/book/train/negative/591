not as good as accidental tourist i read this book after being enchanted by the accidental tourist and other of anne tyler 's books . this book deals with the life of a depressed teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you , i would not recommend reading it . on the up side , it 's really short so you can get through it rather quickly . i was hoping to read a good book , but only felt worse after finishing this one
