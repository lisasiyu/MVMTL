how bush became the worst leader ever ! ! ! ! between sending our country to war over false pretenses ( ie ; bush 's personal greed ) , terrible response to hurricane katrina , this whole anti-gay thing , and the failure that was no child left behind , i 'd have to say that bush is not a very good leader . that and the guy ca n't seem to acknowledge btw , i myself am not gay but see nothing wrong with it . if you can see it in no other way , the gays might strike back , the way the blacks reacted to whites ( and believe me , they had a good reason to ) when they were being treated like crap in the '60 's . so unless you want riots through your city , you 'll at least try to be tolerant . this goes out to all you anti-gay people . and remember ; do n't hate people without logical reason ! ( see , i have good reasons to hate bush !
