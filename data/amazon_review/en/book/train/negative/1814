this book is now obsolete with new findings from a scientist of the los alamos laboratory , the main thesis of this book-that the turin shroud is a medieval forgery-has been dealt a death blow . the new information clearly shows that the portion of the shroud used for the 1988 c-14 test was , in fact , an additional weave to the shroud threads made much later than the cloth itself , and that the winding sheet is much older than c-14 indicated . even without this explosive new information , much of nickell 's thesis was outdated well before the year 2005 . his `` recreations '' of the shroud are amateurish and are not clear evidence of forgery . most of his other information- '' paint on the shroud '' , no provenance before the middle ages-has also been debunked many times over . and his star witness , walter mccrone , had his own reputation tarnished beyond repair when it was proven that his analysis of the vineland map was discredited and debunked ( ironic , since both nickell and mccrone tried to destroy and besmirch those who did n't agree with them ) . in short , nickell 's book is now passe , and obsolete . it gets two stars for its entertainment value , but the main arguments and ideas of this book have been thoroughly refuted , once and for all .
