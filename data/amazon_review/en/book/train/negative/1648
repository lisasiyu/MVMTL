what about `` nunning ? '' i am not surprised nugent does n't mention what he once claimed was his favorite teenaged pastime , `` nunning . '' in an interview for `` oui '' magazine in the early 80 's , nugent was all too ready and willing to explain to the interviewer just what this `` nunning '' was . as nugent explained it : he and a friend would drive around churches , convents , catholic schools etc . with whichever one of them was on the passenger side having a large street map laid out on their lap . underneath the map , nugent and pal would have his zipper undone and his penis hanging out . when they would spot a young nun who looked naive enough , they would ask her through the halfway opened car window for directions to a certain street or road . as she would walk over , the jerk with the map would playact at being confused , looking dumbfounded at it . when the poor sister would reach into the car so she can get a better look at what nugent and friend were having trouble , nugent or friend would then quickly roll up the window thus trapping the now terrified nun . then nugent or friend would toss away the map waving their penis in the poor nun 's face and fondle her chest . this is the guy who has so much to say about morals , ethic and right living . this guy is a degenrate and his conservative republican friends are all hypocrites when they have so much to say about `` liberal celebrities '' and never even acknowledge what this guy was so proud to brag about back in the 80 's
