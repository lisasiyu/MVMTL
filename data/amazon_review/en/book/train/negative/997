a step back i have been reading this book for a graduate level art education course . in this book kochman makes many broad generalizations that , while he may consider them true , are belied by the way he phrases them . he makes many absolute statements about the behaviors of both black people and white people and the way in which he writes leaves no room for deviation . i would recommend this book if you are curious about why racism is still a problem in this country . the problem of racism will only begin to be alleviated when people stop making broad statements that stereotype races or cultures as behaving in a particular way . kochman does not seem to realize this
