worst travel book that i have ever read ok , buenos aires is a spanish speaking city ; but when every other word of a sentence in this book is full of spanish , it makes the book very very hard to read ! ! ! ! `` facts about buenos aires '' is nothing but that , a list of useless facts emblished with unnecessary adjatives : `` ... something that differentiates buenos aires ' people from their north american or european cousins - a striving melancholy and a desire for something greater . '' hm ? ? ? what we travelers want is an easy to read book , not a trash compactor , too much information one after another in a paragraph with vague english + foreign words is a waste . the few pictures in this book do n't do justice to the city , take a look at any `` paris '' book out there , your response is usually `` wow , i would like to go there . '' after reading this book , it 's like `` hm ... why do i want to go there ? '' choose a different book ; do n't waste your time and money
