not one of her better ones ... i 've been a fan of this series for years , but this one was really disappointing . one almost gets the impression that braun herself has lost interest in the series ... ( if she even writes the books anymore ! ? ) of course , the books have always been slow , but they did have a certain charm to them , making them the perfect bedtime material ... but , boy , did i sleep well , when i was reading this one..
