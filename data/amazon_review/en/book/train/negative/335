count me in the minority unlike most reviewers here , i really disliked this book . the main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance . there is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity . the characters , especially the protagonist iris , are bores . iris is like a 300 page wet blanket . most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs . her sister laura is the exception , but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness . the story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else . the science-fiction meta-story within that story i thought was the most interesting part of the book , but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent . finally , this is my second atwood book , and i really dislike her writing style . it reads as if she is trying too hard , and even the simplest situations feel forced . i do n't understand why everyone seems to like this book , but i would just suggest not to believe all the hype .
