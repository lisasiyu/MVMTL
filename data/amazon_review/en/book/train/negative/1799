better than roark 's formulas for stress & amp ; strain . this book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories . the book is basically an oversized machinery 's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that do n't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation . if you do a lot of strength of material design i would suggest a machinery 's hand book , or the mcgraw hill mechanical engineering design book which is an excellent p.e . exam reference book . stay away from the roarks formulas for stress & amp ; strain book its more poorly written then the marks
