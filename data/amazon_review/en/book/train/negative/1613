alot of fluff this book has some good information in it , but it is mostly fluff , filler and repetition . each time i sit down to read it , i fall asleep because there is so much filler . the book could easily be reduced to a pamphlet-sized book without any sacrifice of information . i like to know how and why , and i do n't mind reading on and on if the how and why is explained . i even enjoyed the china study , which has a lot of explanatory text to support statements . most people would call the china study a dry read , but every word has a purpose . the miracle of fasting is mostly just empty words with statements only weakly backed up by the author 's personal observations , not science . i think there are some useful tidbits in this book , but i would suggest you borrow this book from a friend or the library if you can . i am hoping to find a more comprehensive book on the subject of fasting . any suggestions
