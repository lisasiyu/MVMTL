take a different class after a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors , brehm , kassin , and fein , leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money . after reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand , but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous
