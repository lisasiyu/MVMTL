your head will split open and ooze goop after reading this all i can say is pass me some aspirin . this is a dozy of a bad novel . as it says on the dust jacket , a supreme court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased . its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit . at the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence . not only does he deal with his family , but his brothers friend , a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for . and that 's only the start of the plot . its really pretty bad , it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions . the characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways . baldacci is along with james patterson and dean koontz one of america 's worst authors . if you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this , try one of harlan coben 's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character myron bolitar in it . or for a more sophisticated read , look for denis lehane , he wrote the amazing mystic river , but his pi series located in boston is pretty good as well .
