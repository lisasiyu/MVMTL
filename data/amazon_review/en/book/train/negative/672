old-fashioned elitist boredom this is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s -- a time when `` a yarn '' was n't an archaic term . does it give some helpful hints ? sure , there 's the obvious ones like show do n't tell and all characters have free will . but fiction has changed a lot since henry james ( thankfully ) , and this book might be better left unread . plus , i do n't buy the `` only people who are n't well-read do n't like it '' argument . i 've read nearly all the books mentioned and i still wish i never bought this book
