crank-theory and work of an amateur a poory written , racially charged work by a bitter , probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a `` key '' to historical development . in addition to the cycle of history thesis , he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle , spengler points to a nation 's `` will '' and race as the key to a `` kultur 's '' success . this is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to national socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction -- facts be damned . interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis .
