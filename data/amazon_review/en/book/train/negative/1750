disappointed mac user i bought this book expecting to be able to find exercises that would help me really learn the product . boy , was i in for a big surprise . if you 're a mac user , forget it ! this book assumes you 're using a pc . last i checked , many people who do web design are mac users . when i got to the first screen and saw that what was shown in the book was different than what i had on my computer , i gave up . it may be helpful for pc users , but if you 're a mac user consider yourself ignored . . . yet again
