ms nettleton seems sincerely deluded ... : -0 this book is hilarious , evidently written toungue-in-cheek . it is also at least to some extent fictitious , regarding her personal experiences , so perhaps it is best read as such . one example of this is that she states her fourth husband `` bill '' 'has no children of his own ' . this is untrue . he has three children he adopted and then chose to walk out on . perhaps ms. nettleton was unaware of this fact at the time her book went to print . that would , however , not really speak well to her doing due diligence on her suitors before marrying them
