daring ? how about do n't you dare buy this book ! note : if i could give this 0 stars , i would i picked up this book on the strength of the high recommendations listed here - i guess i should have looked at the fact that there were only ( 5 ) reviews . this book was trite , un-even , and just plain ridiculous . it started out with a decent enough premise but did nothing to really build the relationship between the hero and heroine . maggie came off as a young , naive , totally unrealistic , `` i 'm trying to be cute & pert '' but , i 'm not . it 's almost as if the character `` ally mcbeal '' were thrust into a book . the plot veered off in directions that did n't get tied up and the hero , connor , seemed to be spouting lines because that 's what he was supposed to say rather than what he felt . also , there was n't too much of anything that was daring in this book . just ugghhh ! i feel sad that i dared to buy this . just run the other way - get something by gaelen foley ( the duke ) or lisa kleypas ( dreaming of you ) instea
