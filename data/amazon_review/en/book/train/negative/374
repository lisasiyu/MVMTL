incomplete for a 270 page book that focuses on only one subject , `` the homocysteine revolution '' should have included much more iformation on what a person should do in order to have favorable homocysteine levels -- especially when it comes to diet and other lifestyle habits . i bought this book for my father , and he and i were very dissapointed that the book for the most part negelcted this important matter , other than advising people to take b-12 , b-6 , and folic acid supplememnts .
