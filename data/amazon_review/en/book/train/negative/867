glad to be done with it . predator is the worst book i have read in 2 months ( i read a lot of books ) . it is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events . the characters are poorly drawn ( i hardly recognized the scarpetta and marino of earlier books ) . the transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak , leaving me feeling : `` huh ? ? '' this the fourth ( and it will be the last ) book by cornwell that i have read . it was totally disappointing and i spent extra time on it just so i could complete it and `` forget about it ''
