what a crock ! this book demonstrates the sloppy scholarship of a high-school dropout . his theology was discarded by his organization as soon as the megalomaniac died . he was as wrong about history as he was about theology . it has also been disclosed that he copied much of this book from another author 's earlier publication . this man has been discredited as a theologian long ago
