this book really wants you to know it 's a book ... i like self-reference jokes . i enjoy them quite a bit , actually . but this book beats you over the head with it . i wanted to read the whole thing , just so i could feel like i had a more informed opinion than i would otherwise , but i got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better . i see a lot of reviews full of praise here , but for me reading this was incredibly tedious . he lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on the real world . the only reason i gave this book two stars was because i did n't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we 're shown how arrogant the main character is . but i do n't really care , i hated it .
