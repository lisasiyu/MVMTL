useless this book has no useful information in it . the pictures are pretty , but i do n't spend good money on a book just to look at the pictures . even the ideas are n't all that creative . if i had cupboards full of antiques and drawers full of beautiful linens , i would n't need a book to tell me how to use them . other , better books show the same techniques and ideas , and show them with materials more easily available to us mere mortals . the example that really did me in was the little girl 's birthday party ... with crocheted lace doilies on the drinks glasses , and all the little girls in edwardian-style lace dresses . please ! you want an example of a pretty child 's birthday party , get the shabby chic entertaining book
