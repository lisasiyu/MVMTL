of two minds , again the story is quite clunky and contrived , and yet , i still ca n't help but feel some affection for it , as , despite my opinions of mr. roeder 's talents , he clearly feels deeply for his characters , and their none-to-realistic world . the good things are here -- while the characters are cardboard cut-outs , and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers , their plight is still quite a bit involving . my negatives , though , really spring from the way the plot unfolds -- far too quickly and far too coincidental . i know that the chamber of horrors at the `` mental hospital '' is not far removed from reality , but for a lot of the story , the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear . and i ca n't quite parse the way mr. roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting , and then throws on paranormal experiences . as escapist literature , i 've read worse , but for something that seems to be striving towards realism , i just do n't know
