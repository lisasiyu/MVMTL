very out of date while avalon aka windows presentation framework is still in beta , i had hoped that the code examples and references in this book would not be far out of date . i am finding that they are dramatically out of date ( writing this review 04/27/2006 ) . this is not to criticize the quality of the book or of the content ; it appears to be well written . however , it was written in september 2005 , and there has been at least 3 new beta releases of the framework since then . about 1/2 of the examples i have tried will not even compile , or have bad runtime errors . the `` big concepts '' are mostly unchanged . however , i can not recommend this book to anyone . programmer to programmer , you will be better off reading examples from online sources like msdn.microsoft.com and downloading new wpf tools like `` expression '' . this book will find you confused with broken examples fast . i look forward to an updated version when avalon solidifies
