2005 's most dishonest book i ca n't speak with authority about other deseg cases , but i am knowledgeable about the st. louis case , having spent four years on the st. louis board of education ( 1989 - 1993. ) . simply put , deseg has destroyed the st. louis public schools ( slpss ) , which were arguably , the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg , when they were segregated and run by white lutherans . today , after 26 years of deseg , the slpss are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of missouri . let 's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as kozol : costs deseg has cost the state of missouri about $ 8 billion between the kansas city and st. louis cases . the bill in k.c . totaled about $ 3.5 billion when it finally ended , while the st. louis case has almost certainly passed the $ 4 billion mark . ( these statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media . ) what have we realized from this expenditure ? first of all , state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in missouri not participating in a deseg case . small , rural school districts routinely spend between $ 4,000 and $ 5,500 per pupil each year . in st. louis , the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $ 11,711 : yet , those rural , so-called `` out-state '' districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students , despite having half the resources . ( i 'm sure in kozol 's mind they are merely `` goyim , '' and deserve no better ... ) ironically , while less affluent `` out-state '' districts were robbed of state funding by deseg , the wealthier school districts in st. louis county experienced a massive windfall from deseg : since they are reimbursed by the state the average per-pupil cost for each city transfer , ( rather than their `` marginal '' cost , ) wealthy districts such as clayton , ladue and parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues , although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other missouri district by a factor of three or more . ( for example , clayton currently spends about $ 15,000 per pupil per year . ) achievement in the slpss , half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests . this stat would be even worse , except that ( i am told ) the `` ld '' ( or `` learning disabled '' ) kids do not take the standardized tests . there are legions of ld kids ... in a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety , a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s . that study , called the `` lissitz study '' revealed that city students ( i.e. , black students ) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the slps . that is , they improved less than students in all-black , the `` naturally '' -integrated , and `` magnet '' schools . when the educational testing service still `` normed '' the sats between 400 and 1600 , the average slps student had a combined sat of 760 . worse yet , these were the best and most motivated students , with further educational aspirations , who `` self-selected '' themselves to take the sats and were therefore , a highly `` skewed '' sample relative to the average slps student . deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that , if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools , black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids . now that even william coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject , ( `` the coleman report , '' cited in `` brown v. board , '' ) kozol and deseg 's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of `` the bell curve '' in order to understand academic disparities between the races . vested interests it has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system . this is because the naacp legal defense fund is a `` co-plaintiff '' in most ( if not all ) u.s. deseg cases , and is periodically distributed `` legal expenses '' by the federal courts . these are a very important source of revenue to the naacp , which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades . similarly , deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around . one of the most injurious elements of the st. louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers . the slpss now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the n.b.a. , and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections . essentially , the same black women who , 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as `` domestic '' help , are now slps teachers and administrators . ( `` i is a teacher . '' ) how anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but kozol and deseg 's other defenders . if teachers and administrators in the slpss were required to take the s.a.t.s , more than half would test significantly below average : we know this because they have already demonstrated the fact ! approximately half of all slps teachers and about 60 % of its administrators attended harris-stowe state teacher 's college , which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of `` higher learning '' in missouri . last time i called their admissions office , i was told that harris-stowe accepted applicants with a combined sat of 780 . it should come as no surprise that recent measures of slps student sats do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers . hypocrisy a truly fascinating phenomenon i have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program . it does n't take a parent long to understand that deseg is n't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day , or your daughter gets beaten up because she wo n't date outside her race . now kozol may not have kids , but i 'll just bet that if he does , they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs , if any were available where he resides . ( the jews are mustard for this sort of thing , as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it does n't actually cost them anything ... ) i once had the rare opportunity to sit next to dr. susan uchitelle , the jewish woman who headed the st. louis deseg 's `` voluntary inter-district coordinating council '' throughout the 1980s and 1990s . ( she was paid $ 60,000 per year , but from what i could discern , her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media , so the rubes out there would n't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing , gun-shot incident , murder , or race riot . ) i considered it an `` opportunity '' because i was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before : `` have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program ? '' ( that is , were her kids , who would have been `` poster children '' for the county-to-city deseg program , allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools ? ) what do you think was the answer , oh gentle reader ? your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants , such as jonathan kozol ... ( i 'll give you a hint : susan uchitelle 's attitude toward deseg is very much like leona helmsley 's attitude toward taxes ... )
