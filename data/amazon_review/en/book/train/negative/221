too many cooks ( even if they are good ones ) spoil the broth this book pulls together a lot of information , but in my opinion it is written and organized very very poorly . i have over 10 yrs of experience in in the healthcare industry and came across this book during a grad level course in cea . long , boring , convoluted sentences fill the pages of this book . it took about 3 times more time and effort to get through a page in this book compared to a page in respected journals like jama , nejm , bmj etc . if you have lots of time and are doing research in this field - go for it . alternatively if you want to quickly determine what cea is about , i would recommend reading peter muennig and kamran khan `` designing and conducting cost-effectiveness analyses in medicine and health care ''
