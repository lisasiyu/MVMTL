tourist tramp what a disappointmet ! what i was hoping would be a useful tourbook full of interesting facts about world bathing cultures and history turned out to be a lurid expose of brue 's downward moral spiral -- her characters would be mortified to read passages that recount how she was `` not supposed to tell '' , how she rationalizes her infidelity ( poor , poor charles -- let 's hope you stopped paying the bills and rent and moved out ) . her superior attitude is unearned and unwarranted -- what gives this 27-year-old the right to lord herself over those with more experience and aptitude ? another reviewer compared brue 's writing to bill bryson . i have news for you -- bryson has a sense of wit and humor as he vivisects cultural ( and human ) anomalies . brue is just plain cruel and mean -- where 's the fun in that ( for the reader ) . shame on the editorial staff at bloomsbury for buying into a good concept ( it was a good concept ) and letting it go to seed . brue 's experiences are best left to the diary . instead of elevating bathing studies into the pop limelight , she sends it to the red-light district where she is infinitely more comfortable . and the net result -- she , her readers , and her contacts all suffer from bad research and bad writing in this self-serving piece of trash best left on the beach , buried and unread
