lifeless , dull and boring i could n't get past the first few tales . they left me feeling ... . nothing . reading the back of a cereal box would have been more exciting . i would definately not recommend this book . as a fan of earlene fowler and monica ferris . i thought i might enjoy & quot ; the cat who & quot ; series but if this book is any indication of the author 's writing , i 'll pass
