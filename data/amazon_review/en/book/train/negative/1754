not for the uninitiated i am currently taking an undergraduate course on cather , and i hoped that this book would provide some insight into a side of her not covered in the course . however , i found the book full of jargon which rendered it incomprehensible to me . perhaps if you are already initiated into the world of & quot ; queer studies & quot ; you will find it interesting , but i do n't recommend it for a casual reader
