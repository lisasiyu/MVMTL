threw it away the good first . there is a lot of good . i enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal . my husband and i have a great marriage . he knows i have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me . he is certainly not ever wanting more sex , just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes . ( in jest i 'm sure . ) i say that to show , that not coming from a prude , the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it 's normal . i am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice . it was dealt with like , it 's a fact so get used to it . your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look , or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night . the men give accounts of this , like , oh well , does n't mean i do n't love my wife . in my opinion , just b/c they are n't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts , does n't mean it 's ok . i found the book to be very very discouraging . that a bunch of married christian men would unapologetically ( key word here ) see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less ( we 're not talking lingerie here ) and think about what she 's like in bed or what her nipples look like . there 's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart . or maybe they should not do this . it really threw me for a loop ! i guess i did n't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are . not that i think they do n't want a lot of it . but i found it discouraging for christian wives to think that their husbands ca n't go to work without picturing everyone naked . i found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it 's `` normal '' and women just need to get used to the idea
