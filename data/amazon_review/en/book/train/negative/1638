what a disappointment ! this would never have been published as a first novel . i had read and loved earlier books by jeanne dams and was looking forward to reading this book . but the plot was almost nonexistent and the protagonist , young helda , unbelievable and not very likeable . you had to do more than suspend disbelief with this book , since everything about the book was so improbable
