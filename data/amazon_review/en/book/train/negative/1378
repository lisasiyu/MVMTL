not for the beginner . i went to the same school as the author of this book , and so it was used for my introductory cmos design class . the book has a lot of great material , but it was rather confusing to me as a beginner . now that i 'm a more seasoned designer , i can look back on this book as an excellent reference , but i still find the explanations somewhat confusing . it 's clear that the author is a foremost expert on the subject , but he just has some trouble relaying the fundamentals to the novice designer
