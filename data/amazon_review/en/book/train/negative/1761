not my cup of tea i know i 'll get criticized for not `` getting '' this book . i read many books of the entertainment industry having studied the red scare of the 50s , numerous autobiographies , stories of the business side of the biz , and other novels such as this . most of my novels have been of more recent history and i read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era . frankly , this bizarre underbelly of hollywood is off the charts . the one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period , the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today . do n't know why i did n't get it as this book is so highly recommended but be forewarned , it 's not for everyone .
