really bad book i do n't know who wrote the 5 star reviews of this book , but they 're like those actors in bad tv ads claiming that they lost 100 pounds in 8 weeks . those rave reviews are hard to stomach . this is a really bad book -- i agree with the person who said that they would give it zero stars if they could ( half the book is empty blank pages for your journaling ) . there is not much that 's helpful in this book . much better and thorough are ( 1 ) the thyroid solution by ridha arem , ( 2 ) living with autoimmune disease by mary j. shomon , & ( 3 ) thyroid power by richard l. shames and marilee halo shames . these books are better researched and are compassionately and well-written by m.d . 's and/or persons with personal experience with thyroid problems . skip this book by dirgo
