one case where the film was probably better this is a product of the lazy , latter-day leonard who knows he 's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow . the onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up . even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him . now everybody like , y'know , talks like , uhh , some kinda boob , get what i 'm sayin ' ? the line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages . he still has a hand with the quirky minor characters , though they ca n't carry an entire 350-page plus novel . but this one did make it clear to me why leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd : his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe , one with no values or standards whatsoever . here , e.g. , the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life , the friendly , easygoing loan shark . in your traditional crime novel -- chandler or either macdonald can serve as examples -- the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service . now i wo n't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play . but this was a case where i finished the thing , and kind of enjoyed the ride , but did n't like myself for it . in leonard 's recent novels , all that matters is who gets to take home the candy . and when you get right down to it , that just ai n't enough .
