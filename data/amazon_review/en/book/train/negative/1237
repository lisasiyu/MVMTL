uncle tom 's cabin - review by trish new a catalyst for the civil war , uncle tom 's cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves . the book 's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out , and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the african american 's pain , despite being redundant , rube and rife with tautology . the story is about tom , a slave who saves his master 's daughter and is promised his freedom . but his master dies before tom is actually freed . the family falls upon hard times and tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named simon legree . legree tried everything to degrade tom , but tom holds firmly to his religious convictions .
