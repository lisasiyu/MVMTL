these reviewers blindly regirgitate antiscience gibberish this book is garbage . tell me of one documented case of human ill-effects from gmo 's and maybe i will sway . recently the zambian gov't turned down 18000 tons of emergency grain from the us because it was gm . people died of starvation as a result . at least take the time to get the other side of the story before taking this book as the gospel truth . i respect nader for alot of the things he has done . this book is certainly not on that list
