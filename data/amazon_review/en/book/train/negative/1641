proceed with caution this book gives lots of chemical demonstration ideas . however , some are entirely too dangerous to do . you must use a lot of common sense when considering doing any of these demonstrations . some are not safe at all . mercury and ccl4 are epa regulated . it 's not advisable to put ethanol in your mouth to spit out in front of students ... this only demonstrates bad lab techniques . make sure you do the first experiment in the book outside or in a fume hood . it releases a strong odor and an acid vapor . definitely not something you want your students breathing
