horribly boring this book was so terribly boring that it made me come close to tears when knowing that i had to read this book for a project . there are no clif notes , spark notes , etc . for this book and there should be . do n't waste your time reading this book ! it has no twist , and i ca n't even imagine how there could be one , considering that it was the same boring historical detail over and over and over again . if you must read this book , i recommend some strong coffee and some valium
