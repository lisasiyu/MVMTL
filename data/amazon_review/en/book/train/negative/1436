lousy image resolution makes this product unusable although this electronic atlas has all the netter plates , and quite a few nice new ones , as well as some radiographic views , it is nearly unusable in practice . the images are scanned at such low resolution that many important details are simply not visible . the program can only display images at 640 x 480 x 256 colors , regardless of your monitor or video card ( it even says so right in the documentation ) . part of the horizontal resolution is used up by the navigation bar , so the actual plate image resolution is even lower than 640 . if you estimate a typical plate to be 10 & quot ; x 10 & quot ; , that works out to maybe 50 dpi . many of the smaller features on the original art can not be seen on tne electronic version , and often it is impossible to tell where the leader lines are going . the quality does not change when you print or zoom in . all the other bells and whistles , like the study lists , searching , etc . just do not make up for the fact that the image quality is absolutely awful . and the user interface is terribly archaic , nonstandard , and hard to use . the font for the lables is horrible . also , i 'm not sure i like the pronunciation of the speaking feature : & quot ; pec-tor-ay-lis major & quot ; ? if you have the cash to spare , it makes a nice toy , but it is not worth the price
