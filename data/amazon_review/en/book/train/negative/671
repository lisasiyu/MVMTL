total garbage ! this book is pretty near worthless . i started reading it knowing that i was unlikely to agree with much of vicki 's `` advice , '' but i thought it still might be funny . it was n't . also , lots of her advice is not only wrong it is *completely* wrong -- as in , not only not backed up by evidence , but actually *contraindicated* by evidence . i could not even finish reading the book after i got to the complete drivel that was her `` advice '' on infant feeding -- she presented the section as `` common considerations when deciding to breastfeed '' and then proceeded to describe the absolute worst-case-scenario for everything possibly related to breastfeeding ( & several things that ca n't be blamed on breastfeeding at all ! ) . it was a common considerations section , but would have been more aptly named , `` reasons i think breastfeeding is awful and no one should do it '' section . i think it is valuable for women to read books that present a less-than-rosy view of motherhood , because too often we have a strong and persistent `` perfect mother '' image in our heads that is very difficult to live up to ( especially if we have perfectionistic tendencies ) . i adore real-life , tell-it-like it is motherhood memoirs -- they are validating and supportive . this book , however , is overwhelming negative and baby-bashing . there are much , much better books out there that do not worship motherhood , but do not completely despise it either
