awful book , could have been written in 10 pages . do n't buy this one . this is just a bunch of blah blah blah written by a guy who does not master the english language , so he uses a lot of filler words just to pile up pages of useless information . not even the examples at the end of the book are well laid . he used some canned spreadsheet tables to fill in things like `` risky '' - `` medium risk '' - `` safe '' etc ... which is just a complete nonsense in forex . what really made me mad was the horrible way this book is written . this russian author could have phrased sentences using less than half of the words he used . it 's a no more than a 10 page book streched to more than a 100 pages of you know what . lame
