what the heck is this ? ? ? this little book is , in my opinion , a really poor attempt at humor and a huge disappointment to the wonderful bridget jones diaries . if you have read the bridget jones books , then this little book is unnecessary since it is just regurgitated material from her diaries . however , if you have not read the bridget jones diaries yet , i highly suggest you do that first since this little book might be a turn-off if you do n't know what you are dealing with ahead of time . this book contains silly pictures of how to shove things under your bed before company comes and how to call for domino 's delivery ... ( yes , there are pictures showing the reader how to dial the telephone , but it does n't stop there . we also get photographic details on how to open the box and put the pizza in our mouths ! ) if this kind of information could be useful to you then , by all means , get this book . however , if you are like most of us and already know how to dial a telephone , stick a slice of pizza in your mouth , shove things under your bed and step on a bathroom scale , then i suggest you save your ( money )
