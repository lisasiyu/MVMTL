very bad book - do n't buy if i purchased this book in 1995 when delphi came up i would be really satisfied . but when you have around & quot ; developers guide & quot ; and & quot ; mastering & quot ; books along with the list of other usefull ones , i consider that buying this book is just waste of your money
