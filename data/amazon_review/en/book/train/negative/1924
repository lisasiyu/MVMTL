i 'm trying to think of something good to say i ca n't find anything good to say about this book . i agree that it 's tedious , boring and a waste of money . i put it down and picked it up and then asked myself 'why ' , closed it up and put it up . i was going to sell it here but everyone else who tried to read it beat me to it . it 's not even worth the $ .01 .
