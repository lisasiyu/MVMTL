this text is only for advanced studies i strongly believe that this book could easily create misunderstandings to a student of harmony . i found this book almost chaotic when i studied it as a harmony sudent . in comparison to walter piston 's harmony this book has not a straight and organised method of teaching and i only recommend it for advanced students
