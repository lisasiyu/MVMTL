should have been a 20-page undergraduate paper i bought this book based on its 5-star rating and feel i wasted my money . that 's how i really feel , authentically . i have read other works positing a connection between physical symptoms/illnesses and life trauma ; the idea is not unique or new . alice miller is fixated on the idea that the fouth commandment ( honor thy parents ) has poisoned lives and ruined society and restates this theory every page or two . this notion is so compelling to her that she actually went to the vatican to complain . ms. miller gives anecdotal information about famous people who died young and then leaps to the conclusion that their parents were mean to them . maybe they were -- but what are we supposed to do with this information ? find a therapist who is willing to become emotionally involved with us seems to be the cure . this medicine carries its own risks . i 'm sorry alice was also raised by abusers ( which she confesses ) but getting tangled up in some codependent parent-figure therapeutic emotional incest with her or someone like her is not really going to help anybody . realizing what happened to you is important , and raging and grieving about it is important , but sooner or later you have to move on . forgiving is n't forgetting or letting the abuser off the hook -- it 's letting you off the hook , refusing to be owned by the past anymore . and yes , you can love and hate somebody at the same time . it gets down to knowing you ca n't get what you needed from them or any other person in your adult life ... you have to become the parent of the wounded child within and help that child finish growing up . good luck and god bless ... if you 're needing a book like this for yourself .
