magic christian lacks any real magic while guy grand 's pranks are amusing , the book lacks any real satirical center or dramatic structure , which would give it some meaning ( and some real bite ) . you could take the chapters out of their present sequence , reassemble them in any order , and the book would be just as effective -- - and that 's about as damning a criticism as i can think of . the book utlimately is a washout . it starts and stops in the same place , and in between the narrative just meanders from episode to episode without any real idea of what it wants to do , or how to do it . not southern 's best , by any means , but better than tripe like candy
