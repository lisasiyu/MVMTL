outright dangerous before you even consider buying this book , take a few seconds to try this instructive little exercise : type `` feed onions cats '' ( without the quotation marks ) into your browser 's search field , and see what comes up . onions are toxic to cats . cats are obligate carnivores , and many common plant compounds that humans ingest daily are actually poisonous to them . i wish that there were some way to get this book out of amazon.com 's database . many thanks to cat rescuer ( see below ) for being the first to spot this unbelievable incompetence and warn unsuspecting cat owners away from this `` cookbook '' . this review is largely a repetition of what cat rescuer has already said ; i just added this one on to knock a star of the book 's rating . please feel free to do the same
