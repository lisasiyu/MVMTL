awful book ! i would give this book less than one star if that were possible . after reading the reviews , i eagerly ordered `` trust '' and anticipated reading it . well ... .i read it and what a waste of time . stilted , unnatural dialogue and narration , a spoon-fed simplistic plot , robotic and one-dimensional characters , and clunky vocabulary usage made this book one of the worst i have read in many years . the sentences `` he stared into her eyes '' and `` he placed his hand on her shoulder '' appeared four times in the space of six pages ; then for good measure , the author throws them in several more times later in the book . there is no context given ; what do they imply -- a threat , a romantic interest ? the writing is consistently shallow and superficial and the author sums up and reviews the simple plot developments every two or three chapters as if the reader could n't possibly remember what is happening from one page to the next . in my case , perhaps that was true because the poor writing and puppet-like characters that behaved inconsistently were laughably distracting . i forced myself to finish the book and was just as bored and incredulous at the end as when i began . did the author self publish this book ? please , sir , go to writing school and get an editor
