the `` complete guide '' is not very complete notwithstanding the l. a . times describing this book as easy-to-use and informative , i found it close to useless . the basic problem is that it does not give information for any individual drugs - it gives info only for drug classes . as an example , i tried to get information on using cipro for travelers ' diarrhea . i had to look up cipro in the index , where i was referred to the fluoroquinolones section , which lists cipro along with 12 other wide-spectrum antibotics . there is no cipro-specific information regarding usage , dosage , or anything else . ( nor was there any mention of travelers ' diarrhea . ) since the information covers 13 distinct , although related , drugs , the information is necessarily very generalized . by way of contrast , the essential guide to prescription drugs 2006 , which i purchased at the same time , does provide descriptions for individual drugs , and it lists travelers ' diarrhea as one of the off-label uses for cipro . the pdr family guide also lists individual drugs
