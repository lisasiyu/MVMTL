so repetetive in print that it will drive your child to boredom i wanted to like this one . i really did . my son loves hand clap games and board books so it seemed like a natural fit . he just seemed to hate the repetition in this one . the sounds/words/rhythm are the same page in and page out and by page 5 , he was acting like he does when i try to read a book to him a second time to avoid getting up to get another . ( he 's seen it before and he knows it .
