nothing beautiful about it i had such high hopes for this book - nominated for all those prizes ! if you 're looking for gay fiction then this book is for you . it should be sold with the porn magazines - the first 100 pages ramble on and on about gay sex - but never get to a storyline . i tried to endure . i kept hoping there was a story ! i grew up in britain and thought this sounded like a great perspective on the iron lady ( prime minister margaret thatcher ) and 80 's britain . but it 's just about a guy trying to fit in with a bunch of snobbish upper class twits ! oh yes , and there 's lots of gay sex
