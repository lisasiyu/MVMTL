infuriating and disappointing ... i wanted to read this book as lighthearted summer fun . instead , i found a rather dreary tale of some seriously mixed up people . most infuriating was the character of tony , possibly the most arrogant , pompous , self-righteous ass who has ever graced modern literature . and the author condones him and his behavior ! he 's right , do n't you see ? he 's a macho guy , the omni present voice of reason and knowing what 's right for everyone . the other infuriating part of this novel is the author 's treatment of faye , the heroine . because she 's & quot ; fiesty , independent and outspoken & quot ; , she is repeatedly referred to as & quot ; difficult to handle & quot ; and & quot ; a real handful & quot ; . excuse me , but is ms. moore saying that women need to be & quot ; handled & quot ; ? apparently so , since we 're told that faye has really & quot ; met her match & quot ; in this tony loser . i think that a man with those same characteristics would be praised as a real go-getter , aggressive and accomplished . why the author has strong-willed faye succumb to tony 's blackmail and bullying is way beyond me . and the way the novel ended ? come on ! she has made the smart , strong willed man the hero ( though she tries to discuss his & quot ; faults & quot ; to make things appear even ) , and the woman very introspective and sorry for the way she is ... and trying ever so hard to change . if any man tried to bully and blackmail any smart woman into ruining her own wedding day , i 'm pretty sure she 'd tell him to shove it far , far up where the sun do n't shine - and i ca n't believe that faye did n't . a novel for the 21st century ? i do n't think so . if you love chick-lit , read the shopaholic books or the nanny diaries ; at least they 're well written and funny
