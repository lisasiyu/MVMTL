belaborment since many of the positives of this book were mentioned by other reviewers , i 'd like to point out a few of the book 's undesirable qualities . first off , belaboring the point . when i read a cookbook , each recipe does n't specify to sift the flour . that information is usually provided at the beginning and by inference is applied to all subsequent recipes . when i read time and time again that ed is n't using bottled oxygen , it starts to drive me nuts . yea i get it . you 're the man . you do n't use supplemental oxygen unless you 're a guide , so do n't keep reminding me . maybe this style of writing was to make the record absolutely clear , i do n't know . for myself , i would appreciate an author more if they had faith in the readers to remember one generality placed in the beginning of the book . secondly , was this book edited ? on page 278 ed says `` i 've always believed that you need to listen to the mountain and watch for the signs it 's giving you . '' then on page 282 , on the same ascent of annapurna , he says `` i 've always believed that the mountain tells you whether to go up , stay put , or go down . '' he just said this ! even an amateur copy editor would see this and recommend removal . maybe this really is n't a 2nd criticism just a corollary of the first . the negatives aside , the substory concerning the french hiker jean-christophe lafaille was excellent . and learning of ed 's early days in washington racing up rainier was pretty cool . ed 's candor concerning other hiker partners is somewhat interesting , if almost risque . i am thankful to mountain hardwear for providing this book for free ... ... i would recommend taking it out on loan from the library because its definitely not work taking up space in a book shelf ( there 's little 2nd read potential here )
