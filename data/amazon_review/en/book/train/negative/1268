hippy commune cooking when i bought this book i thought i was getting a simple living book about how to cook beans . i guess i should have read more about it in amazon , but it reminds me of 1960s hippy commune vegetarian cooking . not what i had in mind . a lot of soy , tofu , honey and all that . i wish someone would write a book about plain cooking that uses beans and meat
