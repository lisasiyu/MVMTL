will be a collector 's item some day i recently saw this book on the bargain bin . this book was pure garbage , by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits . basically they are saying valuations do n't matter . since they wrote the book , it has been prooven that their philosophy , approached over the long term , produces some great damaging losses . the book may be useful during the next bubble , which if history serves , will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky . to the dungeon with these two knaves
