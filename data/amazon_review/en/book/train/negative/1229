i do n't get ... . why prior books that are far better researched have the lifespan of milk , while goldberg who 's story is surely contrived , gets five star reviews . seems like working at the new yorker and washington post trumps ... danny rubenstein 's `` the people of nowhere '' amira hass ' `` drinking the sea at gaza '' and wendy orange ' `` coming home to jerusalem '' ... and many others who were deeply engaged journalists drop off the book list . surely these now out of print books covered the same turf but none are connected to goldberg 's . why ? is it all about connections and pr ? i think yes . what do you think ?
