disappointing i 've read all of iris johansen 's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them -- this , however was not one of them . i found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book . what mysterious event happened to jock and royd ? who is macduff -- well if you have n't read the previous novel , you 'll never know
