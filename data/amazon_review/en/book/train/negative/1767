21 days to write it and 1 second to reach the bin ! it simply did n't work for me.if you are beginner , you need more than this little book.the screenwriter bible by david trottier is the one.do not expect to write any good stories in 21 days.stop dreaming and start writing.this book is kind of hard to read so if it 's for beginner , it is just done to to make your learning more difficult than anything else . forget it and follow my advice above
