very disappointing i hate this book . all the book is the repetition of the same code with very , very few differences . the description lets argue that is pointed to advanced users but the content is so basic that is hard to believe . it uses soap in it 's more basic fashion . the code is poor ( also the html and the javascript used ) . the code is written in a so invesive fashion that if you strip it ( and is not a bad idea ) , you will find no more than 30 pages . the multi-tier is just supposed to be good and misuesed . as you may understand , i strongly advise to not buy this book
