pretentious and boring despite what the tag line promises , this is not an epic story of ww ii 's most dramatic mission . it is ridicuous to even suggest such a thing . at best this is a superficial recounting of a late war mission which turned out not to be not nearly as dangerous as it could have been . the bravery of the men who took part in the raid can not be questioned . however , there are countless other tales of ww ii that recount much more horrificly dangerous events than the one depicted here . the book simply fails to deliver . if you are looking for a gripping tale of the horror and heroism that defined ww ii this is not the one
