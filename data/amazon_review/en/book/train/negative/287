lame detective the premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years , whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him , appears to be alive after all . the problem is that sue grafton 's fictional detective kinsey millhone is too incompetent to solve the case . how does she resolve her dilemma ? by asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy ms. milhone 's curiosity . lame ! and then there is this subplot into ms. millhone 's personal life that leads to nowhere . i do n't know what `` k '' or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers , but i 'm not interested in finding out
