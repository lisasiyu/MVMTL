doors that go nowhere initially , i was excited to pick up a collection of short stories by straub . but , this has got to be my least favorite of all of straub 's work . every story seems disjointed an incomplete . i never got a full sense of what happened by the time i finished each story . i kept reading the book , however , in hopes of finding a gem . i came close with & quot ; mrs. god & quot ; , but again felt let down on the outcome . each story is too much buildup and not enough delivery . i was glad to finish this book and put it back on the shelf . despite the positive reviews , i was not impressed
