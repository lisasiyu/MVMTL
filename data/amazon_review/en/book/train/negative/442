emotions , soul , and heart combine to make a person whole . this is a continuation of the mind of the soul by this pair and the seat of the soul by mr. zukav . he has published three others about the soul , yet he is not a psychologist or specialist in this field . this is an extremely simplified textbook which found its way to the library sale . the bold-faced `` highlighted '' parts throughout are distracting . from some of the diagams , these ideas : `` the early antidote for painful emotions is love and trust '' ( combined ) , `` you continually encounter what your soul wants you to encounter . when you resist your encounters , you resist the purpose of your life , the beneficience of the universe , non-physical assistance . that resistance is your pain , '' and `` stress is your indication you are resisting your experience in the present moment . when you resist your emotions , you create stress . '' your emotions are the force field of your soul . each emotion is a message for you , a signal from your soul . when you are aware of everything you are feeling all the time ( emotional awareness ) , you are in continual communication with your soul . this book is a lot of wishful thinking . they are a good-looking couple , but hardly qualified to influence educated persons about how to handle emotions or reach deep down to find one 's soul . that is a spiritual thing
