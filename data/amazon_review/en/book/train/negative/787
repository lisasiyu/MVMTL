morally repugnant for 54 years there was no seperation fence or 'apartheid wall ' built by israel to stop the human assaults of suicide bombers . but this is the cover of this book and points to what is really going on here . the argument is simple , had zionism not existed there would be no arab-israeli conflict . had israel created a palestinian state , that he jordanians refused to from 1948-1967 , there would have been peace . the entire onus for any conflict in the middle east rests with israel . this is an interesting argument . israel is unique in being one of the few states created by an ideology , rather than an ideology rising out of a nation ( rather zionism rose out of the jewish nation , but not in its present borders ) . however it is not the only example . the risorgimento in italy is responsible for odern italy and in a number of other pleace latent ideologies have done the same , creating nations out of loose federations . after all modern moldova has little historical merit and neither does kosovo . for that matter most of the borders of the arab states also arise out of modern ideology , especially the borders of modern turkey . only apparently in israel is this a problem . the reason is remarkably simple , only in israel did the creation of the new state result in 50 yeas of warfare . other 'old ' conflicts like that over kashmir are likely a result of the same . but we do not readily argue that the existence of india is responsible for the kashmir conflict . it would be hard to imagine the title of an book about another nation being 'the case against .. ' for instance 'the case against germany ' . therein lis the illogic of this book . a case can not be made against the existence of a state . there can be no 'case against japan ' . even if all the arguments are correct , the solution , the disappearence of israel as a state , is not only genocidal in its intentions but illogical in its premise . seth j. frantzan
