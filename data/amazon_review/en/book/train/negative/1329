a very dull read it goes like this ... hero muses , is followed , takes a meeting , phones , travels , phones , takes a meeting , travels , phones , takes a meeting , phones , travels , takes a meeting , etc , etc . if this is what makes for a good novel , it 's all yours . i do n't care if this is how they do it in real life in the cia , it 's damn dull reading . the real mystery with this novel is why it ever got good reviews
