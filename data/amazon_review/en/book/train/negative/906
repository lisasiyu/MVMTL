a little disappointing finders keepers , by linnea sinclair is another scifi/romance . it 's an action/adventure story with plenty of romance , but set in a science fiction setting . captain elliot and her c-3po-type droid , named dezi , find a marooned and unconscious man on a desolate planet . but the rescued man , rhis , is n't who he claims to be . and captain elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery . elliot seems to trust rhis even though he has lied to her , simply because she 's attracted to him . the technical jargon is a bit much , as are sinclair 's made up words and language . this book might have been easier to read ( and not as corny ) , if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many `` z 's '' and `` v 's . '' on the other hand , her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking . there was an alien species , but i have no idea what they looked like . and no one else , other than the two main characters , was described in any detail either . besides my criticisms , there was a good story underneath , though the ending seemed a bit abrupt
