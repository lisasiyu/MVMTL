a deceiving title this sounds like an ideal book for a person with an eating disorder . but it heaps loads of guilt and condemnation on an already needy and suffering soul . the idea that over or undereating is sin is one concept . but the fact is that the individuals embroiled in this can not help themselves . they are already people pleasers and perfectionists , how can telling them the whole problem is because they are sinners be of help ? they are already as good as they can get themselves to be . they are not bad -- they are hurt and afraid . it has been said no one can overcome an eating disorder without the help of a therapist . this i believe . there are too many important issues involved in this disease to dismiss it as sin . if the person knew the issues they would be a long way to getting help . god loves these dear ones and understands the enormity of their situation and their pain . these are very good people . heaping more condemnation on one beset with self-loathing is surely not the path to freedom . adding god 's displeasure to this already mountainous pile of self hate can only be damaging -- perhaps pushing some over the edge . a good book to avoid ! !
