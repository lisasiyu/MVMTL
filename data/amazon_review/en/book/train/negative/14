do not buy this book words can not describe how ripped off and disappointed i feel about buying this book . having read rdpd and cfq in the kiyosaki range previously and finding them great , i thought this book would be great as well . i 'm sorry to say it 's the worst book i 've ever read . the entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books . there 's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more , you need to buy one of his other books . i did n't get any useful information and it 's certainly not a 'how to ' book . i thought i would be reading about him and his wife 's story but all i got was the same few points said over and over again . he does n't even try to say them in a different way . the other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option . it was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members . i could seriously go on and on about why you should n't waste your money on this book but i wo n't . i have never written a book review on amazon before as i have never felt so strongly about a book . i generally feel if i get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it . in this case i did n't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why i decided to post this review . i hope it saves someone else from wasting their money . buying this book will not help you retire young or retire rich
