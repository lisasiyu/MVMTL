who believes this ? this novel is absolute dreck , at the best . i do n't think i could ever pick up another grisham novel without vomiting . pelican brief was okay . but , i honestly can not read him again , because of this . the reason for this one star rating is this . first , the protaganist is a stupid punk kid , who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or something ! second , 496 pages filled with `` blah blah blah '' there was n't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel . maybe one hundred , and then it would have been decent . third , when reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved , you would at least expect more blood-shed , or more death . especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things . fourth , although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place . speech and the written word , are signs of intelligence , vulgarity is something people use when they do n't know how to convey something accurately . honestly every page has at least some . now you know , that unless you want your socks bored off , you should n't even look in the section that has grisham in it . if you want to read something light , that 's believable , not fantasy and not romance , read crichton .
