the book was as empty as the chair . new york criminalist , lincoln rhyme , is in north carolina to undergo surgery which he hopes will improve his quadriplegia . a sheriff from the small town of tanners corner asks for his help . a teenaged boy has been murdered and two young women kidnapped by a youth known as insect boy . rhyme , along with his protagee ' and soul mate amelia sachs and his aide thom , agree to help . this is the first book by deaver i 've read and , while i am hoping it was just a bad choice , i 'm not certain i 'll read another . i really struggled to get through it . i had no history of the principal characters and none was given . in fact , all the characters were one dimensional , there were two many of them and stereotypes ran rampant . i like a good twist or two in a story but this became laughable . and let 's not even talk about the ending ! i did feel deaver did a very good job conveying the problems and frustrations of a quadriplegic , but that was the only redeeming feature . as for the plot , the title says it all . this rated zero on the believability scale .
