teach your children about & quot ; ugliness & quot ; a to z has a big problem in my opinion . it is a very simple children 's book with some very cute illustrations of animals ( a to z ) . each animal is engaged in an action that also begins with the first letter of it 's name ( e.g . kangaroos kissing ) . there are lots of made up animals , i 'm assuming to account for the rarity of animals beginning with & quot ; q & quot ; and & quot ; x & quot ; etc . the part that i do n't like is the fictitious & quot ; uglybirds & quot ; whose action is simply & quot ; being ugly & quot ; . the illustration that goes along with this so-called ugliness is very disturbing . the & quot ; uglybirds & quot ; have atypical bird features that seem intentional . they are green and purple , and have messed up feathers and big bulging eyes and are very & quot ; different & quot ; from the & quot ; normal & quot ; birds in this and other books . upon reading this , my wife and i agreed that we would never repeat this section while reading to our daughter . although i do intend on teaching my daughter about ugliness ( racism , violence , contempt , etc. ) . i think that it is a quality that should n't be used to describe physical appearance . when my daughter encounters a person who is physically unusual , i hope that i have instilled in her the values to disregard what others might find & quot ; ugly & quot ; . i know that some might think that i 'm overanalyzing such an innocent entry in a child 's book , i think that parents need to be more careful about the messages that they are sending about ugliness
