sexy years for who ? some of this book is good and normally i love suzanne summers but ... . a few comments like `` no wonder men leave us for younger woman '' . like what is that about ? woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy . does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging ? when i ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off . woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first . i just felt the book was a push for the s principle book and to be hot for your guy . usually her stuff is good but i was n't crazy about this one . sorry nothing new in this book . maybe helpful to someone else . jud
