author sneaks in biblical misinterpretation , poor editing . i got this as both a book and an audio file . i had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author , but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts ( e.g. , i gasped when he suggested christ went to hell ... what bible passage evidences this ? ) . i agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep ... but wonder if i go further how much more eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations . where were his editors when this was being written ? why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities ? i havent read all the reviews here but as one of those `` conservatives '' frequently mentioned in them i have to admit i may not even finish this book for fear of what else eldredge has slipped up on . i did appreciate his story about daniel and the `` delayed '' angel ... but am left wondering if i need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too . what a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me . we are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the bible well . so far ... i may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize christians and return to the word itself . i wonder if i can get a refund
