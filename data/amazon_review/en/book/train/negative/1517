unwaiveringly biased and unbalanced throughout this book mr. shulman denigrates the contribution of the wright brothers . his bias is so prevalent throughout the book that i found myself shaking my head as i read blatantly contradictory statements within 5 lines of each other . the author 's opinions and accusations are either based on his limited research or his intentional omission of fact . if you 're even considering buying this book , i would direct you to the author 's own words following a completely inane paragraph of conjecture about orville wright ... ... ... ... & quot ; or perhaps not. & quot ; that about sums up this biased inaccurate ploy concealed in the history section
