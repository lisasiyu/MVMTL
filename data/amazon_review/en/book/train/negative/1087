not even close i am married to a marine officer who is currently deployed to iraq for the second time . as you can imagine , most of our friends are also marine families . additionally , my mother-in-law was a marine wife for 35 years . this book is not representative of myself , my mother-in-law , or of any military spouse either of us know . do not look to this book for an accurate impression of military life . i do n't want to slam ms smiley . she is entitled to her own life experiences . however , they are not typical `` military spouse '' experiences ( far from it ) so i am writing this review to make sure potential readers are n't duped into thinking this will give insight into the military life . it does n't , and it wo n't . the spouses i know are the anti-smiley . the spouses i know are educated , capable , strong , witty , caring , giving , women . the spouses i know would never behave this cowardly toward their military service member or be this careless with their marriages . i shudder to think that readers would think that she represents me , or any other spouse i know . do not buy this book if you want to learn real , interesting things about the military . read `` making the corps '' instead . do not read this book if you like inspired , compelling story-lines . regardless of the military angle , the story is weak and the writing is bad . am i qualified to judge a good book ? maybe . i read about 25 books a year and i am fairly well aquainted with the best seller lists . in the end , though , it 's all about your personal taste . read this book if you like non-best-seller-list chic lit
