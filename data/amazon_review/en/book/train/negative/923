the one book i was told to read and actually did ... ... and was n't it awful . slow , nonsensical , not to mention boring ... . basically , it 's about a poor guy who finds a black pearl . and then bad stuff happens . that is all the book is about . no sub-plot , no nothing . to be honest , the best bit was when the main character 's baby gets shot and dies . the book ( about 70 pages long , to be honest i ca n't remember . i do n't want to remember ) is really slow to start with , and stays that way until the last 10 pages where a million things happen at once . it is way too descriptive , and nothing remotely interesting happens . and then it just ends . it was really empty . i have read other `` classics '' such as war of the worlds , animal farm , lord of the flies , etc , all of which had more substance and staying power than this .
