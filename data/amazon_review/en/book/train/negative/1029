does n't bother with context the author like so many others lumped all christian denominations and seeminingly monotheistic religions together as one . no , not all christians are the same . furthermore , the author took many verses in the bible out of context , rather than choosing to see it as a whole , he instead sees it in pieces , as being contradictory , not bothering to take seriously why the bible made certain statements
