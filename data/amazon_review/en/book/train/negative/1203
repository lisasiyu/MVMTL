junie b. jones collection : books 17-20 i gave this only one star as i did n't actually read it . i thought i was ordering books for my grand-daughter , but it turned out to be audio tapes . i paid over $ 12 . for it , but was only refunded $ 7 . extra fees were added that were n't there when i purchased . i wrote to amazon about not wanting a refund , but wanting the actual books , i got no response . i will never order from amazon again , i am very disappointed with the way this was handled
