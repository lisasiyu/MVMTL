audio version is a bomb when purchasing audiobooks , i normally follow a simple but very effective rule : never , never , never buy an audiobook read by the author . even if the author is a talented writer , he/she is invariably a terrible narrator . always look for audiobooks performed by experienced readers , as in bryson 's own `` notes from a small island '' and `` a walk in the woods '' , read by ron mclarty . in bryson 's case i made a rare exception when i listened to `` in a sunburned country '' - the audio version had received reasonable reviews and his performance was indeed adequately entertaining . for this reason i assumed that `` neither here nor there '' would be equally enjoyable . i was wrong . bryson 's deadpan monologue makes it sound as though he was bored out of his mind while reading this book . passages that may have seemed amusing in the written version are herein delivered in a sleep-inducing monotone . the sardonically comedic talent he displayed in his reading of `` in a sunburned country '' is totally lacking . i would recommend this audiobook only as a cure for insomnia
