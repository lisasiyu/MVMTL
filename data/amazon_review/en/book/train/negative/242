very disappointed ! i have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery . i thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light ' plots . there are serious themes here - murder , death , kidnapping , and others . too bad the authors did n't focus more on the light plotlines that reader 's look for in these books - maggie 's romance ( this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer ) and the jamie / max story ( which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline ) . i also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her .
