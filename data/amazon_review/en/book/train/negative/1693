are you easily amused ? if you 're easily amused by anything that hyperactively draws attention to its & quot ; cool & quot ; sensibility , this book is for you . stacey richter obviously went to one too many writer 's workshops where they pat each other on the back for their inside-ness and forget what real literature can be . none of her characters reveal any depth or texture . what little thematic substance the stories have is as fuzzy as a fly-away wisp of pink cotton candy . instead , what you get is exaggerated , absurd sequences rooted in cultural fetishes and fantasies of abnormality or violence . richter lacks the discipline or patience to build a real-life scenario ; she wants to take shortcuts by way of cultural references , precious oddity , and patronizing first-person narration . incidents tumble forward like an upturned toychest of kitschy knick-knacks collected and lovingly polished , then laid out on a tacky folding table for you to fawn over and call art . the word that best describes the whole thing is & quot ; shallow. & quot ; it 's as if richter were writing moment-to-moment , giggling over her cleverness , probably sipping an orbitz because it 's & quot ; so stupid , it 's sublime. & quot ; after smart people start seeing through this one-trick literary con job ( i 'm looking down at my watch ) , perhaps richter can get lucky and land a gig writing pop-up windows for blind date
