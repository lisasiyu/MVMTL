not what was presented while the history of roger bacon was interesting and the other historic figures ( aristotle , soccrates , etal ) i was expecting more about the actual manuscript and how it was deciphered and those around that quest . instead the book spends over 2/3s relating stories of how various famous figures interacted , political climates and philosophies . this is nice background but it could have been shortened , in this reader 's humble opinion . if you want to know more about the manuscript , look to another book .
