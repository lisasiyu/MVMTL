nothing new and bad photos i agree with the above review ; minimal information , absolutely horrible photos and rather crummy quality paper makes this book not worth buying . meadmore selected many chairs that are discussed much more completely in other similar books . he missed a few key chairs of note ; saarinen 's grasshopper chair and aalto 's armchair 400 ( zebra or tank ) chair . if you want a good welll rounded selection of modern chairs , i 'd suggest the 1000 chairs book instead
