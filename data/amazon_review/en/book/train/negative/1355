not happy i ordered this book twice , especially because the picture shows the book with a blue cover which is the cambridge press edition.the books i received were not from canbridge press and did not have the appendix iii which is the genealogy . these books came from paperbackshop in england . i feel that the genealogy is a very important part of this book and should always be included .
