not a developer book i will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers , this is not a developer book , by far . it also has a lot of repetition in it . you can explain the different security groups twice , but 5 times seems like a little too much ... the fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me , because that is what i am looking for in a book . how to use sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help
