phillips capm is obsolete do not buy this book unless you are being retested on the old pmp or capm exam . this book is based on the 2nd edition ( 2000 ) of the pmbok and is therefore obsolete . the current exams use the 3rd edition ( 2004 ) of the pmbok . much has changed so this book will mislead you and you will answer exams questions incorrectly . the processes , process groups , some definition have changed . as a result , many of his test questions will be wrong also . i am a pmp and i teach pmp and capm test prep sessions
