there has to be a better guide out there after seeing the five-star review for a previous edition of this book i was eager to buy it for my recent trip to mexico city . sadly , it fell far short of my expectations . for starters , the maps are woefully inadequate . there are n't enough of them , they lack sufficient detail , and there is no number and letter grid system . that last problem is inexcusable and made it nearly impossible to find many of the sights mentioned in the book . the overall organization of the book is also not done well and does not seem very logical . making matters worse , the book is not bound well and actually started to lose pages before my relatively short trip even ended . i have had far better books than this when i have visited other parts of the world . i have to think someone makes a better mexico city guide too
