do n't buy this book ! if you 're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-do n't pick up this edition . it is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of verne 's story and mistranslating much of the remainder . its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering tor 's status as a leading science fiction publisher , and the company 's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning . if you want to truly get to know verne 's novel , pick up the elegant naval institute press edition , in a modern , complete , updated translation , with commentary by the leading american verne expert today , walter james miller . that book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original french first edition ( no illustrations are to be found in the b & n mercier reprint ) . less attractive but more academic is the oxford classics version of twenty thousand leagues . this review is posted on behalf of the north american jules verne society by jean-michel margot , president najvs
