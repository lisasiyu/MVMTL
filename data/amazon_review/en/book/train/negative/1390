yawn this is said to be one of nadine gordimer 's finest works , and she is a nobel prize winner , so i hoped for great things when i picked this one out at the bookstore , unfortunately assuming that the nobel prize would be a guarantee that i would love it . well , i did n't love it . while indeed a competent storytelling , i do n't really regard this as literature . there is not the fire , imagination or creativity one expects , nor the sophistication that should elevate such a work above its peers . i managed to get to the end , but i ca n't say that i felt or learned anything at all . it makes me wonder if there were political , rather than literary reasons that caused the nobel comittee to honor this author .
