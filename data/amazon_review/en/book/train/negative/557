do yourself a favor and stop after chapter 3 the first chapter will pique your interest . the next two chapters will present interesting examples of emergent behavior . the remainder of the book will likely leave you feeling frustrated at the poor presentation and disappointed at the lack of follow-through on your expectations from chapter 1 . the density of useful information drops precipitously as the book progresses , degrading to something at or below what you would expect to read in a blog ( i 'm serious ) . i must admit i have n't been able to finish the last chapter
