a poor read and flawed history this book is somewhat entertaining , but it could 've used an editor . unfotunately , it not only lacks a great deal of facts , but it often gives the opposite . the author frequently falls into tired , false cliche about his opinions of the era , which often contradicts his more factual claims , and speaks about it 's figures as if he had known then inside and out , and disliked them . the ridiculous mark twain-esque cliches he claims as facts are enough to drop the book , making it just another in the 100 year long pile of falsified , biased histories of the middle ages
