did n't care what happened to the main characters i bought this book so i 'd have something interesting to read during my son 's tonsillectomy last fall . i was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it ! i got half-way through the book , and it bothered me so much ( my own issues getting in the way ? ) , i put the book away . i felt anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter , molly , while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with leo . i did n't like any of the main characters , including molly -- -all too unrealistic . but i picked up the book yesterday and finished it . the book was too flat ! though i do n't think she was a bad mom , she certainly exercised poor judgment ( and for what ? like leo was a good catch ? ) ! i wasted my time ( i do n't read books very often ) on this story . yet i did read the whole book , hoping it would get better , so i 'm giving it 2 stars . i did n't think i 'd get any more of sue miller 's books , but other reviewers said she has better novels
