dreadful plot , nice dialogue this is meant to be a mystery , but one can deduce the entire plot in almost the first couple of chapters . then it gets boring waiting and waiting for the rest of the characters to stumble over it ! a couple of the sub-plot characters ( regina & lucy especially ) are nothing more than boring caricatures . i was very disappointed in the whole satan worshiping mumbo jumbo mystery - does n't seem like something jane austen would need to prop up her books . that said , the dialogue and general writing is great . i really enjoyed the first half of the book that centered on kitty and harry 's courtship . i really wish there had n't been all the aforementioned mumbo jumbo and instead bebris had concentrated her obvious talents on the excitement of normal life
