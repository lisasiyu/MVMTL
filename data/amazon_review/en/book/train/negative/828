red storm never gets off the ground i 'll repeat what surprisingly only a few people have mentioned so far . unless you 're an expert in military lingo and with the different types of military hardware you 're going to find yourself lost and disinterested . the first few chapters were actually quite good and laid the groundwork for what i thought would be a good story . the remaining chapters had little connection to this however . the book ended up being nothing more than endless military talk , little character development , tedious descriptions of military and submarine encounters . even clancy 's much maligned red rabbit is far superior to this
