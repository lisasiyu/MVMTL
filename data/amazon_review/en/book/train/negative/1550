do n't let this book be your introduction to dash mysteries.. this reviewer is grateful that this book was not her first dash mystery , because it would have been her last . ms. benjamin is too talented a writer to be judged on the basis of what one can only hope is a major and temporary lapse in judgment . if you 're looking to try her work , go straight to her first book . in this book , rachel alexander comes off as not very likeable : wearing the victim 's clothes and jewelry , sleeping with the victim 's boyfriend , trying to live the victim 's life ... .all of this has rachel coming across as a rather sick voyeuristic woman ... in fact , her treatment of the victim 's boyfriend makes her a rather cruel and callous one . this reviewer does not understand the purpose behind having the victim 's dog witness the crime or how the dog even figures into the plot at all . and not enough dash in this book ! dash is but a secondary decoration in this book ... and rachel even goes out into a dangerous situation in the dead of night , and leaves him behind ! ! ! the only good things i can say about the book is the writing style is good and you will be kept guessing as to what happened in the victim 's last moment until the book 's end ; the problem is that by that point , you 'll not care if rachel herself winds up sharing the victim 's fate . ms. benjamin is a better writer than this ; her character needs rehabilitation after this book ... ..the readership deserves more dash and less trash ... ..this reviewer 's advice : only resort to this dash mystery when you 've read all of the others ... ..
