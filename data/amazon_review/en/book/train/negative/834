political correctness gone amok . if your teaching a class on feminist political correctness this is the book for you . this book provides lots of racial , ethnic , geographic and sexual identity diversity , but its pretty thin on the great book part . the overwhelming majority of the 500 books are from the 20th century and yet there is not one reference to gina berriault that i could find . perhaps her political credentials were not good enough ; all she can do is write great fiction . if you really want to read a great book written by a woman , then read the lights of earth , or women in their beds by gina berriault
