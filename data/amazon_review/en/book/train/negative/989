great topic - terrible presenation well , i just had to try another dr. phil book , since it has been a number of years since i read life strategies . to be honest , even though he can be a polarizing figure , i have nothing against him . i think his tv is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people . this book however , was a real struggle to complete . it was not coherently structured , and the author kept saying things like `` this book will show you ... . '' all the way through the book . it felt like i never left the `` introduction '' and he was continually trying to convince me ( or himself ) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound . instead it really could n't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader 's attention . fret not ! there are other books out there that tackle the same general issue , but are far better reads . i recommend : 1 . failing forward , by john c. maxwell 2 . today matters , by john c. maxwell again , i have no issue with the author , and applaud his efforts . however , in writing a review to my fellow amazon customers , i must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre . best of success to you in reaching your goals
