well dressed and mannerful men do n't do very well this book is well written by a woman who would know a lot about advances and pick ups . however , her book really only scratches the surface of learning to date out of your league . yes she tells you how to dress , yes she tells you how to eat properly , and yes she even tells you how to be a vip ( all very interesting and good tips by the way ) but what made this book unhelpful was the lack of content . you can not only tell a man to dress well and act wealthy but you must give him content ! tell him what to say ! tell him what to do ! tell him what wo n't work ! the author goes in depth into each sign of interest a woman can show , but if a man can not even be interesting in conversation why would a woman ever show interest ? if your looking for a book to tell you how to dress like sean connery and become a vip at your local restuarant then buy this book . but if your looking for a book that will teach you how to talk to woman , tell funny stories , and get them interested in you i recommend you look elsewhere
