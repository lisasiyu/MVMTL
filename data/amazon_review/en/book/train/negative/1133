fluff book with no practical advice this book uses a lot of buzz words and offers very little substantial advice when it comes to actually designing your own house . it touches a little on straw bale and reused materials and barely grazes cob/clay/rammed earth . it does n't even mention geodesic domes as far as i can tell . the book advocates on one page ( p.72 ) that people should live in small humble buildings , only having the square footage they absolutely need . then a few pages later ( p.79 ) it shows a 4000+ sq . ft. home , with the title `` an excersize in efficiency . '' i fail to see anything efficeint about a 4000 sq . ft. home , especially when it 's a standard a-frame building ( granted , it 's for a family of 6 , but then again there 's nothing `` green '' about having 4 children ) . it does cover some good stuff like gray-water use , rain collection , alternative heating and cooling , but it glosses over all of this and takes up a lot of space with strange-angled shots of rooms and floor plans . i know the floor plan i want , and there 's very little that a floor plan has to do with green building ( it 's more about orientation to the sun for passive solar use ) . what i 'd prefer to have seen was simple diagrams of how the systems of the house work . there 's a spot that explains how one house has the pool hooked up to the ac such that the hot exhaust from the ac heats the pool . now that 's something i can get into , but i want more than a couple sentences about it . that deserves a diagram
