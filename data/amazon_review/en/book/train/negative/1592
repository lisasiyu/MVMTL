the emperor has no clothes this book may be written about a fascinating literary figure at an interesting time in our history , with a potentially atmospheric setting and an intriguing mystery to boot -- but it all adds up to nothing when the prose is so bad . i listened to about half this book on tape , but found i just could not bear another minute of it . it was stilted , repetitive , and trite . the language used in dialog and at moments of high drama was just plain embarrassing . some suggest that the author was trying to emulate the way people spoke in the 19th c , but i do n't believe anyone in history would 've been this ponderous or repetitive in everyday speech ; if so , such conversations are best forgotten . i love mysteries and historical fiction , but have read boilerplate novels in these genres which are far less agonizing and more entertaining to read .
