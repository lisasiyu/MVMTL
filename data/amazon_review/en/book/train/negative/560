only connect ? our entire book club disliked this book . we had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters . howard , the largest presence in this story , feels like a blank at the core . upon putting this book down , his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me . characters such as jerome , victoria , and carl were intriguingly introduced , but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text . especially carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all . as am homage to howard 's end , some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me . for example , the heart-to-heart connection between kiki belsey and carlene kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between margaret schlegel and mrs. wilcox did . i thought zora was one of the most interesting characters , and i like how smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity . but smith makes her smug a bit too often , and so feeling a connection with zora is difficult as well - most of the time i just wanted to smack her . and i have to agree with the others that smith needs to brush up on her american characterizations . there was next to no authenticity in that regard . especially the southern dialogue - laughable ! it also feels like smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book ... i understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts ... but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling , unresolved , by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness . aaaargh ... must go and re-read howard 's end to dispell the queasy feeling left by on beauty
