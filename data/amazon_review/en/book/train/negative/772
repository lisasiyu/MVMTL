dangerous misinformation suzanne somers apparently has no use for modern medical science . especially as a survivor of breast cancer ( although of a very early stage ) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones . recent studies have shown that women who were taking hrt for protection from heart problems actually had more problems than normal menopausal women . this is an unbelievably destructive , horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously . being skinny is not more important than being alive . if you want to get the real scoop on hormones , talk to a doctor at an academic medical center ( in other words , one that is n't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain ) and see what she or he has to say . chances are excellent that you 'll be told to avoid them at all cost . look at it this way : are you going to put your very life in the hands of suzanne somers ? i 'm sure she 's a very nice person ; it 's just that she has no medical training whatsoever . *** writing from an nci-designated comprehensive cancer center**
