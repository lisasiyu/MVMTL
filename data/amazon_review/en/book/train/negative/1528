ammie , go away ! this book is so bad i do n't even know where to start . i bought it based on many of the reviews on this page , and since i had previously read the master of blacktower and loved it , i thought that this book would be similarly good . i was terribly wrong ! right away the dialogue ticked me off because real people do n't talk the way that the characters talk in this book . the dialogue ( mainly involving macdougal and bruce ) is filled with pompous remarks and ridiculous attempts to sound intelligent . it is so forced that it makes you want to cringe ( when they start arguing about christian theory and the middle ages while sara is passed out on the floor from demonic possession , you know that you should just stop reading now ) . it is like in one of those bad tv movies where , when something terrible happens , all of the characters stand around and say `` i wonder what we 'll do ? '' i can not believe how bad this is . the possession/seance thing is completely hokey anyway . do n't waste your time with this one . i could n't even finish it .
