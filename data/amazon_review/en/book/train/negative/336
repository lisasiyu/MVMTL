too long , too unorganized for all the hype this book has received i am pretty disappointed . i found this book to be written in a very non-engaging style , making it difficult to just follow what the author was saying . additionally it 's absolutely terribly organized . what kind of programming book spends the first couple of chapters talking about programs that use and implement classes , and then finally halfway through the book actually tells you what a class is and how to make one . it 's absolutely unusable as a reference , and just barely useable as a means of learning c++ . c++ is a very large and complicated programming language , and therefore books on it should do their best to be as helpful and organized as possible . if programming languages were books , c++ would be `` c++ primer '' , poorly thought out , unorganized , and unnecessarily complicated
