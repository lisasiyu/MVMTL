neither thrilling , nor chilling . i 'm scared to death of aliens , and i love nothing more than a good campfire tale , so i was so excited when i found this book . i expected it to be a collection of great , creepy , true-sounding stories , kind of like urban legends , that you could tell to a group of friends to keep them up at night . boy , was i wrong . it 's just a collection of short stories about aliens . most of them are more sci-fi like than scary . i was expecting stories of the traditional `` alien encounter '' type , but that 's not what 's in here . they 're not horribly written , just not really what the book promises . the shape of the book is great , though . it 's got a sturdy cover , and it 's made sort of like a field guide . if it did contain creepy tales to tell around the campfire , it would be perfect to stuff in your backpack . too bad .
