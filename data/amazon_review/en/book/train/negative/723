just very odd ... ... this story should have and could have been really good . it presents a great concept , but the story is just so poorly crafted . it is very sexist , the prose is stiff , and the plot is dull . i will concede that it was interesting at times ; it kept me reading , but i really did n't get much out of it . i can only praise heinlein for including the `` intelligent conversation '' which takes place after the press conference , where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn . the whole story is just very odd . do read it though . it 's a title to read if you wish to be considered `` well read . '' despite its faults , valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten , just as we will never forget atticus from `` to kill a mockingbird . ''
