truthiness is n't good enough this was given to me by a religious friend who thought i might be able to find some value in christianity in borg 's `` new paradigm . '' what borg 's book amounts to is that borg admits that christianity is not historically or factually true , but he thinks the `` truthiness '' of christianity ( to borrow stephen colbert 's term ) is good enough . by treating christianity and concepts like being `` born again '' as metaphors , he tries to escape the problem of having to defend the actual truth of christianity . as a christian apologist , he gives away the store , but then claims it 's worthwhile to come into the empty store because it will give you a warm feeling . for christians who do n't really believe in christianity , but want to rationalize why they attend church , this might be what they need to hear . but i do n't think many people who do n't see the point of christianity to begin with will be convinced . for me , you should either be rational in deciding what you believe or admit that you 're being irrational in your religious beliefs and are just going by your gut anyway . this kind of half-way house between the two just does n't do anything for me
