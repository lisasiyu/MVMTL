pure shlock i generally do n't enjoy reading books with teenaged legs and sunflowers on the cover . i often read on the subway , and it can be a bit embarassing . if i chose to weather the pornographic implications of such cover art , i expect to be rewarded for my sacrifice -- with , say -- a good book . i 'd even settle for full characters who change and grow . i 'd settle for dialogue that occasionally rose above tediousness and pointlessness -- perhaps dialogue that , in fact , advanced the plot or advanced character development . if i am going to sit on the l train with a book that slightly resembles a baby-sitters club epic , i would like for that book to be enriching/rewarding/entertaining/redeeming . why is this book 400 pages long ? ? ! ! ! ! nothing happens . the family has the same conversations over and over again , and nothing ever changes , and the father character is so irresponsibly designed that his dialogue is virtually identical to that of her 31-year-old boyfriend , oliver . no one comes alive , except maybe the mother . i found almost nothing to hold on to in the entire novel . the opening line was intriguing . from there on out , it becomes progressively worse . i felt only for one person : the mother . because she sat in the background , hands folded meekly , kind of depressed and annoyed , for the entire book . which was a lot like how rr made me feel , too
