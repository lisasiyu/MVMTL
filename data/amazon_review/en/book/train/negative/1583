a difficult read if you just want the meat maybe this book contains some good advice . but i gave it a low rating because you have to wade through so much fluff to find it . i seriously doubt i 'll make it all the way through the book . the first part of the book talks about michael gerber 's ( fictitious ? ) mentee sarah , a previous client of his who has apparently fallen and ca n't get up . the conversations between michael and sarah are so contrived and syrupy , who can believe them ? sarah needs to climb a mountain in nepal , discover the meaning of life , and get it over with . the second part , which i 'm reading now , is structured around the 7 `` disciplines '' for building a company . i skipped ahead to this part , but it refers back to so much of the fluff in the first part that i really feel lost not having read it . if you like business story books of the patrick lencioni variety , you might get something out of e myth mastery . but be warned : this book as many times longer than lencioni 's , with a lot less meat
