somewhat dull and unsatisfying somewhat dull and unsatisfying , like some other `` literary '' works i 've read which do n't hole my interest , do n't resolve problems , swimming endlessly in the inner thoughts of a person with no action or only references to previous actions . i enjoyed his 'they came like swallows ' because it was very satisfying , but this is too `` literary '' for me in the sense that it appears to be more about the writer 's writing ability than the actual story .
