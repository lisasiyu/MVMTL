disappointed nothing new in this book and cd does not add to the value of this purchase . i purchased the book and cd combination in hopes of having experiential exercises . exercises are provided , yet the author merely explains these on the cd versus guiding one through a meditation . it feels as if he is merely reading the directions for the exercises and the exercises are not new or imaginative . if one is new to self help books on healing trauma or anxiety , this may be the book for you . i 've read and heard authors and psychologists talk about the flight and fight response over 20 years ago . i , personally , have found more healing/success in spiritual books , guided meditations or intense physical exercise where my heart rate increases or in strength training .
