outdated -- -ancient history exiled cubans in miami up to 1987 . this is real old stuff . i wonder why this book is still being published . felt like a collection of shorter magazine -- newspaper articles compiled to look like a real book . many long , disjointed sentences . could use an updating . there must be better books out there about this topic
