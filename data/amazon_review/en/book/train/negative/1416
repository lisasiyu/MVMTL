well written , elegiac , but slow , and ultimately boring yes , jordan writes well , uses words and descriptions beautifully . one of the many glowing blurbs on the dust jacket described it as `` elegiac '' and it certainly is , but elegiac only takes a book so far . beyond that , you need interesting characters that the reader cares about , set in a story that moves with a compelling narrative . perfect example , atonement . sadly , shade joins the pile of books i put down after wading through more than 100 pages . i could not finish it even though i was trapped on a long airplane flight with nothing else to read
