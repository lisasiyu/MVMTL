peter smith hardcover warning ! ! ! if you 're considering buying the peter smith `` edition '' of this book , note that it is not a new `` edition '' in hardcover but the vintage international edition rebound in red cloth , with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front . it looks like it 's been rebound for libraries , is the type of thing that 's usually not for sale to the general public ( . . . ) the book is well-rebound , and may still be worth it to you cormac mccarthy diehards out there -- it is for me , and ultimately i 'm just gon na keep the copy of it i bought , but it 's still quite disappointing . thought you deserved a warning , hope it came in time . mccarthy 's a great writer , of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star , but it 's an issue of the edition , not the book
