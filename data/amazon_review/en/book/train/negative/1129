pringle 's picks i wish this book had been titled , science fiction : my favorite 100 novels . i can see what authors mr. pringle likes ( dick , heinlein , moorcock , to name a few ) and what his taste in sci-fi is and can even probably determine his age , but objectively speaking ( if i am in fact , being objective ) i think a lot of novels that should have been in the top 100 were left off off his list . of course we all have our opinions of what the best science fiction is , and if you like science fiction that usually means you love it and therefore probably have strong opinions , so if you find you share his tastes then this is the 100 for you . i did get a few suggestions from it so it was somewhat helpful .
