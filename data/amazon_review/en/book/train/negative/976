a work for academic readers only this book reads like a phd dissertation and focuses on making reference after reference to dozens of other academic articles and books , much like a college research paper . i wonder if these 5 star reviews are from sociology professors because this is very dry reading and i ca n't imagine a casual reader being interested in reading this book at all
