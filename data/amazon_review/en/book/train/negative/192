danielle give me a break my husband has a theory that danielle steel has a dart board and each circle surrounding the center is labeled either , falls in love , loses family member , has death of loved-one , fights for life of herself or loved one , loses partner , business or spouse . he feels when she is at a loss she justs throws off a dart and whatever she hits becomes the outline for her next book . i have been a loyal fan for many many years and take his kidding with a smile and secretly pray he 's not right . this book proved me wrong and he was right all these years . it was so obvious from the first few pages what was happening that i was certain i had read this story before somewhere . after having waited long time to get this book from my local library i was so disappointed that it was so poorly written and so badly not thought through i could n't even read it completely , but skipped sections to finish it , knowing what was going to happen before i got to it .
