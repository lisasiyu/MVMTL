i officially hate this book ! i , also , must second mark twain . this book is a waste of time ! why do teachers make us read it when we should be reading tolkien , gk chesterton , cs lewis , and the like ? agh . then , that could just be my wacky taste in novels ... but this was bad . oh my gosh ! ! ! the descriptions were always needlessly long , the conversations always needlessly long , the ... blah , blah , blah , blah . that 's what the whole thing was . blah . the whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short 200 pg novel and it would have been a million times better ! maybe even good ! and i like long books ! this book is terrible . listen to the warning of a fellow voracious reader and do not waste your time !
