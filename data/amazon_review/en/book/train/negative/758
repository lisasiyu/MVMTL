inane and annoying when traveling , i always try to take location appropriate literature along . this seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to venice . long after returning from the vacation , i 'm still trying to force myself to finish this book . it is self-indulgent and inane . if the use of the phrase `` do n't be rough , '' ( i could never figure out what was rough ) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire , then abundant use of `` i love you , whatever that means , '' should do it . i usually like hemingway , this book is awful
