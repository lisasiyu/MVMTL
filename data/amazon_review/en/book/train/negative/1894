good ... but lacking . an incomplete edition . while this story is truly an essential writing of dostoevsky , it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy . if you are interested in reading `` the grand inquisitor '' without reading the rest of the brothers karamazov , i would recommend the guignon edition , sold for only a little more . this work includes the two chapters preceeding `` the grand inquisitor '' as well as what dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale , `` the russian monk , '' which follows this legend . dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole , but i think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy . additionally , this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by charles guignon , which is much more informative than the brief one by anne fremantle provided in this copy . it is important to remember that `` the grand inquistor '' was not dostoevsky 's final answer in the brothers karamazov . reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both dostoevsky 's writing and philosophy and the brothers karamazov . i would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [ and i particularly recommend the pevear and volokhonsky translation for that : it is much more accurate to the original russian ] . or at a minimum , reading the other edition of this book . either way , you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of dostoevsky , which this fails to provide . the grand inquisitor is truly an essential read , but not in this presentation of it
