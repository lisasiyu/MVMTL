too much at once i too had to purchase this book for a class . it did not help . there is too much information compacted into one paragraph . then it is very reduntant . each chapter seems to be repeating itself even though it is suppose to be on another subject of philosophy . i would not suggest this book to anyone . it was a good thing i had prior knowledge of philosophy so i could pass my class . if you know nothing of philosophy , this book will only confuse you more
