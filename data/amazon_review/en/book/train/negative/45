do n't bother with this one life is too short to be spent reading drivel . stuart woods was really off the mark with this book . you should n't rest on your laurels mr. woods , your audience deserves better . i 've enjoyed your past books very much , but this one left a lot to be desired . i was very put off by stone barrington 's bed-hopping activities in this story . with arrington ( mother of his son ) one night , then with holly the next , i do n't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books . the plot was relly silly and contrived , it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story , never mind quality . do n't waste your money on this one
