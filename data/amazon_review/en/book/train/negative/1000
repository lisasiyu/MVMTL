excellent book marred by slander as many reviewers have commented , prof. lopez does an excellent job deconstructing the many fantasies westerners entertain about tibet . i was very dismayed , however , by his sneering dismissal of the work of trungpa rinpoche and sogyal rinpoche , who he declares are not & quot ; real tibetans & quot ; because they dared to try to present a difficult terma text in a manner that they believed would resonate with westerners . while trunpa rinpoche did often present the dharma in psychological terms , he consistently affirmed the conventional tibetan understanding of the six realms and other teachings . surely prof. lopez is aware of the years of vigorous traditional monastic training rinpoche underwent as a tulku in pre-invasion tibet , as a result of which he received both the khenpo degree in religious and mundane studies and the kyorpon degree in astrology . for prof. lopez to think that he is in a position to weigh in on the validity of the teaching choices made by these two lamas strikes me as quite arrogant and presumptuous
