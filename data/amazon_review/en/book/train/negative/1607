why on earth would you want a bible commentary from morris ? henry morris is neither a scientist nor a theologian . he 's a hydraulics engineer-turned-author who 's obsessively promoted the 7th day adventist doctrine of a `` young earth creation '' far outside the sda denomination - doing nearly incalcuable damage to many churches . he 's since gone on to promote the `` king james only '' cult group which further seeks to spread 7th day adventist false doctrines among baptist fundamentalists , and even promoted a sort of astrology among christians ! jesus said we 'll know them by their fruits - morris ' fruit is churches ripped apart over the age of the earth , and seekers convinced that the bible is n't true because of morris ' bizarre interpretation of genesis . morris deserves nothing but a firm , unsympathetic rebuke for distorting the bible , slandering other christians ... and lying about science
