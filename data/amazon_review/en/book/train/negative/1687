and i always thought dummies books were for complete beginners ... caveat emptor to the absolute beginner . this book is not written for the beginning web page creator . it is not written in a tutorial style . it is good as a reference source as you study a true tutorial type book . it discusses tags and their attributes one at a time without showing you how they fit into your web page code . the beginning chapters throw lots of advanced features at you and tell you they will be discussed in chapter 19 etc . i was completely overwhelmed after 20 min of reading . so what 's a beginner to do ? i recommend create your first web page in a weekend . by the time you get half way through that book then you can use this dummies book as a reference . william
