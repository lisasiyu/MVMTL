waste of time & money the book is full of useless fillings . finding your colors is limited to few hair and eye color combinations . it also depends on you doing a test with different colored fabrics & determing how the color reflect against your skin . after reading the book , i still do n't know what my colors are . besides , with so many different color hues on the market , how can one tell if what you 're buying is an ever green or true green for example , confusing . the lack of pictures showing the types of collars they 're recommending for different body types ( e.g mandarin collar , cowl , bardot ... ) ... is annoying , to say the least . questionnaires are poorly structured , & the section on makeup , underwear & accessories is trivial . save your money ( i 'm glad the book i read was a borrow from the library ) and save your time . pass
