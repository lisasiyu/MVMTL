just plain dumb ... when i saw this in the library , i guess i was expecting another version of the nanny diaries , which was cute . this `` novel , '' however , was poorly written and jumped all over the place ; there were no smooth transitions at all . it was basically one big promo of her company -- any time she mentioned a `` horror story '' she was quick to add that it was n't one of her nannies . basically , i thought it was boring and that the writing style emulated that of the 3rd graders i teach . it took me about an hour to read , after which i thought , `` how did that get published ? '' if you want to read a nanny book , try the nanny diaries . this book is stupid .
