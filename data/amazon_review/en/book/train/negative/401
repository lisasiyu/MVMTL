an extremely poor attemt at a spy/thriller i had to force myself to finish this book . i do n't allow myself to move onto a new read until i 've finished the one that i 've started , and this by far was the most difficult to get through . the dialogue between characters is laughable , the promising plot points are either too rushed or go on for far too long thereby destroying any bit of excitement that could be felt from them . ted bell 's description and background on these characters makes them too unbelievable either by allowing them every positive characteristic ( alex hawke ) or changing their characteristics when its convenient ( bin wazir ) . there is nothing endearing about this novel , i honestly can not believe this book was ever a bestseller . do yourself a favor , bypass this book and read the 007 series by ian fleming .
