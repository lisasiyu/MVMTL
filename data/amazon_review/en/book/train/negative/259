drinking or fishing ? i have enjoyed reading other books by mr. prosek , however , this one was a true disappointment . i could n't figure out if this was a book about fishing or drinking . there seemed to be more anecdotes regarding drinking and getting soused than any fishing action . even if the author loves to drink , the book is supposed to be about fishing the 41st parallel and all that that should entail . i may not have learned much about trout fishing , but i sure know where to find booze joints along the 41st parallel
