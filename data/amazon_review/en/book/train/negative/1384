a slippery , shoddy , and dishonest book this is one of the very worst books on law and legal theory i have ever read . the authors deliberately confuse important issues , libel those with whom they disagree , and string together a series of logical fallacies in order to reach a set of conclusions they favor for other reasons . readers who waste their time on this book will learn nothing of law and -- strikingly -- less than nothing of legal philosophy
