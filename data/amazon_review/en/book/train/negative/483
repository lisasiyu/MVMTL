i was repulsed by his refusal to chastise his pedophile companion ! i was enjoying the travel parts of the book , despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by mr. crichton , until i reached the part where he was in bangkok . he teams up with a journalist for a night on the town . his journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area 's many brothels . finally , after testing the waters , the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and suggests a child whorehouse . crichton does n't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him . instead , he goes and checks the place out . he gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes . perhaps i 'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile . i did n't expect crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex was n't his thing , instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him . this infuriated me and turned my stomach . i threw the book in the trash . i wish publishers had done the same . fyi , there is no zero star option
