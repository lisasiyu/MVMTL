save your time ! save your money ! if there was something less than a `` one star rating '' this book would qualify ! just a terrible collection of short stories going nowhere . very dis-jointed . very wordy . i kept reading to the end , in hopes of finding some kind of conclusion . the only conclusion found is to share the bad experience , in hopes of saving others from some pain and frustration ! i 'll never read peter straub again ! ugh
