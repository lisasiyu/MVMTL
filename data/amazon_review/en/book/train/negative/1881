could we now please have the version she meant to print ? this may be a bit of spoiler but i was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy . i could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then i learned . i felt i was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed . after three books i had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines . to wrap them up so hasty , with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books .
