abner kneeland to prove america is a christian nation david barton cites the little known blasphemy conviction of abner kneeland . during the 1830s kneeland , a former universalist turned pantheist , was sentenced to sixty days in a boston jail for ridiculing the deity of christ . barton cites commonwealth v. abner kneeland as example of how early american jurisprudence defended christianity . either david barton is a sloppy scholar or he is a man with a scary agenda . does barton believe that state governments should have the power to jail people for stating religious opinions contrary to his ? why else would he cite the kneeland case ? kneeland should only be a curious anachronism , not a legal precedent .
