love for a lifetime : building a marriage that will go the distance i found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written , but also insidiously demeaning to women . rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships , the author focused on the weakness and instability of women . in addition , his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised ... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage . i found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes . my fiancee and i have read chapman 's five love languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise
