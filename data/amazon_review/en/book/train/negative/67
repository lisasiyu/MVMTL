1 cent book provides 3 cents worth of laughs ... the only problem is even though it 's only a penny you 'd still have to pay $ 2- $ 3 shipping . not worth it ! funny book written by a sweaty little fat kid with crazy christian conservative parents . hearing a 14 year old virgin boy 's opinion on abortion is great . and it 's all yours for only one penny
