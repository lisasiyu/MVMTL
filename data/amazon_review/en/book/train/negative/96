not a good enough reference to be worth the money this is a tremendously expensive reference that one should expect to be trustworthy . but it is n't . nor is it as definitive as should be expected , though it does have some fascinating entries , such as the role of dogs in the history of food . for the price , there should be line drawings for some of the more unusual fruits and veg , because as it is , the verbal descriptions would lead a reader to think that something looked quite different than it does . so i use these two volumes with caution , referencing further anything said here before i take it as a given . although some other reviewers here have criticized the dryness of style , that is what i want in this sort of thing , so i have no complaints there . of far more importance is the slant that many of the articles have , which clearly have a political agenda that the information is wrapped around . so , while the bibliographies for same are useful , they also are selectively chosen . given the guides to food now , and the many histories , i would think that a few books judiciously chosen are better value than this one reference , though if you are monied , this is an interesting addition to your library , to be read with a grain of salt in every 'oh , my ! i did n't know that .
