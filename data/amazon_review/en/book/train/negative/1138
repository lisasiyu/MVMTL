ok , but missing a lot of info ! overall this book was ok . nothing special about it . i am a cleaning business owner and noticed that the book was flawed . i would like the author to please show me where a person can get 1 million dollars worth of insurance for $ 250- $ 400 as the book states . most people can not even get insured for that amount in any state until they have been in business for 3 years . the author left out a lot of information and i would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about starting a cleaning business . the only thing decent in the book is the appendix , but even that is not detailed enough . i give it two stars for effort and because i am a nice person
