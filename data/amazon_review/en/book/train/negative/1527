daughter loves it , but cleaning up is a nightmare ! the puzzles are great and a lot of fun for my two-year old . she loves anything 'princessy ' so the princesses were a big selling point . however , after she did each puzzle a couple of times , the pieces did n't stay in the book . when we 'd flip the page , all the pieces from that page would fall out . we ended up taking all the pieces out and putting them in a container , which is not the point of the book at all ! at least the backs of the pieces are colored specifically for one puzzle in the book , and my daughter gets practice at sorting her colors for half an hour before we can play with her puzzles .
