people will believe anything it seems okay , maybe i am greatly missing something , and someone can inform me of where they are , but i could n't find most the guys sources . there were numbers beside certain facts , but i looked into the back of the book , and everything , and found no connection with the numbers listing where the fact originated . i went to the index , and what was listed as recources , but they had no connection with the numbers which were listed besides the facts in which he put forth . when i read a book which is suppose to expose new information to me , i would expect there to be an extensive list of sources so that i can look up the information and the people in which he obtained the information from . what i found in the resources section were links to papers i should read which all contain biased info which were mainly on why you should eat vegan . i do n't deny that the guy truly believes what he is doing is right , and that he is truly trying to help people , but the fact that i ca n't find sources bothers me . anyways , this guy talks about how great it will be to live long -- personally , i could give a crap ... .last thing i want to be is freaking 50yrs old , but that is just my opinion . i do n't get what the point of him writing numbers beside facts was if he is n't going to back those numbers up with source information . read at your own risk . there is always the chance that i obtained a copy which left out this information , or that i am just missing it , but until i see a source list on his information , and am able to see completely the studies he includes , which talk about people living longer , being healthier , etc , then i ca n't fully believe him
