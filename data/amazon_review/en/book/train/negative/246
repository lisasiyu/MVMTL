how i spent my vacation there are two ways i can describe this book : as an assigned essay on & quot ; how i spent my vacation , & quot ; in which it might receive a passing grade in high school ; or as a visit by your brother-in-law , the one you never really liked but tolerated for your sister 's sake , who shares his superficial ideas as if they were deep insights . i suppose there are people who will voluntarily submit to either , but i 'm not one of them . the author ( he can only be called a writer in the most literal sense ) has no insight to speak of , is manifestly incompetent at background research , and lacks any useful power of description . he really should look up the meanings of words like & quot ; masquerade & quot ; and & quot ; circumvent & quot ; before he uses them . . . the real mystery is how something like this ever gets published
