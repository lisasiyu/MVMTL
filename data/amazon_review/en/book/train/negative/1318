disappointing : ( i enjoyed the movie claire of the moon , but when i read the book i found it to be a bit sophomoric . i am not a fan of `` cookie cutter '' type novels and she walks in beauty would definately fall into that catagory in my opinion . even if i had mounds of free time i would not spend much of it on this book , it 's an extreme let down .
