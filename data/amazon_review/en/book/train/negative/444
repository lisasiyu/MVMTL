fiddling with the classics as an old bostonian and cape codder i bought this book for the sumptious cover photograph . sadly ms broder suffers from the common cookbook author disease of clever fiddling with classic recipes . new england boiled dinner with stout , brown sugar and molasses ! made a sickly sweet mess . and my favorite , fried clams , made with japanese panko crumbs ! you get the idea . photos are great though
