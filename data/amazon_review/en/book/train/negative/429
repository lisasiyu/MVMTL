sad hello to all those who have read this book . after reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something . why are you so set against god and christianity ? one of you said this book was what made him rejest christianity . christianity is not some weird religion , it is the faith that jesus christ died for all humans , who he loves so much . where are you going after you die ? christ is waiting for you to call to him and ask for eternal life . the bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down , it is god inspired . there are more manuscripts and texts to prove the bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it . there are more manuscripts than that of homer 's the odyssey , yet we regard that as true . so the gospels werent written right after the disciples were with jesus , but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with christ . i am going to wrap it up now , but if you want to hear the real truth , read god 's word . if you do n't believe that , there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the bible . the age of reason was written by a man who hated christianity . please do not just accept his writing without looking at the bible . jesus christ loves you , and he longs for you to accept him so he can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with him . thank you
