bearly a quality book i have read many of anna pigeon books . this is my least favorite . the mystery is not developed and thought about which nevada barr usually does well . this was more of a book on bear/human relationship and a mystery ( small ) thrown in . i did not enjoy it like and it was more of a chore to read it . i highly suggest superior death or endagered species . these two are nevada barr 's best books
