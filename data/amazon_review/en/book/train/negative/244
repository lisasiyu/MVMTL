underwhelmed i 've heard al lee speak before and thought that what he had to say was sensible . however , although i basically agree with his approach , i just can not recommend his book . i found it to be too simplistic and to contain too much filler . there are many much better real estate investment books out there . some specific complaints : * the margins are ridiculously wide ; this book is much smaller than it seems . * some of the appendixes ( especially appendix a ) contained too much filler . * much of the book is a painfully detailed description of fields in a spreadsheet . this sort of documentation should be directly in the spreadsheet ( where it will be in sync with the latest version of the spreadsheet , etc ... rather than in a book . ) * when i heard al speak in person he emphasized new homes and owning property in remote locations if needed ( eg , owning property in dallas even if one does not live there ) . the book did not really touch on either of these topics . that said , i did find a couple parts of this books to be useful or interesting . these are : * the chapter on financial statements was useful ; in particular the ways that items for a rental property ( like rents due , funds in lender held escrow accounts , property taxes due , etc ... ) show up on the statements was interesting . * the tip that you can begin advertising a property for rent before you have closed on it . * the tip that you can try to time your lease expiration dates to be during times when school is out . * the recommendation that you work with a property manager who is willing to / capable of helping you find properties to purchase
