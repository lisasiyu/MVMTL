i ca n't believe someone published this . 6 volume series ? he man could have easily compressed this into 400 pages , but he 's so long winded with everything . and reading this feels like i 'm standing at the front door with jehova 's witnesses . ender 's game was great . it deserves 5 stars . but i 'm almost convinced it was written by someone else
