preposterous ! this book begins with the absurd claim that 'the natural numbers -1 , 2,3 , 4 etc- appear to have been present at the birth of the universe ; part and parcel of the original material from which was knit the ever-expanding continuum of space-time . ' the author does not explain in whose mind these numbers are supposed to have appeared or how a concept can be present without a mind to concieve it . like many mathematicians he seems unable to grasp that mathematics is a language . thus it 's not uncommon to hear ridiculous statements like 'the universe is governed by mathematics ' as if numbers exert forces . but this is the first time i 've encountered the claim that numbers existed prior to life !
