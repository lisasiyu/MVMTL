a high school writing effort i have read and enjoyed james patterson in the past , but can honestly say that this will be the last patterson book i will read . i was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability . the book had no depth , and the story suffered for it . as i read the book i got the impression that mr. patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible , and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting . i did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable .
