put this bride back on the shelf i loved the original book & quot ; the sherbrooke bride & quot ; . i have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse . the only reason i have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters . otherwise , this book is a complete waste of time . if you want to be thoroughly entertained i suggest reading the first book which happens to be about alex and douglass . skip the second for ryder 's story is so-so . i would then read sinjun 's search for love . it is very funny and captivating . ms. coulter generally writes really good books . she should have quit while she was ahead
