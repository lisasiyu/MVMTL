close , but not quite i was looking for a book that had legends about orphans to which i might relate . this book only has 4 or 5 stories and i had already heard them in some form . i also thought there might be some therapeutic or life management benefit in listening to this book . however , the author merely lists the `` gifts '' ( personality tendencies ) and describes the emotions of abandoned children , but does little by way of giving ideas for healing oneself or dealing with the ongoing relationships between our relatives and others . the content and gentle delivery might be helpful to those still grieving or those still trying to put their feelings into words ; but , it does little for listeners at the next level seeking solutions or strategies
