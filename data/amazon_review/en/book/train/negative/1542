please stop repeating yourself okay , maybe i am the odd ball , but this author drove me crazy ! he should have made a pamplet instead of a book . i felt as though it was written by a amway sales person . to me , the book read like they were trying to motivate you to go ahead and build your house . i needed factual information , and i got 90 % & quot ; you can do it & quot ; and 10 % & quot ; this is the stuff you need & quot ; . if you are two years away from building , you might like it , but i was two weeks away and already had most of the information provided . i am sending mine back
