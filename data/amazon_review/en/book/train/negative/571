racist classist megalomaniac talks a little about heroin after hearing some decent things about this book , i was surprised at just how uninteresting and often offensive of a read it turned out to be . marlowe is accurate in some of her depictions of heroin use in the east village of new york and way off base in others . i chalk this up to everyone 's experiences being different ( however , i certainly do n't think a one-bag-a-day habit with weeks off in between makes her an authority on addiction by any stretch of the imagination ) . what i do n't understand is why she felt the need to go into such great detail about her rather boring life between her discussions of the dope world . most of her anecdotes had little to no bearing on the story she was trying to tell and were mind-numbingly dull . i found her narrative to be very disjointed and incoherent . but what i found most repugnant was her better-than-thou attitude towards those of a lower class or darker skin tone ( e.g . assuming dark-skinned men who did n't think to aspire to become more than security guards must not have gotten support or affirmation in their homes growing up , like she did ) . she herself says that she became interested in street-life and street people in order to increase her `` coolness '' factor . sure she dabbled in drug use and in the east village culture , but that does not make her an authority , and she does not paint a very true portrait of either . if you want a good portrayal of street life and heroin use from the inside , read seth morgan 's homeboy . if you want elitist drivel , this book should do the trick
