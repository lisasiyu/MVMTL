disappointed i am a huge fan of the first quilts from the quiltmaker 's gift publication . i loved the book and have made three quilts that were inspired from the patterns found there . this sequel , more quilts from the quiltmaker 's gift is inferior on nearly every level . the patterns are not so interesting , and seem more fussy and complex . in addition , in this sequel publication , the patterns are not rated by level of difficulty , which i believe is a detriment . finally , the actual quality of the book is not good . within a day of bringing it home from the store , the cover of the book had curled up like a wood shaving ! i think the authors would have done well to stick with the same publisher who put out their first effort . about the only good things i can say about the book is that the instructions seem clear and the photos of other color options are helpful
