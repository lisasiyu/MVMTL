writer is a cad i expected this book to be fun take on the hollywood nanny experience where the reader can peek at the `` other side '' and perhaps try to guess who might be the real people behind the pseudonyms . nope . susanne hansen is a cad who betrays her former employers ( and her nanny friends ' employers ) by exposing their private family dynamics for entertainment and ridicule . it would have been much , much better had she changed names and focused more on the celebrity lifestyle gossipy end of it than in her own boring self-examinations and snotty judgements . in every page she obsesses over wealth and then condemns the very people whose assets she admires . she seems to think that shallow and neglectful parenting is something only to be found in the nanny-hiring set . there was no joy in reading this book once i realized that while she may have changed the children 's names , the names of the parents were quite real . it puts the lie to how much she felt for her charges that she would so humiliate their parents in pursuit of the almighty dollar
