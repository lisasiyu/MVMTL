at least one 5-star review is an author the turgid , confused prose is a dead give away . so is the overblown praise for this poorly written book . the 5 star review from & quot ; the united states of america & quot ; has to be one of the authors . if so , then the call for & quot ; objective & quot ; reviews from a postmodernist is ironic , as well as amusing . also ironic is the book 's theme of exploitation -- -by relying on a dated , superficial review of scholarly research , as well as sleazy pop culture , the book itself appears to be a work of western exploitation . except this time , it 's the arrogant academics exploiting prostitutes , rather than their male customers . this harsh , intensely narcisistic diatribe may be good vita fodder , but it is not worthwhile reading
