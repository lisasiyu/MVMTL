fake memoir this story was probably constructed from a number of real memoirs , other sources like films , and jung 's and the author 's imagination . helmut jung may have been a soldier on the eastern front but what he claims to have seen there owes more to imagination - perhaps the author 's - than reality . units composed of seven foot mongols ? ( p. 297 ) . really . in the fifty or so books i have read about the german-russian war nobody else noticed such units . in the same chapter , a description of the capture of a group of female russian soldiers appears to have been lifted from the film version of 'cross of iron ' . there are numerous other elements traceable to other sources throughout ths ridiculous book . avoid wasting money on this 'memoir ' . you will learn nothing about the real experience of combatants on the eastern front that you have n't already read elsewhere .
