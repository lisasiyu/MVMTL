extremely disappointing . although claiming to be a study of human-animal relationships , this book offers an endless recital of man 's inhumanity to man , to support the book 's theme that man 's history with animals has been even worse . very poorly thought out and extremely long-winded , this book reads like an overblown usenet message -- & quot ; those other people are all so horrible , but we animal lovers are ok , are n't we ? & quot ; oddly , serpell seems so rooted in the very & quot ; human supremacist & quot ; philosophy that he rails against , that he ends up reinforcing that very philosophy . not enlightening at all ; i feel like a pall has been cast over my relationships with both people and animals . you would learn far more by taking the money and time you might waste on this book , and spending them on your own dog or cat or whatever animal you please
