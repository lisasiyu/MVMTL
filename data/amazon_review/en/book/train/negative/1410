not worth it i was expecting a well composed novel and ended up with a story instead . have you ever been stuck on the telephone with a friend who insisted on reporting a personal story in a rambled manner while you have better things to do with your time ? or better yet , just get completely bored with the whole thing and hang up as quickly as possible ? that 's what i felt like while reading this novel . the composition of this novel was , at best , junior high level . and , to top it off , i live in the san francisco bay area and was unable to conjure up any interest in her ongoing blah blah blah about what street she was walking or driving through . i think i 'm going to take bart to the city and abandon the book somewhere in chinatown
