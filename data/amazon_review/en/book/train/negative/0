possibly the worst book i have ever read while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book , it reminds me of the story , `` the emperor has no clothes '' . yes , choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes , the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying . the `` flipping back and forth '' was not accomplished in a smooth , flowing manner . in addition , the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved . the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived . it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone
