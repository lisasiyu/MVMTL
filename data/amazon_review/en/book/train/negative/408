a piece of hogwash ! `` cat on a hot tin roof '' - the version i have is from 1955 , and includes the original written act two , and the act two version tennessee williams wrote for broadway . that said , i found this play to be the worst williams play . i read `` the glass menagerie '' and `` a streetcar named desire '' and i found both to be emotional , engaging , and thought provoking . this play does not include any of that . i failed to see the point , and i did n't understand the motivation for the cruelty shown to margaret ( maggie ) . i was very disappointed . i do not recommend .
