not anne rice at her best ... i may be repeating what others have said in previous reviews , but i just had to vent over this book . after reading interview with the vampire , and the other vampire chronicles before merrick , i was highly disappointed over this book . the action and references to voodun were vague and boring . the book revolves around a plot concocted by david talbot and louis the vampire to use merrick in order to contact the ghost of claudia . then , the book moves into this tedious tangent over the life of merrick mayfair , a character anne rice fails to develop as a complex individual . the action in this book is cheesy , typical , and extremely predictable . the book introduces characters that are related to merrick , and it is not difficult to guess the fate of these characters as a reader . the vampires are barely portrayed as the mysterious , yet dangerous , and bloodlusting characters they once were in the previous novels . the vampires in merrick , especially louis , are portrayed as weak and gutless . yes , louis is a tortured soul , but his portrayal is severely watered down in this novel , and his weak nature is irritating to read about . compare the vampires in merrick to the same vampires portrayed in queen of the damned , like the characters of akasha and kayman , who enjoyed `` devouring the marrow from their victims ' bones '' . the vampires in anne rice 's previous books captured the reader 's attention with their viciousness , and vengeaful , yet human qualities . anne rice did not seem to balance these qualities in the novel merrick as she did in her others . the action in this novel is painfully slow and without direction . the book is also full of references to david 's annoying , perverse tendencies that were written merely to try to increase book sales . skip this novel , and move on to one of her other vampire chronicles , preferrably her early novels . this just does not cut it
