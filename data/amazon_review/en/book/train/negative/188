this book has a special place in my heart this is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention , keep you enthralled , and refuse to let you stop reading . i read this book and literally did not sleep one night because i was too busy trying to finish the book . but what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is , but it 's because how good everything is until the very end . that 's right , the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel . this is `` deus ex machina '' in its finest form . this is unexcusable in my opinion . i just do n't get it . i just do n't understand how one can ( seemingly ) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages . i gave it two stars ( as opposed to one ) for fooling everyone into reading through this book . this is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever
