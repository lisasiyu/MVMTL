a quick read if nothing else when i first read the summary of lost souls i knew i had to get this book . so , on what would end up being an long journey , i phoned my local second hand book stores and after going to three finally found one that actually had a copy ( despite the others that were 'supposed to have one , miss , sorry ' ) . i could n't wait to read it , and in two days i 'd finished the book . now , perhaps it was because my sights had been set so high , or perhaps i expected a well written novel when there was none , but 'lost souls ' disappointed me severely . as another reviewer said nothing , the main character , is possibly one of the most selfish characters i 've come across . i 'm fine with selfish characters , i myself loved lestat of the vampire chronicles , but only when they 're well written . we 're meant to sympathize with him but i found it impossible to do so . he is honestly a selfish teenager and even while reading this when i was a teenager i wanted nothing to come to some revelation . i found the only character i felt bad for in the novel died early on . while the rest of the novel was supposed to be tense , or possibly filled with horror , i found i was flipping through without a true care as to what happened to the main characters . there were a few moments of suspense but nothing too frightful . in all honesty , the book reminded me of the countless horror stories that fill writing websites [ ... ] overall , i would say it 's worth a read if you 've nothing else to do and are craving any type of vampire story . just do n't expect too much
