dumb this is one of the stupidest books i have ever read . the main character , `` fred '' the mermaid , is a mass of neuroses . she 's bitchy , snide and her responses to the most simple of events is weirdly inappropriate . in the very first scene , this 30 year old ph.d stumbles across her parents having sex and completely freaks out , so much so that she violently ( but oh , so amusingly ... ) attacks them both . time for little fred to grow up , i think . the mystery is too easily solved and the men in her life , both instantly , and for no apparent reason , falling in love with her , are simple stereotypes of the gorgeous but smitten male . the first in a series , it seems likely that she 'll soon be having a lot of sex with both of them ; and simple , brainless pornography is about the best i can hope for from this ridiculous book
