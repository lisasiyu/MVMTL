lacks clarity the author talks about all major developments in the field of quantum physics as of the date the book was published , but does not explain them clearly , especially towards the end with topics such as super gravity . the diagrams appear out of sync with the text , and are not explained well . i somewhat liked the book in the begining , but at the end was forcing myself to finish it
