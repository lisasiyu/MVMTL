no improvement over the first one most first novels really are not that great but usually when an author produces a sequal there is a definate improvement but i found no such improvement when trying to read this one . i figured i owed the author a second chance by reading his second novel . what can i say , for all the hype , this book is typical of many published this day by members of the self styled 'creative class ' . politically correct . as subtle as a hammer . as narrow minded as the generation that the author condemns except far less productive and much less imaginative . hardly any good . truth is i found it rather juvenile . in my my mind i found myself editing out the excess wordage . perhaps half could be deleted without effecting the story . there really is n't much here . indeed it is n't a good story . no challenge to the reader at all . blow away the baddies with modern super technology which to make it sporting the baddies are allowed to have some of . it has all the defects of the first book compounded . toss it .
