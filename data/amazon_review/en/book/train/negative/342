do n't waste your money on the audio book this is a review of the audio book version . this has to be the worst self- help audio book i 've bought . i thought this was going to be a reading of the book , but instead the author rambles on and on - apparently paraphrasing the book . i guess its supposed sound like a friend talking to you but i kept getting annoyed at the author repeating herself two or three times . and where were the 100 tips ? i guess the were in there , but i could n't listen to more than a couple tapes . do n't waste your money ... there are much better books out there that give you useful , concrete steps for uncluttering and simplifying your life
