more spin to add to the spin - where does it end ? i was disappointed by this book . it does not help me to understand the 'truth ' about global warming . patrick michael 's subjective ranting throughout the book can be labelled 'humour ' , and 'readability ' , but i have to say that , for me , the rhetorical devices just put me off . it 's just sensationalising the subject . i can understand that he may feel he has a point here , and he may have one , i do n't know ( still ) , but , as a scientist , i find it impossible to take what he says seriously when it is just littered with remarks that would be better placed in a tabloid newspaper . he makes some good points about the links between science , media and funding - how organisations will link issues to the cute and furry animals and so on in order to get more support . but these have been made many years ago , and are n't news to me as a social scientist . ditto for the difficulties for attributing causality ( p.128 ) . what i find , as with lomborg 's book , is that these authors are so busy building a rebuttal to an argument that they themselves produce 'evidence ' that is just as biased , if not more so , the other way , and this reduces their credibility to anyone who is not already convinced that they are right . relying on the rhetoric of powerful soundbites to get those who agree with him is not going to convince those of us who are really trying to learn here .
