misleading title despite what the book title `` grammatically correct '' , this book is mostly about punctuation usages . grammar is limited to a thin , single chapter . there are not sufficient materials on grammar to alert you on incorrect usages , let alone correct them . i would recommend `` painless grammar '' over this title
