get asad it is by far a better text the only reason pickthall is still popular is due to its mass circulation in nations such as india , pakistan , indonesia and parts of africa . firstly he uses archaic language which does not make it easy for individuals to understand the themes and meaning of the quran in a coherent fashion . people `` claim '' that he is very much true to the arabic of the quran ; that his is a very literal translation but lost in context . well that is the point how can it be a `` literal '' translation when it is infact out of context in most places . there is also an issue of a history with this translation , it has been edited more times than most other translations and not by the original translator ( pickthall ) but other individuals . most quranic translations have this humble claim that they are doing their best and they ask for forgiveness if there is indeed any error . that is the problem , most readers who rely on the english ( first hand ) may not even know if there are errors . not only is this translation subjective , nor has it been supported by historical explanations of the quran and lastly most people consider it to be out of context where the translation is not substantiated for with explanatory material or evidence of why the translater chose to render certain controversial passages as he ; ( or now in the case of so many revisions , as `` they '' ) did .
