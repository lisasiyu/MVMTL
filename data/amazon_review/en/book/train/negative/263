absurdity i 'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with , but i began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence . this work , however , is pure tripe . critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it 's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas . the drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play . in my mind , it does n't merit serious consideration and analysis , because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense . beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the `` extremely difficult themes '' and `` brilliant artistry '' of the play
