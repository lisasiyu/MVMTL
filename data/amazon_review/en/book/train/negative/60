extremely disappointing although this book would appear to have a lot of promise , it ultimately fails . like mr. taylor 's self-proclaimed & quot ; certified professional landlord & quot ; title ( fill in your name on page 218 for your own bogus certification ! ) , these phony forms are imaginative but have little to no legal standing . worse , taylor apparently has little respect for his tenants . one form , the & quot ; tenant late rent warning and excuses & quot ; form ( & quot ; to be given to new , renewing , and late tenants. & quot ; ) asks tenants to mark a box as to why their rent was late . sample excuses : i was mugged . & quot ; you did n't come by when i had the money , & quot ; & quot ; i did n't have a stamp , & quot ; & quot ; i 'm dead. & quot ; a chuckle for a landlord , but also a cynical and unprofessional suggestion . taylor 's advice on handling phone calls from prospective residents is even worse - he promotes using a hard-sell interrogation on the first contact that seems destined to drive away prospective tenants . anyone with intentions to do good business would be well served to get more professional advice than this extremely disappointing book
