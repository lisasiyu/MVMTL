please be very careful ! this book can be very damaging if you approach it with the idea that it is absolute truth . as some readers have complained , this is not really a `` christian '' book because the focus is n't on christ , it 's on you . a biblically centered way of dating would put the focus on loving other people unconditionally , the way jesus would , and not on trying to `` find the perfect spouse . '' the whole premise of the book is rather un-christlike : making yourself enticing enough to the opposite gender that someone would want to marry you . it 's rather selfish , really , when you consider the words of john the baptist : `` christ must become more , i must become less , '' as well as the warning in song of solomon `` do not awaken love until it so desires . '' should n't our primary goal be to glorify christ and not search for earthly shortcuts to fulfilling our desires ? finding a spouse is not like science nor business which have clear procedures or even guidelines . hearts can be broken , and therefore authentic , christlike love must take precedence . i do n't mean to sound accusing , but this book borders close to the type of manipulation that the world cleverly calls `` seduction . '' my brother humorously commented that the book also tries to turn you into a `` poser . '' this happens when 'forcing yourself ' to be more masculine or feminine in order to entice the opposite sex . you have to ask : what kind of people are you trying to attract ... people who are enticed by your masculinity/femininity or people who are excited about you for who truly are ? i personally would rather a lady be attracted to me for my fruits of the spirit than my looks or personality . it is a combination of both action and faith that is important . faith to set the situations up . action to knock em down
