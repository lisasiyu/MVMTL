charlie should have burned the manuscript ! i 've read a lot of stephen king 's work , and loved most of it , but 'firestarter ' was a big letdown ! it 's not quite in the 'abomination ' category of 'from a buick 8 ' , but at least king could blame that one on his car accident . this one is probably only about as good as 'the tommyknockers . ' the premise is great , but once it gets away from 'andy and charlie on the run ' , and becomes 'the life story of tom rainbird ' , it goes downhill very quickly ! not to knock king too much , but as this books goes along , it seems obvious that sk was losing interest , either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason , and wanted to 'explore ' the supporting characters more ; or simply because this book came out fairly early in king 's career , when he was known to partake of certain 'substances ' which he later swore off ! worth reading only if you really want to read every sk novel . otherwise , just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one ( with the exception of the two mentioned above ) surpasses 'firestarter '
