endless tape that repeats itself there is no significance in this book . most of the people already know that there are sweatshops out there . it can be in the us soils or not . they make a product or support the operations . many companies use these practices to make money quick . also i can imagine most of the people understand that it is difficult to be a customer service representative . i really did n't need to be told these ten thousand times . this book did n't make me laugh it made me depressed . no wonder this book is so repetitive since there is not much for author to write on the subject that it is repetitive to start wit
