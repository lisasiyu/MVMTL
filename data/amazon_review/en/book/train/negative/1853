not very inspired after reading about half of this book , i had to stop . i am not very inspired . in fact , it had the opposite effect on me . a lot of the stories i read were too much about the hardships and not enough about the positive outcomes that people had . kind of scared me a bit..is this what i have to look forward to as the years progress ? i was more inspired by montel 's book ( once i got past the ego part of it )
