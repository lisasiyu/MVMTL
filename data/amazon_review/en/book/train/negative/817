disappointing ! ! i found this book a truly disapointment ! ! when i started the book , the story of abby and lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . then the book advances to this days with the story of declan and lena , and it was ugelly disapointing ! ! they do n't have anything in commun with abby and lucian ! ! lena and declan , they do n't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . i only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with abby and lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i do n't now how but that was not what i expected !
