not worth the money i own a strategy guide for every final fantasy game , and this one was sorely disappointing . i think the only guide that has been worse than this is the ff9 'playonline ' joke ( that no longer exists online ) . the strategy guide leaves out several key elements of the game ( such as how to find aeris ' limit break before disc 2 ) , how you can reach certain areas , where to find items , who to have in your party in certain areas , etc . the information was blatantly inaccurate or extremely confusing . some of the maps are mislabeled and look more like a random assortment of screenshots than a coherent guide . all in all , do n't waste your money on this guide . you 're better off buying the brady version instead
