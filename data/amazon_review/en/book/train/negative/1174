unsuitable for undergraduates the original mechanical engineering design book written by joseph shigley , and later , with larry mitchell , was an excellent undergraduate text ; it was readable at the introductory level , and it contained enough information and methodology for use as a good reference book after graduation . unfortunately , this revised text , which was rewritten by charles mischke , is thoroughly unreadable , obfuscating , and is totally unsuitable as a text for undergraduate mechanical engineering students . the book is full of nuances , subtleties and informative data that do make it useful as a reference book on the shelf of an experienced design engineer , but not as a text for students learning the subject . for those who plan to teach a course for mechanical engineering majors on this topic , i recommend other texts such a jack collins ' mechanical design of machine elements and machines , wiley , 2003
