leaves me cold this rates as one of the poorer mysteries i have read in years . it was truly an ordeal to finish , and i am left wondering why i bothered . it has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters , many of whom are stereotypical creations of little or no interest . i was particularly amused when the detective was told to & quot ; make a few inquiries at the transsexual shoe shop , giving the size and style of the shoe from the corpse & quot ; . in all of la , i am sure there is just one known & quot ; transsexual shoe shop & quot ; . please . i suspect ms. laplante has better material , but this is a poor example better left unread . i would give it less than one star , but unfortunately that 's not an option
