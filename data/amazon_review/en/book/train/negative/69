do yourself a favor and pass on this piece of garbage i also bought the hype of nytimes best seller . goes to show you some people have really bad taste . the story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog . it seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition , entire scenes which added nothing to the story , etc . i would never purchase another book by this author . glad it 's over and this ones in the trash can ... charli
