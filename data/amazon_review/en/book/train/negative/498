i really wanted to like this book if julia glass had not set the bar so high with three junes , i would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2 . there are sentences , paragraphs , even pages of brilliance in this book , but it is as if winning the national book award gave ms. glass unconditional confidence in her writing , and character development in particular . she seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around . as another reviewer wrote , the writing process seemed transparant . reading the book , you get the feeling that the characters are what ms. glass ( a privileged white woman of a certain age ) imagines teenagers , or new mexicans , or black chauffeurs , or hispanic nannies , or even gay people to be like . she is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them . the teenagers and the santa fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures . greenie might be the most believable , and although i understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy alan , i was n't sucked along with her when she falls in love with `` the other charlie '' . he was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth ( even temporarily ) losing your child over . with saga , she manages to develop her most sympathetic character , but saga 's life is left floating and unresolved at the end . even the brief appearance of fenno , who i loved in three junes , lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky . all and all , a very disappointing second novel . you have to wonder , since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character , what good is her editor ?
