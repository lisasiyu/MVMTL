really lousy attempt at depth and humor this is the kind of garbage they teach you to write in college -- imitations of what 's on the shelf right now , only `` smarter , '' which really just means `` condescending to those not born with a silver spoon in ultrawhite marin county . '' but you should n't be surprised -- the authoress also writes a blog which is just as bloated with self-absorption ( even if she wants to pretend this is a novel : novels have plots , honey ) . bypass this and read some dorothy parker instea
