not convincing the first 60 or so pages are just awful . john keegan argues that war is not the continuation of politics rather the result of cultural drives . that may well have been so in historical times , but is hardly so today . he unfortunately tries to explain aggression and violence from a biochemical perspective and is not only dated , he 's flat wrong . there 's other problems with his knowledge , i.e. , claiming the u.s . abandoned the draft after ww ii and did n't use it again until the 60 's . wrong again ! what is interesting is that keegan 's very views are so much a continuation of british political thinking . not a great book at all
