save your money i must first say that the only reason that i 've given this book one star is because that 's the lowest amount that i could give it and bach 's lute suites are in the book and the book did n't fall apart . this book gives you no real performance notes , no true historical perspective of the music and how it should be interpreted , and the fingerings are adequate at best . as a teacher , and performer i can only recommend this book if the frank koonce bach book is out of print or you ca n't afford something else . shame on you ariel publ . and jerry willard
