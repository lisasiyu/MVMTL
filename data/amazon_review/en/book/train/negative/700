nothing special i had rated this book a `` two '' in relation to other koontz books i have read . the book is entertaining enough , but is not very unique in relation to other books that koontz has written . koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters . often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning , but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background . koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one . i believe koontz tries to express certain generalties , some of which have moral and religious undertones : in the end , good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature , destroys itself . love is worth fighting and dieing for . love is stronger than evil . what does not kill you , makes you stronger . evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries . the key to happiness is love , not material gain . evil lurks where you least expect it
