excellent writer ... ..poor plot west is without a doubt a superb writer , however i found the shoes of the fisherman to be a great dissapointment . in spite of the fact that most of the reviews i have read higly praise the book , it never really got to me . the concept seems quite interesting at first : an unknown russian , cardinal kiril lakota is elected pope . after being held prisioner for quite a few years , he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity . at the same time , kamanev , the man who had been lakota 's prision guard in russia , and who tortured him beyond belief , has become the head of the russian government . the fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot , which in my opinion is never fully developed . the main issue i have with the novel is that it is plotless ... nothing really happens . a large portion of the book consists of a series of endless , and a bit boring , thoughts from lakota . on the other hand , the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks , which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader . there are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what lakota has to face as a pope , regading human cruelty , poverty , and most of all politics , which could have proven to be enough for a good novel . unfortunatelly , the narration goes astray in many parts , which lessens one 's interest in the book . quite frankly , i had to make a great effort to finish the book , hoping that at some time it would pick up , which it never did . as i mentioned before , west is a very good writer , but this book is in my opinion , highly overrated . i can honestly say it never got my full atention .
