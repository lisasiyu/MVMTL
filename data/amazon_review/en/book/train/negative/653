a gimmick by any other name ... this is a fascinating concept , and a marketable one as well , in light of america 's current infatuation with the edifice complex . considering the author 's scholarly credentials , sex and real estate should have been a absorbing book . & quot ; should have & quot ; is the pivotal phrase here . no question that garber 's body of knowledge is vast -- she hops all over the map with only the most tenuous connection to her thesis . maybe she merely was showing off how much smarter she is than the average reader . while i have no doubt but that this fact is true , the book still quickly descends into boring psychobabble . anyone seeking enlightenment is bound to be disappointed
