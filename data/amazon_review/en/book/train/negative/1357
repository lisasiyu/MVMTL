self analysis , not food lit i usually do not put aside a book before finishing it . in this case , i got about a third of the way through and just skimmed the rest and could not bring myself to read it in detail . i purchased this book hoping ( despite prior reviews ) that it was more food lit than self analysis . however , the strength of this book is in its description of tense family relationships , and indeed not in its descriptions of food in desalvo 's life . if you are interested in it anyway , good luck - there is a lot of emotion in it
