ca n't understand after review it again . this book is very vague . i found the main characteristic of prof. tanenbaum 's book is that he likes to use abstract algebra to deliver his example . for example , in chapter 1 he talks about languages , levels and vm . he uses l0 , l1 , l2 to represent languages and m0 , m1 , m2 to represent virtual machine . for people already have prior knowledge of programming such as c , java , when they read this they could easily reference to something they have already studied , but for me i still can not relate them very well . in contrast , in randal e. bryany & david o'hallaron 's book , the beginning of book gives out a concrete example : the c programming language . i found the latter always work better even after took the architecture course two years later . my point is for people who want to have clear idea of real world , you should pick another book . this book might be suitable for architecture theory ( hopefully ) .
