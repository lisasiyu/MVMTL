broad strokes about student life , not really about the freshman year i expected this book to be about the freshman year experience , based on the title and the way that the book began . however , the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life . the author did not live in a freshman residence hall and i am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not . memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college ( cut corners ) as a stragegy to manage their time
