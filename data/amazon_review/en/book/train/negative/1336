disappointed first , let me state that i have read hundreds of books and have never written a bad review . this book is an exception . i purchased this book hoping to read facts regarding women on plantations . i was disppointed as this book is based mainly on the writer 's view versus historical facts . the book covers the period of 1780-1835 . however , the author on multiple occasions refers to the civil war period . too much `` bouncing '' around throughout the years . yes , she does quote portions of historical letters but i felt these were used most likely out of context in order to support the writer 's point of view without actual facts cited . the writer 's negativity toward other books written on plantation mistresses and their authors , which she refers to frequently in the book , are deplorable . why mention them at all . it only makes one want to read the books that she things so little of . harsh ... yes perhaps this review is harsh . bottom line , i read the book and would not recommend it as good factual reading .
