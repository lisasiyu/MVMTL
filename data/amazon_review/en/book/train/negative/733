great recipes , awful binding i 've reviewed this cookbook before from the point of view of the contents , for which i gave it 5 stars . i use this cookbook all the time and absolutely love it . unfortunately , i use this cookbook all the time and the cheap glued binding has not held up . about half the pages have detached and i 'm a few chapters away from having to pull the whole thing apart and put it in a three-ring binder . interestingly , the same publisher used a sewn binding for the babbo cookbook , so i guess the gourmet recipes get the quality treatment . i would still recommend purchasing the cookbook for the wonderful preparations , but shame on the publisher for using such poor components on a book designed to be repeatedly opened and laid flat
