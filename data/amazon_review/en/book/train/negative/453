not even for the airplane if you enjoy a good , tightly plotted thriller -- read something else . this flabby , clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45 . all of the characters are two dimensional and if you do n't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious .
