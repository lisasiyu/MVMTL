a story she should have kept to herself what is the exact need of academics to write their autobiographies ? case in point : hazel barnes . an academic who was the first to provide a faithful translation of sartre , she also wrote an excellent little study , an existentialist ethics . if she had left it at that , she might have been left with a nice little intellectual legecy , albeit , a mostly anomymous one as her books go out of print and more precise translations of sartre become available . but she has to write her autobiography , and if there ever was a useless tome , this is surely it . though well written , the reader will quickly come to the conclusion that there is nothing really to write about , nothing that could n't have been captured in a magazine article for the new yorker or the american scholar , that is . i found it a surprise that she was , indeed , an existentialst , for she is surely among the most repressed people on the face of the earth . not the stuff of existential heroism and certainly not the stuff to charge a person $ 20.00 or so dollars to read
