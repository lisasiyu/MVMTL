unless revised , checked and almost completely rewritten , this book will remain a one star book ! i bought this book because i saw it in the bargain bin at wh smith for 99p . i hate a lot of things , i hate stamps , i hate fanboys , i even hate fanboys who collect stamps ! but none of those can compare to the hatred i have for this book and my curiosity to read it ! i honestly do n't know where to start ; there are certain facts which he has tried to work his way around or completely dodge . for instance , the videogame killer7 , he claims it has a full blown on sex scene , however i have played this and there is nothing over pg rated ! he also mentions criticising the esrb without offering any proof for what he says ! the same could be said for grammar and spelling , it was completely atrocious , it is unforgivable that he is a lawyer and i believe a 16 year old could do better ! what i found worse about him is the fact he gives out false threats , he threatened rockstar games to pull their gta games from the shelves or he would bring a law suit to them ... nothing happened ! the last thing i would like to say about the book is he leaves out the negative things about him such as offering to donate $ 10,000 to charity if someone were to make a game of a father killing video game designers . about two or three of these games appeared on the internet and he refused to help charities . in the long run , i believe that the perception of jack thompson has gone bad to worse after releasing this book . a very poor and very sloppy read . save your money , as for my copy ?
