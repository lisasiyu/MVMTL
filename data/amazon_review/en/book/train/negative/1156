ugh ... i usually like deaver 's stories , but i actually only made it through half of the book ... then tossed the thing . i am not crazy about the subject matter when it involves children ( even if they are at the teen stage ) . should have paid more attention to the info at the back of the book . and i definitely do n't need to have obscenities every sentence . my mother always stated that people who swore constantly had nothing of interest to say . i find this to be true , even in my choice of literature . my time on this earth is too short to waste reading this type of material . so i am a prude ... karen sadle
