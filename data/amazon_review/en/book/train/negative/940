irritable diet my wife an i bought the book and tried the diet . we could not last the 2 weeks on phase 1 . neither of us can stand the taste of fish , so our limited choices were limited even more . the first week went okay , but by the second week , we noticed that we had become quite irritable . we did not want to see another salad , cheese stick , chicken , or lean ground beef . it was not so much that we craved breads , pastas , and candy . we missed fruit . even though it would only be a few more days to reach phase 2 , we decided to ignore this book and start with a diet based on the government guidelines ( the `` dreaded '' low-fat , high-fiber , portion control diet ) . in addition , we made exercise a part of our daily routine . our moods improved quickly , weight is coming off . we are getting stronger and more fit . it 's been about a month since we quit south beach and we are happy with our current diet and have no desire to dump it . one thing south beach did teach us was the importance of snacking . it really helps with portion control and hunger issues . only , we changed it from cheese and nuts to no-fat yogurt , fruit , or veggies
