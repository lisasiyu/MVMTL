love it or hate it this is the favorite book of a friend of mine , she rereads it every year . she chose it for our bookclub , and the rest of us hated it ! i think this is the best example i know of a book that either really connects with you , or does n't at all . i have a degree in eng . lit . and certainly have encountered a number of books written in an unique or poetic style that i loved , but this one was for me rambling , full of tedious detail that lead nowhere and , since i did n't like a single character , i never felt invested in anything that happened to them . for others what was tedium for me , was poetry . i made myself read the whole book for the sake of the bookclub , but it was like taking medicine -- still i can see that every word was a joy for my friend . this is n't a matter of being good or bad , its obviously a masterpiece for some , but if it is n't your kind of writing , you will find it more than a chore to get through
