off centered book love the beer but found the book to be more a rambling stream of consciousness that does n't really have a point . it really seems to be just sam 's rambling thoughts and recollections of his startup . there are some great anecdotes woven through the book ( and i 'm sure he has plenty that are n't shared ) . he goes over some of the many questions that any startup should answer but the business advice in the book is fairly basic . at the end of the day i 'm not sure what the point of the book really was supposed to be as several subjects are visited repeatedly . it dose n't go into the brewing in any depth and there 's certainly not enough substance to call it a business book . if your a really huge fan of the beer you may have some interest
