style of writing is painful just start reading the introduction , or flip to anywhere in this book to see all you need to know about it 's readability : a bit rough to say the least . for example , in the introduction , the concept of carrying binary data in a shorter period of time on a wire than several measured pulses was presented in such a confusing manner that i was forced to read it 4 times to understand what was already a simple and understood concept to me . the excessive formality of this book is a killer.. it reads at times like a formal mathematics proof book , however , at other times it is a bit more readable . like people said.. use this for reference.. not for a textbook
