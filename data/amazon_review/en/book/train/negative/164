poorly written and inaccurate a disappointing rehash of early works on the 1781 siege of yorktown . half the book deals with the southern campaign of the american revolution . the portion of the book dealing with yorktown strays greatly from the chronological happenings of the siege . for example , the author starts detailing the story of the assaults on redoubts 9 and 10 , which occurred on the night of october 14th . before completing the account of the assaults , he jumps to the sortie by the british on the night of october 16th and then after several paragraphs goes back to the assaul on the redoubts . a better choice for those wanting to read about the siege is henry p. johnston 's book on the yorktown campaign
