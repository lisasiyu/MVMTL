obsolete ? i got this book to learn mac os x programming and was very disappointed . there 's way too much info on mac os 8 and 9 , which is great for people who are migrating old applications ; but if you 're writing new applications like i am , it just gets in the way . many screenshots are old and do not look like os x windows . it talks about cdef resources , which do not work in os x ; it does not talk about the updated way custom controls are done . code samples use waitnextevent ( ) , which is deprecated . there 's nothing on quartz , but lots of info on quickdraw , which is deprecated . nothing on hiview , opengl , etc . it appears that this was a great book in its day , but now , it 'll probably just confuse you
