do n't read this without reading matus irvin matus wrote the definitively researched text on shakespearean authorship ( shakespeare , in fact ) , and the earl of oxford fails completely as an alternative bard . i would n't go around quoting anderson 's theories in the presence of anyone familiar with matus ' evidence . you 'll get your head handed to you on a platter . guaranteed . it wo n't be a fair fight
