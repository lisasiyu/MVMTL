do n't judge a book by its cover i bought this book for my pre-k class , to go along with our weather unit on rain . the cover looked so nice i thought it would be a great book . in fact , the illustrations are quite nice ; the problem is there 's really no story here . the language does n't flow ; its very choppy . the children did n't enjoy this book , and have not asked for it to be read again . good children 's literature should have a story to it : a setting , problem and solution ; a definite beginning , middle and ending ; and well-defined characters . this book has none of that
