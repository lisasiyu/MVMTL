i followed this book for a couple of years when i was a university student 14 years ago , i followed this book to the letter - 3 days in the gym every week for six months and then a split system which got me in the gym 4 days a week for another year or so . in hindsight , it worked ( as any beginner gets a little bigger anyway just by heading to the gym ) but i picked up a copy of brawn a year later - training twice a week just focussing on the big exercises and realised far better results . this book is good for motivation , a trip down memory lane for some ; it has some good ideas but generally the routines are n't suitable for anyone training without steroids . i wonder why joe weider never discussed the issue when obviously so many , if not all contributors , depended on steriods to realize their success ...
