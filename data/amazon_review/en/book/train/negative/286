the colorado kid , the king flops i was terribly disappointed with this king release . could a creative writing student done better ? perhaps . it was by far the worst published work i 've ever read . it was unreadable . throughout the entire first chapter i waited for a plot to be formed . the characters were choppy and the story went nowhere . the book seemed to be published on his name alone . i have been disappointed in s. king for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch . i am a long time fan , i began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book i read , written by him , was hearts in atlantis .
