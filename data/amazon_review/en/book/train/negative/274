what was i thinking.. ? ? ugh ! ! ! first time i looked through this book , was curiosity of my local library . checked out , and was blown away with how cool this book is . that was 9 months ago . being a big u2 fan-and since the price had dropped considerably-decided to buy the book . after a few minutes of 'reading ' it , realized how crappy the pictures in the book are . seemes like 90-99 % of the pictures are washed out , grainy , and horribly reproduced here . was there any quality control as this book went to press ? and for those 'new , never before seen pictures ' they are pretty ho hum . because its not totally horrid , i 'd give it 2.5 stars . just , well , disappointing . if i had to pay the full msrp , i 'd give it zero stars . while i must say , for $ 14 or so , you do get some good training on how heavy your next laptop will be ...
