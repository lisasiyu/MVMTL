all that glitters is not gold `` a long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish . not just an ordinary fish , but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean . '' this is a book i have some trouble with . it is beautifully illustrated , and the glittery silver scales make it very appealing to children . however , i am not entirely sure it is sending the right message . i like to give the author the benefit of the doubt that he meant well , that the overall message is that vanity and posessions will not make you happy . but ultimately the solution to the rainbow fish 's problems give unclear messages , and can possibly be interpretated that to make friends you need to buy them . other interpretations have been covered comprehensively in other reviews and include possible biass towards communist values and a want for sameness
