nothing that 's not in other books there 's nothing in this book that is n't in many other photography books . much of the book is taken up with definitions and discussion of equipment and techniques , rather than approaches to creativity ( as is implied by the sub-title of the book ) . the photos are far from inspiring . i did n't learn anything from this book
