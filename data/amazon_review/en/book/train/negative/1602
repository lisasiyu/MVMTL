off his head : a silly plan to replace the welfare state no serious economist would take such a proposal , well , seriously . in short , murray 's argument is foolish . inflation would eat up the redistributed $ 10,000 , and , unless the `` gift '' money were indexed to inflation , that $ 10,000 would be worth about $ 100 in a couple of years . inflation would come in many forms : higher rents , higher food and fuel bills , etc . for example , an important reason for a food stamp being a food stamp is not just to ensure that the money is spent on food , but also to ensure that more paper money is n't loosed upon the economy causing unforeseen inflationary pressures . food stamps do not cause inflation ; murray 's program most certainly would . buy the book if you want , but be sure to brush up on your economics as you read this absolute and utter nonsense .
