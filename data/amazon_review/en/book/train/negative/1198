defeatist treatise on the process of canon formation harold bloom , borrowing the metaphors and terminology of psychoanalysis , interprets the poet 's relation to tradition in terms of an agonistic oedipal struggle , arguing that the ( `` belated '' ) poet 's literary productions result from a conflict with a `` strong '' father figure with whom he must compete through a number of rhetorical phases representative of the `` repression '' of his own poetic self and the strong misreading ( or `` misprision '' , as bloom calls it ) of the work of a predecessor . bloom 's conception of the `` canon '' is a hierarchical , continuous and genealogical model of direct succession , as the young apprentice to the craft of literature subjects himself to self-imposed austerities , ridding himself of prematurely smug complacency , opening his text to the strong aura of the canon , and testing his productions against it . however , bloom 's argument is undercut by his own acknowledgement that many great writers can afford to nevertheless produce great literature by debunking the whole issue of influence , belatedness and originality , and allowing their works to flow forth from them spontaneously . this admission risks making the importance of the canon altogether trivial . another difficulty is the understanding of many writers that the ideas of & quot ; influence & quot ; and & quot ; tradition & quot ; can entirely do away with the idea of belatedness , for the poet can not be belated in a world of which he or she can still have an impact through writing and teaching . bloom 's defeatist reliance on canonical precedents , and his implicit regard that new writers have arrived too late in history to produce truly original works , reflects the postmodern & quot ; fin-de-millennium & quot ; langour that all sources of inspiration have been exhausted , and that we must abandon all hope of creating new works , but merely repeat the past . not only are his conclusions totally untenable , but his whole treatise , on its insistence on returning to canonical precedents , fails to provide for a more dynamic , more forward-moving ( as opposed to reversing , revising and troping ) theory of poetry , a theory capable of affirming life and history more fully . it would be interesting to discover what bloom would make of henry adams 's remark : `` everything is respectable and nothing amusing . there are no outlaws .
