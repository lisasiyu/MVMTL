red hat linux bible i bought this book with great anticipation , however as i started the install it went to frustration . i know nothing of linux when i started this , and it became a disapointment . the information in the book generaly does not line up with the linux i installed from the cd that came with it . also the comands that he talkes about wer not present when i tried them . allot of the setup comands you have to install manualy , i had to do allot of trial and error . his book is also badly organized i find , i found my self fliping to differant sections of the book for the same item . some of the instructions for setup at the install are in the middle of the book . this may be a good book for when you know what you are doing , but i dont recomend it for the beginner
