obvious ideas i was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine , for a topic at the university . she came to the classroom with this book , as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching . first of all , i thought it 's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom . secondly , the things the authors wrote are so obvious , at least for some persons , that all i can say is that i really had a very good time reading it as a comic book , nothing else . i laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil , because he touched her on the arm . it was a lecture , not a simple explanation ! clearly we have to be polite , encouraging and nice towards the students . but this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way , that i could only laugh . i never had problems with students in my classes , i always tried to encourage them to like the subjects ; i am sure they learned many things , as well as i learned from them , too . this book was just a waste of time . the worst thing is that the teacher i am talking about , the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is , does n't practice what the book preaches ! she is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to . how is it possible ? she did n't learn anything from it ? ? ? maybe it 's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then i would say read it , but even though i would be very cautious . but being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states , i could imagine it would n't really be that good .
