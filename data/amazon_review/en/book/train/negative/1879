confusing and long-winded this was the first of ms. peters ' books that i read . maybe if i had had the background of the other books , i would have found it more interesting . as it was , i kept thinking `` get on with it already '' . there were too many exceprts about nefret and her hubby and then it would switch back to peabody and emerson , and it rarely went back to the murder . when it did , there were so many characters and so many nicknames for characters that i was totally confused and often had to go back in the book to see who was who . the setting in this book and peabody 's wit kept me reading , though .
