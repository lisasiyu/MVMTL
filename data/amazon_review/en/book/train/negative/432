shallow and depressing i got this book because i enjoy good literature and the reviews were decent . i know some people say this writer is gifted , but i do n't see it . i thought it was a pretentious , depressing piece of crap . the characters were full of self-loathing and the `` bright ending '' did n't redeem anything , not the main character or the book
