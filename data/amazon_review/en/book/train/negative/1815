too little about machiavelli 's context and influence this is a fine book if you want to see what someone very smart has to say about machiavelli 's major works . what i wanted , however , was to understand the context in which machiavelli wrote , and i would have loved to get some information on how and why his ideas began to have influence beyond florence . if you understand references to the founding of rome , to 15th century papal politics , and have a good grounding in livy , this book is for you . if , like me , what you wanted from a introduction to machiavelli was to have someone explain machiavelli 's context and allusions , look elsewhere
