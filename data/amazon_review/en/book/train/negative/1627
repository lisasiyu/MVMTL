el bulli- way too hooey ! i was tremendously dissappointed with this purchase . this book has been produced with great care and quality . the photos are first rate , the cd is excellent however as a chef i must say that i strongly disagree with this aproach to food . it is different and wild and unlike anything you will see in the finest of restaurants . but , by taking the art of cuisine and food preparation and presentation into the science lab and creating flavor experiments we are losing the wonderful elegance and nuance of dining ! for most gastronomes this book and this food is a let down . david leicht , certified executive chef , american academy of chef '
