very stupid book i purchased this book thinking that it would have good ways to make my boring room look a bit interesting , but i , as a thirteen-year-old , was n't impressed with the ideas in the book . condratitory to what the author says , the projects were not fun , not cheap , not for a teen audience , not interesting , and not a good addition to your room whatsoever . the four themes in this book , which include flowers , teddy bears , funky , and nature , all look as if they were made for the ten-and-under age group . i mean , seriously , what teen devotes their whole room to teddy bears and decorate every inch with the strange projects in this book ? the ideas for the projects are unoriginal , strange , and lame . for example , some of the ideas suggests that you splatter your bedroom wall with multi-colored paints , make a scrunchie holder out of a recycled soda bottle , put a headboard behind your bed that says `` i love teddy bears , '' and so on . yeah , i know , it 's stupid and immature . so if you want a good book that will give you some good room decorating project ideas , definitely stay clear of this one !
