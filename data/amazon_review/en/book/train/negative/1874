broken hearted mom this book is a total joke . my daughter and i had several sessions with frances firman solario . she ruined my family . frances firman solario did not encourage forgiveness like she writes in her book . she cast both mother and daughter against one another . my daughter and i were on better terms before we started seeing frances firman solario . my daughter and i are no longer on speaking terms . my family is broken . i highly would not recommend this book or recommend that you use frances firman solario as a therapist .
