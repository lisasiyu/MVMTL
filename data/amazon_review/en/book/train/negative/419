not worth it i bought this book because of all of the good reviews . i was not impressed . first of all , the writing is mediocre at best . the stories offer little in the way of meaningful character development and delve right into poorly worded sex scenes . the first three stories i read were about anal sex , watching your wife give another man oral sex and humiliating your husband by tying him up and ball-gagging him then penetrating him with a strap on . to be honest these stories turned me off and i 'll be returning the book . save your money this is not good
