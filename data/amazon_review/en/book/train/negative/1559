not that well written i usually really hate to critize a book like this , but this book was not what i expected it to be . this book was to be romantic suspense , but where was the romance ? this book focused mainly on the mystery ( which was solved by the the time you reached the middle of the book ) , and then the story kinda dragged on , probably to finish the love story . the love story was okay , but there was no serious focus on it and it just kinda closed off . in the end , for my first book by krentz , it was not the greatest
