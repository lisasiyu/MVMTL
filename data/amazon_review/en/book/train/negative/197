night of many dreams i can not recommend this novel to any reader . it had too many aspects of the countless , over-the-top feminist rants that are becoming so tiresome . it was predictable that one of the few decent men in the story was dispatched toward the end so that the women could resume their life together . the history , the relationships and the settings were unbelievable .
