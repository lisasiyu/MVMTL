only slightly better than throne not quite the crapfest that was book 3 in the ringworld series , but still a gigantic disappointment coming from niven . children is plagued by the same things that made the previous novel so unbearable : flat , uninteresting characters , ridiculous names , obsession over interspecies sex for no reason other than to include sex in the story , and overall a poorly written plot . to be fair , i did n't come out of this one as bewildered as after ringworld throne - do n't even ask me to summarize that plot , i 've yet to come across a decent one myself , mostly because trying to figure it out can cause lasting brain damage . but even so , this novel is nowhere near the original ringworld novel , or even engineers for that matter . avoid if possible
