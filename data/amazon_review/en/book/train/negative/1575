& quot ; new age & quot ; soap opera how anyone can believe that there is a power to help people live a long life goes beyond my comprehension . this is what estes claims in this book . what about those who live short lives ? the whole book is geared at american middle-class readers who in general , even though they have college-education , are very naive . the language is that of the fairy-tale , or close to it , which suits a tv-fed and tv-indoctrinated people . estes says that pain will clarify everything . i pained myself through her book and nothing was clarified
