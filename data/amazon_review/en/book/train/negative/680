felt like a marvel story , but then again ... there is no perfect earth . the dc universe is corrupt ? let 's see ... joker actually turns out to be a hero ( i know , he 's not presented as one , but he offs al , so he 's a hero ) . wonder woman kills someone ? yeah , right . batman actually points a gun at someone ? yeah , right again . the big blue schoolboy saves the universe ? hack , ptooey . everybody makes mistakes ( the big idea from the series along with there 's no perfect earth ) . it 's too bad that dc did n't realize that this series was one of them
