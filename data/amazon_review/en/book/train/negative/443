woeful i have been reading cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990 's i thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there . her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - trace - represents an all-time low . the thing that got me was the level of the writing , it just seemed so flat and lifeless . i found it repetitive in the first chapter when scarpetta is saying to herself that `` she should have been told ... . '' . it just seemed so ordinary , almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like cornwell .
