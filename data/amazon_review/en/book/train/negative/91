great book ... .if your name is chicken little ! ! ! ! to see my point read edgar c. whisenant 's `` why the rapture will be in 1988 '' ha-ha-ha-ha ! ! ! ! ! do n't be taken in by tim lahaye 's false prophecies asd broken promises . this book has stated nothing that christendom has not heard before . it 's the same old `` the sky is falling '' , superstitious , nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times . for example : 1john 2:18 , 4:4 - john thinks he is living in `` the last times . '' he `` knows '' this because he sees so many antichrists around . 1 peter 1:5 , 7 , 20 peter believed that he was living in the `` last times . 1 peter 4:7 `` the end of all things is at hand . '' james 5:8 james thought that jesus would return soon . readers , has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called `` end time signs '' did not apply ? the civil war , wwi , wwii , the could war and all other wars and rumors of war was n't good enough ? one of the signs of the `` mark of the beast '' started in 1948 . the doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the social security number system . recently , someone `` set a bad precedent '' by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip ( in the wayward animal of course ) it seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the chicken littles has been making excuses ever since it all began . 2 peter 3:4 `` where is the promise of his coming ? '' the author of 2 peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers . he knows that jesus , who was to come soon , did n't come at all . many have begun to ask , `` where is the promise of his coming ? '' he tries to cover for jesus by claiming that `` one day with the lord is as a thousand years . '' mat : -16:28 verily i say unto you , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom . revelation - 3:11 , 22:7 , 12 , 20 quotes jesus ( 1900 years ago ) as saying , `` behold , i come quickly . lahaye 's book reads like tabloid trash . ! ! ! ! !
