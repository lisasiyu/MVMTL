animals deserve only love and tenderness animals should never receive negative punishment ( physical or mental ) . why should you , when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does ? the use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology ( as it is utterly unnecessary ) and a need to be sadistic . as a veterinarian and animal lover , i strongly advise against this book
