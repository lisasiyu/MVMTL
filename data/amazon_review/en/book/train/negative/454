this book is pathetic i would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good . overall the book in my mind can not even be compared to notes from underground which is a true existential work of art . my bias i believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person , not just simply more apathetic such as the strangers main character . i found the book to be very boring . this is just my opinion , and many people find the book great and i have no quarrel with that
