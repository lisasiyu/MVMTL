who is this about ? i bought and read this book for a class and found it very difficult to take much away from . the accounts are potentially very enlightening , but the author 's writing style obfuscates their values . her interjection of her own personal stories into the work was sloppy and often left me unsure of who i was reading about . while i do n't know of any other book which tells these stories , there are many other books that contain similar accounts which are far more effective
