disjointed narrative i had originally seen this book as a subject of pbs ' frontline several months ago . i was enthralled by the subject matter and decided to get a copy from the local library and read about it myself . what a mistake . the pbs frontline tv program was so much better than the book . i found maraniss ' switch from the viet nam story to the university of wisconsin protest story very aggravating ; and , as another reader mention , it made for a very disjointed narrative . the juxtapositioning of the two narratives does not work ! i found myself more interested in the war portion of the book than reading about soglin and his friends embroiled in a protest against dow chemical . frankly , i found this portion of the book to be quite a bore and it almost ruined the book for me . who cares about college kids and their protesting episodes . it is simply not important . if you are interested in reading the book , read the nam portion and skip the protest chapters . better yet , catch the frontline episode and skip the book completely .
