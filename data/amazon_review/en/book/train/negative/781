christian fundamentalism dramatized even the avid `` trekie '' reader of the star trek science fiction novels , movies and television series must suspend disbelief , when he finds captain kirk saying `` beam me up , scotty . '' but the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort , when he reads in this book that jesus will effectively beam millions of true christians up to heaven in the world-wide `` rapture . '' though the characters and their roles are fictitious , the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer . the story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass rapture event , and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions . in the september/october 2006 issue of foreign affairs walt mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions . instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform . billy graham 's biography by strober notes that they criticized graham 's `` new evangelism '' for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems . yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the `` tribulation force '' or as exemplified by jerry falwell 's moral majority . they are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the united nations . mead notes that it is no coincidence that the left behind novels show the antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the united nations . the u.s. statistical abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially , while evangelicals and liberals - e.g . southern baptists , lutherans , presbyterians , methodists - and catholics are continuing their per capita declines . such data and the reported popularity of these left behind novels indicate fundamentalism 's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary american society . i see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the `` left behind '' in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern american society , and as conservative christians who believe it is better to stay behind . and in not just a few respects , they may be wise to do so . thomas j. hickey
