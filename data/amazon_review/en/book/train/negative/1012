rate this book an `` ... incomplete guide to the classical ... '' ( `` complete '' guide to the classical '' ? ... there 's a warning word for you ! ) judging by the numerous 5 star ratings , some people presume to learn from robins ' style of writing and illustrating an art instruction book . moreover , robins subtitles the `` art of figure drawing '' as : `` the complete guide to the classical tradition '' ; well , it is n't ! it is anything but a complete guide to the `` classical tradition '' . in fact , it is exactly the opposite of the `` classical tradition '' for teaching drawing . before purchasing this book , the reader should do a web-search for luca cambiaso ( born 1527 died 1585 ) . luca cambiaso , genoese painter began using simplified cubic shapes as a kind of shorthand drawing style , and is believed to have been the author of the method of dividing the human body into small squares in order to give correct proportions . art authorities believe that rennaissance masters passed `` pattern books '' to their students for study . of these , luca cambiaso 's drawings are about all that remain of these `` block figure '' rough sketches . some of these can be found on the internet , just to give you an idea . at any rate , the point i am making here is that these `` block figures '' [ which jack hamm calls simplified figurettes ] are at the core of the classical tradition . robins fails to include block figure , human puppet , or simplified figurette drawings that must be part of a book referencing the `` classic drawing techniques , '' because such block figures are much represented in books genuinely invested in `` the classic tradition '' . i do not really understand why , but it is quite common today , for authors not following the classical tradition to claim exactly the opposite . they claim to teach the classical tradition , but they do not ? to be blunt , it 's a rip-off of some kind . robins is entirely misleading in his title . rather than being invested in `` the classical tradition '' robins is vested in the `` contemporary perspectives '' approach to figure drawing . classical tradition per se , is more represented in books by walt reed , or jack hamm & edgar loy fankbonner & others where block figure or human puppet drawings , along with intermediate steps for refining rough sketches by degree , make up the real `` classical tradition '' . ( i know i 'm being repetitive here , but i simply insist on making the point ! ) another fundamental flaw in robins method , is that he offers what one amazon book reviewer has termed , `` invisible problem solving , '' whereby the final drawings are shown , avoiding the beginning or intermediate steps which are used to arrive at final drawings . the last manga drawing book i peeked at contained no less than 70 pages ( out of a total of 190 pages ) on human ... ( human , not cartoon , mind you ) anatomy using a honegumi skeleton for illustration . this included basic instruction that any complete guide ought to have : how to draw human eyes , ears ( from front and back view ) , nose , mouth , musculature and bone structure . in this regard , the use of a basic anatomical device such as a honegumi skeleton or `` simplified figurette '' as jack hamm calls them , is fundamental to basic drawing . and this is my criticism of clem robins ; that he has titled his book a `` complete guide '' but it certainly excludes beginning students as a target audience . the price is too high , when there are more thorough guides to human figure drawing still in print for less , some of them published over 50 years ago . mr. robins himself recommends george bridgman to the book buyer , over his own text , so what 's the point anyway ? the point is , that whether by publisher or individual author , the `` how-to-draw '' market is flooded with books that some will buy , confident that they are acquiring the very best of the figure drawing tradition . i would shrink from a purchase that contains an author 's personal caveat emptor .
