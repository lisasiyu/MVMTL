not up to standards i 've read all of dianne dorrans saeks books and own many of them . i eagerly await each new addition so i was very dissapointed in california interiors.it appears to be written and photographed for a european market . it 's all stuff we 've seen over and over again with no cohesive theme . the graphics are n't up to her usual standards , the book does n't seem to have any design . it looks as though it 's a first time effort
