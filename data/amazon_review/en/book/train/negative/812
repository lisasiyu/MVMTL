when a high initiate in eck becomes twisted by the dark side what so many past and even some current chelas overlook is that there is a difference between sri harold klemp , the man , and the eck which uses and continues to use him as its divine channel in all the worlds of god . recently i took the fourth initiation in eckankar . yesterday , while in contemplation i sang my new secret word with my attention on the current living eck master and experienced the light of god . ford johnson 's assertion that chelas are prevented from becoming masters is a falsehood . before millie moore translated she had reached the ninth initiation , the point at which eck mastership commences . it 's sad to see a former high initiate like ford johnson who has become 'twisted by the dark side '
