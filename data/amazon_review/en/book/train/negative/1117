not what i expected i thought this would be a list of adult grahic novels , like those of harvey pekar . a few were , but many were for children or comic book collectors . i do not think some of them really qualify as graphic novels . from the term `` your library '' i understood my own personal library , but seems it is for public librarians serving a mixed public . fine , but i did not see that in the editorial description
