determinedly bleak i started this novel after reading erdrich 's love medicine . while it is clearly not as lyrically written , it is more accessible , and i admired erdrich 's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters . i never finished `` beet queen '' , quitting not that far from the end . when celestine 's child turned out to be so impossible , it was the last straw . `` beet queen '' is just too determinedly bleak , to no higher purpose i could discern or discover in reading reviews here .
