this is no `` the accidental diva '' i like the energy of the book . but the characters like izzy and rico i found to be more mulitfaceted than destiny . destiny sounds pretty , driven and of course she has a the `` sad '' story plot . but i expected her character to bring more . yeah she is a hot party planner living in mom 's shoes but felt something was missing from the character/reader connection . i thought izzy had more juice ! lyah beth , write a book about her ! plus the `` the knight in shining armor '' came around like around page 176 . the book is only around 250 pages ! by this time i was waiting to met mr.taye crawford and when he arrived he seems just as boring as destiny 's charater . i was very disapointed . this book is no `` accidental diva
