the chocolate war -parents beware i purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th grade . i am very glad that i read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it . this book is about gang violence ( although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders . ) the book is also about angry , jaded , hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes . the ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience ( while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill . ) before he is taken away in the ambulance , the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do . the message here is do not buck the system , no matter how corrupt the system is . within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation . ( another re-curring topic . ) i knew that it was questionable whether or not i would allow my son to read this book . i read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book . there is n't . this is the first book that i have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else . save your money . i do n't care how many awards this book received . it is pure trash
