how did this book win an award ? i am a fan of michael crichton 's . having said that , i felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy , and that certain characters were not well developed at all ( e.g . the wife ! ) the basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful ; it moved along at a fast pace . however , crichton added too many characters , and made the book too dense . i had to skim the last several chapters because i wanted to know what happened at the end , but i was getting extremely bored . obviously , he has come a long way since this book : - ) sigrid
