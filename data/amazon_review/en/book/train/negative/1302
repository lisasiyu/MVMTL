replica of her amanda quick 's scandal if you 've read her amanda quick novels , this contemporary story is almost the exact replica of the novel , `` scandal '' . heroine proposes to hero , who has a hidden agenda . of course he 's rich and he has almost the same history as `` scandal '' , whose father has gotten into debt and gets out of the picture leaving the family to deal w/ the debt , and the oldest child having to pay back debts that his father 's friends/business associates want paid right away . of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up . but his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path . the book is so similar that a couple of times i caught myself looking at the cover to make sure i had the right book . the only difference in this book is that one is set in contemporary times and the other in historical time
