its ok but did not change my life i read the book and it was ok . the problem i find with alot of these books is the fact that it is hard to apply them to daily life . the food required is not ordinary food but difficult to obtain and my other family members do n't like it . i would like a book that is easy to apply to my life now . if it is too exotic i do n't have time to learn or to apply it and no one in my family is interested either
