what ! ! ! no garlic ? ? ? ? i was hoping to buy an italian food cookbook . what i got was a cookbook about italian `` inspired '' creations that he , the author , himself created . mostly this book seems like a pat on his back for he mentions how everyone loves this or that dish every few pages ... .and he is proud because he made all the recipes himself ! ! not authentic to me . hardly any recipe contains garlic and i feel forced to doctor the recipes in order to get any flavor . my only hope for this book is that the deserts ( i have n't tried one yet ) makes up for the rest . review addition : ok ... so the tiramasu was very good . bought lady fingers at trader joes just to save you the effort of looking in every grocer and not finding it like i did .
