very little information about strings this book was a disappointment , while there is some excellent background on the structure of matter and quantum mechanics , there is very little on the topic of superstrings . in reading through it , i got the impression that the segments on strings were an afterthought , something that needed to be mentioned but in no great detail . if you need some knowledge of quantum mechanics and the historical development of the understanding of matter , then this book is worth reading . however , if your interest is first and foremost that of the current theories of strings and superstrings , then quite frankly this book is not worth your time and money .
