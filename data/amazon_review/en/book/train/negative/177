disappointing this book has a lot of names . i 'll give it that . but , there are some relatively common names that are missing . and so many invented names . my favorite of the invented names are schmoopie and poogie . as if these names will show up on a birth certificate ! ! the definitions/origins of the names are poorly researched and confusing . for the name `` cowboy '' the book tells you it means `` country '' for the name `` country '' it tells you it means `` western '' . not that either of those is a standard name , but , for `` words as names '' are n't you going to pick it because it has meaning to you ? also , the lists are totally false , something the author ( if you can call her that ) made up while sitting around drinking with her buddies . and some of the names on these lists are n't even found later in the book . ( ex . lynus on the `` party animals '' list ) i wish i had held out for a trip to the bookstore instead of just picking up the first book i saw at walmart . i figured with so many names i would find one i liked , but i am just so distracted by all the junk that i will never find a good name here .
