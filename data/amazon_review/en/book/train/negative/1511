triathlons for beginners sally edwards is an impressive athlete , that 's why i bought her book . i was looking for tips from a former ironwoman . what i got was a book geared toward women who are just beginning a fitness program , not serious athletes who are training for triathlons . this book is chock-full of really bad advice ( `` if you do n't have a hrm , put down this book and go buy the best one you can afford '' ) and completely inadequate training schedules ( for endurance training , she recommends 45 minutes to 1.75 hours of training per week ! ) , this book was a major disapointment . edwards should have given her book a more realistic title and marketed it to the weight-loss crowd , not serious female athletes looking for good advice . joe friel 's `` triathlete 's training bible '' is a much better choice for serious athletes . if you want to look better in a bathing suit and have impressive stories for your friends at work , this book is fine
