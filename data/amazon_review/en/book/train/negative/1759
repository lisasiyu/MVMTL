a book full of examples of how not to write perl i could n't resist the title , so i got this book . unfortunately , i can not reccommend it to people who want to learn to write better perl , execpt as a source of examples of the mistakes you should avoid . for example , in one of the earliest examples , the authors uses `` return undef '' in a situation where the return value of the routine is assigned to an array , to indicate the routine did n't find any of whatever it was looking for . unfortunately , this is a mistake , the correct code would be to use `` return ; '' all on its own . the correct solution produces an empty array or interim values ; the mistake creates an array containing one element , 'undef ' . there are a number of similar mistakes which indicate the author is in over his head , writing things he does n't understand ; the editors know even less about the matter ; and the code was never tested and verified for correctness . if you want to learn perl , get `` learning perl '' ; if you want to improve your perl , get `` intermediate perl . to
