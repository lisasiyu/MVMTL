very fanciful , not data-driven this vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object 's future behavior . people have many connections to a place , which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations . these emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and `` at-will '' citizens for a long time to come . in reading the book , by the way , the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern , american style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends . it 's much more in an old fashioned english amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it 's all sort of breezy . some may like that .
