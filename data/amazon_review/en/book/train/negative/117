wow , how did this ever get published ? this is just a really bad book . first i blame james patterson , but i really really blame his editor . what editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published ? the villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains . just - over the top . the plot line is unbelievable . aside from alex cross and the two villains , nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever . alex cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the fbi to foil the villains . this is supposed to be one of those `` the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world '' type thriller but - there 's no sense of urgency , and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched , and inept ( but not deliberately written that way ) . i could go on and on but it 's not worth the words . this book is really a waste of time . i ca n't believe anybody published it
