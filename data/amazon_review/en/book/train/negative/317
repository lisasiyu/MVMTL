why do people love it ? this book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste i trust , but i 've got to say , i just do n't understand its appeal . it starts out as mildly intriguing , and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative , but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear , and the narrator of the middle section , salt-of-the-earth gardener son , is not only too good to be true , he 's also deathly boring -- a dull-witted drone . i 've read bel canto and the patron saint of liars only confirms my belief that ann patchett 's novels are overrated .
