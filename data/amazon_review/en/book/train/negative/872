historical endnote like hayek 's road to serfdom , this book was written during the secon world war when keynes was busy crafting the post war peace . it is infused with the 1930s ' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the communist version more than the nazi/fascist version . keynes is indisputably the 2oth century 's most important economist but why does schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position # 2 ? i put it down to the same reason as marx ' theory of alienation gained such sway . as there was little else to salvage from marx ' writings , they hit on that to make him apear relevant . marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history . i see little relevant in his work which i feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction . unlike gary becker and other recipients of the nobel prize , schumpeter tackles big issues . but the big issues shrug him off . nothing here to ponder over
