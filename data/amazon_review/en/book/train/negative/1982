poor execution of a good idea the idea was to have the essentials of ac/dc circuit analysis , linear circuits , electronic circuits , digital logic circuit design , electromechanical machines , and control theory in one handy outline . the problem is , any one of these subjects is way too complex and deep as it is presented in most universities for the book to be helpful for undergraduate electrical engineering students . also , on the whole , this material is far from basic . the material on electromechanical machines and control theory is usually taught in junior or senior undergraduate courses.thus , this book would be most helpful to a professional or someone returning to graduate school for a master 's degree in electrical engineering who needs some review on material that they have previously mastered but possibly forgotten . unfortunately , as the other reviewer pointed out , this book is chock full of errors , thus rendering the book pretty much useless in the problem solving department . if a revised second edition of this book ever comes out with corrections to all of the current errors , i would recommend it to the target audience i have already mentioned , but definitely not to undergraduate engineers who are seeing this material for the first time
