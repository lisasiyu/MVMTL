fat kid rules the world when i picked this book up , i expected it to be interesting . as a fat kid , i thought i would enjoy the story , thinking that i would feel connected to the main character . boy , was i wrong . in the beginning of the book , troy , feeling suicidal , wants to throw himself on the tracks , but curt , a skinny druggie , stops him . by the middle of the book , i wish curt had just held back and let troy jump . the book was very slow for me ; each new chapter sounded like the last . i read this short book over two weeks because i just could n't take it . the end was unsurprisingly predictable . i mean , i could 've told you what was going to happen by the fifth chapter . usually , when i read a book , i take something from it , maybe a lesson or a moral . in this book , i just felt a sense of nonclosure ... the ending did n't really do it for me . based on the other reviews on this page , you probably think that i 'm just a mean person who writes scathing reviews on great books . the first part may be true , but i only write scathing reviews on things i did not particularly like . you may not have liked macbeth , but i sure did . whether it 's a good book or not is all a matter of opinion
