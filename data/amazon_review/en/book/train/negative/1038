not what i expected i ordered this book because i really like to cook and love legumes and my pressure cooker . perhaps i should have looked elsewhere . the recipes in here are nicely put together with the nutrition information and there is quite a bit of information on legumes . however , i found that there were too many southwestern chili type recipes for my taste . if you like to make chili and lots of mexican and southwestern inspired dishes this might be the cookbook for you . that is not to say that there are n't some mediterranean and caribbean inspired recipes but it just seems that the tex-mex and southwestern flavors beat out the others . also , i happen to loathe margarine and avoid it at all costs . i love to cook and would much rather use less butter or a combination of canola oil and butter or olive oil or even an olive oil spray -- anything but margarine . not only does this cookbook call for margarine specifically , but diet margarine . in the same vein i understand that the author is an m.s. , r.d . but i really do n't think there is a need to use fat-free dressing for everything . i also did n't like that one of the recipes called for onion soup mix . i have never purchased onion soup mix and try my best not to purchase lots of processed foods . thus , i get very uneasy when a cookbook uses these types of ingredients . one more irksome tidbit was the fact that there were n't any recipes or mention of other beans such as the anasazi , adzuki , flageolet , cranberry to name a few . this cookbook might not be the best cookbook for someone looking for a wider repertoire of legume recipes than your better homes and gardens cookbook can offer
