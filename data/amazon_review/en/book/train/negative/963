are these reviewers as blind as bobby jobe ? i mean , come on . a blind golfer ? i thought it was an intruiging premise , too , until i tried to hit balls with my eyes closed . i 'm a 2-handicapper , and i was completely hapless . so forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down . that said , cullen writes a pleasant , if completely farfetched tale , with likeable characters . however , i thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf . the subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting , believable and touching , and the best part of the book was a short bit about allegheny men and their pickup trucks .
