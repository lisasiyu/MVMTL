historically important , but ca n't stand on its own . this book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in american revolutionary history , but it does n't stand on its own . it is written almost entirely as a response to edmund burke 's `` reflections on the revolution in france '' , so i would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one . otherwise , it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of burke 's points , as one only sees them through paine 's perspective , and paine is far from a fair and impartial debater ; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent 's arguments , and even his opponent himself . i would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what burke had to say , particularly given that history speaks rather better of burke 's misgivings than of paine 's panegyrics . both books were written before the reign of terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793 ; the second part of this book came out in early 1792 . also , history shows us just how silly some of paine 's claims for a republican , representative government are : 200+ years of representative government in the us have hardly banished wars , or the high taxes associated with them , even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time . he makes some good points , and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy , but it is apparent that he failed to see that not all `` democratic '' movements were necessarily benificent , even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow
