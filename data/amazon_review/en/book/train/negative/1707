here we go again . you almost feel sorry for the author . draped in acclaim , among the books of the year , it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations . more worrying , the author 's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at harvard . and that 's what the book feels like , a very well executed assignment . it 's written in a fairly convincing pidgin english , but when it wavers , it breaks the rhythm and the belief . it also feels entirely formulaic . it goes through the trials of dehumanisation ( murder , rape , sodomy etc ) but it never engages the reader 's sympathy , just occasional admiration . there 's no doubt that iweala can write . i hope he dares to produce something fresh that does n't feel borrowed from another culture , another life . i 'd risk buying another book of his
