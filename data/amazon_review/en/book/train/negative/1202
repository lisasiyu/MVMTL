unhelpful and outdated i 'm glad that i got this book out from the library instead of buying it . it provides extremely conventional advice about self-esteem and makeup , and the clothes the author suggests for teens seem like they 're straight from the 80 's . i really do n't know anyone who wears scarves , overalls , or blouses to school . the language and general writing style of the author also seems outdated . i actually checked the publishing date to see if this was a 90 's book ; it 's a 2000 book . ms. youngs even uses the 80 's spring/summer/autumn/winter system of choosing clothing and makeup colors . it 's also annoying that the book encourages confidence in one 's looks and `` beauty diversity '' , yet has photos mostly of stereotypical blonde-haired-blue-eyed all-american-girls . the author herself was a miss teen claifornia finalist , so i suppose one coul n't expect much more . i would avoid buying this for a young girl , or avoid buying it for yourself if you are a young girl
