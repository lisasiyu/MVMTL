wtfo - this does not deserve a review but ... i am a panama ( just cause ) & desert shield/storm vet , and after seeing the movie i read the book ... well almost all of it . this guy is a problem child period ! pissed off at the world , pissed off at life , and very lucky i did n't get my hands on him . snipers are crazy as another review stated , but this guy is that 5 % of the corps that that can give the other 95 % a bad name . some of the boredom issues were true , wives/girlfriends dumping us was true , etc ... but overall this guy just really ticked me off ... but that is his goal in life is n't it ... books about god , country , corps ; things that are still thought , and observed by every marine may just not shock the masses as much as a book aboutsome discontented , nonhacker , shiptbird .
