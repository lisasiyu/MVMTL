very pretty - not so helpful sigh ... like most of andrew lloyd webber 's sheet music , selections from phantom of the opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts . even worse , the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all , rather it simply follows the vocal line . this might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist , but for a real musical theater fan , it 's very disappointing . so far , i 've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment ( an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score ) . the singer 's musical theatre anthology : soprano , vol . 3 , compiled by richard walters features `` think of me '' and `` wishing you were somehow here again '' in their original form . for performers and accompanists alike , there 's something to get excited about . so far , we 're still waiting on more from the phantom of the opera , but they 're creating a 4th edition of the anthologies soon , so watch out
