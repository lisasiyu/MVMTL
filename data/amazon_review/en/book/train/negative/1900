sham not shaman after reading the book medicine woman and the san francisco review of books on the back which says this is an autobiographical i have to question a few things . i come from manitoba and have lived there over 50 years . i 've never heard of a crowley and the cree first nations in manitoba that i was raised with would not be seeing a kokopelli or a kachina . it 's not part of their culture . the last and final huge mistake is the fact that most of this story could not have taken place outside without huge huge bottles of mosquitoe repellant as anyone who lives in the bush in manitoba knows especially those who may have a reason to go naked in the woods . perhaps lynn should n't be peddling her strange brand of spiritualism as true when it 's not . there are enough charlatans in the world without one stealing someone 's culture and calling it her own for the sake of the almight dollar . carol
