a censored history of latin music many people who love latin music and vintage latin album graphics will snatch up this book . be forewarned that there are disappointments to be found inside . the author/compiler seems to look down his nose at the garish , exotic , sexy and sensational album sleeves from the '40s and '50s that we gringos adore , choosing for the most part to showcase politically correct , bizarre abstract art creations from the 1970s . no me gusta ! it 's not that there are none of the earlier variety of album sleeve on display here , but there are not nearly enough . what 's worse , the author interprets `` latin music '' to mean cuban , brazilian and puerto-rican-derived product ; if you 're looking for reproductions of some great old ranchera , flamenco or merengue album sleeves , you 're out of luck . the richness and diversity of latin music is missing from this book . cocinando ! is certainly a groundbreaking collection , but by no means is it definitive . i hope someone follows up this incomplete history with another that presents the golden age of latin music from a more unbiased viewpoint . i 'd like to take the opportunity here to tout the collectability of vintage mexican album sleeves ; many of them are absolutely gorgeous , and they need to be recognized as the works of art that they are .
