soporific and overly wordy . reads like a law textbook . author often uses three sentences where one would do . much ink is wasted telling the reader `` we wo n't go into that here , but chapter `` x '' deals exclusively with that . '' concepts are understandable for those with an accounting background , but definitely would not recommend to someone without a solid grasp of accounting fundamentals . author should have hired a writer to help him smooth out his writing style . not recommended
