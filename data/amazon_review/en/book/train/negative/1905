levenda 's leftist lexicon this is now the third of levenda 's books i have read and the second in this particular series . as other reviewers have noted , by the end of this edition , the author 's leftist political views and anti-catholic epistemological perspective overwhelm the narrative to the point that credibility suffers . this is really rather sad , as levenda is a talented writer , who has done , evidently , some significant research . unfortunately , it becomes hard to take an author seriously who quite rightly attacks the bush clan , whilst holding the hideous clintons above reproach , and worse , misses no opportunity to villify the church , while smiling at wicca . the hypocricy is really breathtaking . understand that , in the corpus of this text , there is much that is worthwhile , certainly entertaining , and well presented . it is simply that the dictates of scrupulosity and exactitude cry out for better balance . this volume ends , as did the last , not with a bang , but with a whimper . in fact , levenda 's last paragraph is , in its entirety , a quote from `` the book of ceremonial magic '' , of all things . we are left wondering as to the efficacy of picking up the next volume in the series . there is much else that cries out to be read . we may read the next in volume , if only in the hope that some sense of balance can be restored . but this may be another example of the triumph of hope over experience .
