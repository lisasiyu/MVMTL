very difficult to follow - frustrating writing style gosh , maybe i should n't review this book , but then - any book that i bring home that is so difficult to follow that i just could n't finish it probably deserves one star . while the subject matter was of great interest to me , the writing style was not a comfortable read . i was constantly trying to remember who was who , what time period it had just jumped to and then jumped to again and , worst of all , the flow of the words was simply missing . hard to pinpoint the problem , but by page 42 i was so confused and frustrated , not entertained , and wondering why i was working so hard to read it when i had a stack of other promising new works waiting . ( now i 'm readin 'a long way down ' by nick hornby and was mesmerized from the first page . a perfect example of a well-structured story that just glides from page to thought-provoking page . my full review to be posted shortly .
