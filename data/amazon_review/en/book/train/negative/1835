formulaic i was bored - really bored , which is why i picked this book to read from the free book trade shelves at work . it has a good basic story but is so formulaic that i was able to predict the ending after the second or third chapter . being a medical professional , it was difficult to read about procedures that are outdated now and remember when they were cutting edge . perhaps it 's also a bit scary to remember those i 've worked with in the past who have had the same narcissistic outlooks . i think i 'll pass up the other books by dr. cook that i have not read as of yet . this is the second one of his that , in my opinion , bombed miserably
