money better spent elsewhere ... overall , an 'ok ' read , but teaches human sexuality as though his audience was a grade-six sex education class as rather than mature-minded adults . this book is extremely simplistic and vague , and tends to lean towards a more dellusional depiction of human sexuality , often confining it to the contexts of outmodded biblical principles and male-dominated patriarchy . lacking modern approach and intimate sensuality , i would sincerely hope that this book is not a reflection of poor tim 's seemingly mechanical sex life ! ! i would not recommend this book unless you are totally ignorant and clueless about what sex is all about . i would suggest looking elsewhere for a more relevant guide to sexual intimacy
