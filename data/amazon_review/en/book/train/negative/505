did a six year old write this ? this is the first patterson novel i have ever read , and it is certain to be the last . most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters , but patterson does none of that . the author 's writing style is akin to that of a small child 's , as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters . patterson then holds the reader 's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation , presenting a book written by a ralph wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy . how does the reader know alex was scared ? the reader knows because patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style : `` the man pulled out a gun , alex was scared , alex shot the man and he was happy , and the man was dead . '' do n't believe me ? simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare i had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who i thought he killed , or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist 's evil deeds . quite simply , this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs
