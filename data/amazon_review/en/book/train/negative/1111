stands out ... as a bad book i 'm surprised at all the good reviews this book got . not to be snide , i just genuinely am . this book looms in my memory as the one book i had to drag myself to finish . a book that made me tear up with boredom . the plucky heroine was n't likable , the names were all forced and strange ( none making sense in a universe together -- more like an assortment of characters from different books ) , not on the unique side , really . i thought any originality forced and unfounded , and wished it would have turned out better for me , especially as the `` magic dust '' theory was such a nice start . the ending was n't predictable , but it was trying so very hard not to be , it could n't possibly have been anything but what it was : dull . with all these good reviews , and me not having read it in years , it might be worth trying , but i stand firm : take it out of the library
