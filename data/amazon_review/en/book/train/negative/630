predictable i read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen . as soon as i met the character who would turn out to be the driver , i knew the rest of the story . it was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing . the story 's decent . the text flows nicely , and the suspension of disbelief is strong , but where did nick 's originality go ? where 's the sweet and innocent charm of the notebook , a walk to remember , and nights in rodanthe ? it seems like he 's run out of steam , or did n't care too much about this one . a decent book to read , but do n't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work
