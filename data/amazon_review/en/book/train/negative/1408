what else is new ? jill nelson is just another angry , bitter , whiny black woman with an axe to grind . this book is filled with the same old whining and cliches which have grown really old and tired . almost everything she touches on is so predictable whether it 's accusing black men who date outside the race as being sellouts ( while saying nothing of black women who do the same thing of course ) , demonizing the million man march , whining about the light skin/dark skin thing and basically ranting about how the black woman is a pathetic victim . if it were a black man writing this foolishness , he 'd be written off as an angry old coot in a minute . well that 's exactly what jill nelson is as far as i 'm concerned .
