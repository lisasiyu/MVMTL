poorly organized , defensively written i bought this book based on the number of favorable reviews and was disappointed . poehlmann 's tone is defensive , and the book offers more rhetoric than useful information . this is a fine book for those who are already convinced of the mycoplasma theory and the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy , but it for those who are seeking more information , it falls flat , chiefly because it fails to offer a cogent , rational uninflected basis for its views
