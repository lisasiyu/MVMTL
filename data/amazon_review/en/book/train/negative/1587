anxiety or not ? i do not recommend this book..other than the part where you learn to peel the onion of your problems..which you will read in any other anxiety book..i do not recommended this book at all ! terrible..the breathing exercises to stop anxiety does not work ! ! its so silly , waste of money ! ! i give it a d- seriously..of course this is my opinion , but i have anxiety , so i would like to help other ppl save their money and time on another book !
