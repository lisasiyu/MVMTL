sadly , this is a message that further divides the world i heard an interview with dr. kushner on npr today . he explained how the comfort in the 23rd psalm lies in the realization that , for example , god is not on the side of the terrorists , or the hurricanes ; he is on our side . why define the world as divided so in the first place ? terrorists are people too . nature is people too . until we accept the fact that god is in all of us , we will continue to place things in `` good '' and `` evil '' bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world . our comfort and relief from psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we ( we , not god or some divine law of the universe ) label as evil . i rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold , full of compassion . unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided .
