how much coffee did feigenbaum drink ? i was going to wait until i finished reading this book to review it - seeing as how i still have 100 pages to go - but i 'm not sure if i 'll be able to ever finish it . the book spends a lot of time telling you the back story about how certain achievements were made in the field of science , but when it finally comes time to report the results of those achievements , the reader is only partially satisfied . very little actual science , and a lot of biographical information . i was hoping it would be the other way around . if you 're interested in reading biographies of scientists you 've probably never heard of , this is definitely the book for you . why would i give a book i did n't finish 2 stars ? because i did pick up a few interesting mathematical tidbits from the sections i read . i just did n't pick up enough tidbits to keep me going . the universal constant is interesting , and the cross section of the chaotic 3-d graph is interesting too . great for scientific history buffs , but those looking for application for personal use , forget it
