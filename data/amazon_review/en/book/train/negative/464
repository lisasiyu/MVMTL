wal-mart is a big lovely bundle of sunshine i guess i 'd better confess right away : i did n't finish this book . i only made it a third of the way before i was too disgusted to finish it . i 'm sure there are many useful things i could learn if i could choke it all down , but it was very difficult . i do n't think it helped that i just finished the case against wal-mart by al norman . i think it 's great that wal-mart was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really did n't have access to a department store or discount retailer , but i ca n't get over the desruction of american businesses , american jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for american workers ( not to mention all the foreign workers who produce wal-mart goods ) that have become standard operating procedure . lower costs at any cost is not a responsible way to run a business , and while i agree that soderquist did a great job at making himself rich and the company successful , i think the damage is costly
