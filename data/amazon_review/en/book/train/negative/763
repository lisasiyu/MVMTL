two surprises i did n't like the text of this book was generally good - although it seemed padded out with a massive listing of model metadata . the book comes with a cd . the first surprise was , the cd does not include the data definition language ( ddl ) for its sample models ... there 's an extra cost for that . my question to the publisher would be , what good is the cd you provide for free ? the second surprise is the illustrations . there are plenty of them , but they look like they were done in a primitive graphics package - not in an enterprise modeling tool . they author seems to have invented his own wierd set of conventions , including `` foreign keys do not appear in the entities ... that is duplicate information '' . before you buy this book , take a look at the illustrations of the models . if you can live with the notation , maybe consider buying it
