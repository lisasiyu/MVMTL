horrible ! elaine feinstein obviously did n't have access to many sources for this very poor biography . sylvia plath certainly cast a huge shadow over hughes ' life , but we get very little insight into the hughes-plath marriage from hughes ' perspective . feinstein does n't know how to write biography -- a difficult art form for anyone who is n't willing to hurt feelings or take criticism . feinstein did n't want to annoy anyone with her lame book . dates are given incorrectly and names are misspelled to the point at which i wonder exactly how much attention the author was giving to her sloppy manuscript , and how quickly she felt she needed to get it published before somebody else decided to cover the subject of hughes in a thorough , responsible fashion . do n't waste your money on this book . check it out of the library if you must , but do n't buy it
