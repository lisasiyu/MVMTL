disappointed golden age fan giordano is a pro from way back in the day ... he has n't been able to adjust to the changing styles and this art book is a sad display of that fact . i recommend getting a straight art instruction book from bridgman , hogarth , or loomis . this book shows his deplorable lack of anatomy knowledge ( seemed to be mainstay back in the 50 's a la ditko & kirby anatomy ) , his simplistic 3d construction , and overdrawn oval shaped good girls , etc . he also graduated from the wally wood school of art where if you did n't know how to render anatomy you blacked it out . still , he was one of the prime lenders to the modern comic language , so i suppose this is some publisher 's way of patting him on the head and saying thanks for the memories . do n't expect to come away with any newer material already covered in `` how to draw comics the marvel way '' by stan lee and buscema ( very simplistic book but the comic dynamics are much better ) or any new sensitivity to modern storytelling . this book can not prepare you for any modern styles . ranks slightly better than a christopher hart book ( need i say more ... ? )
