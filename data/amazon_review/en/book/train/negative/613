great overview-awful editing & amp ; proofreading as previous reviewers have commented , this is a very good overview of the cmmi . the authors work in the industry , and have done an admirable job presenting the nuts-and-bolts of this enormous topic in a straightforward fashion . but if you intend to use it as a tool , like you would paulk 's book on the sw-cmm ( sm ) , do n't buy it yet . the editing in appendix b renders this book useless to me ( i need it as a tool ) . when i compare the constituents of the process areas in appendix b to the cmmi ( cmu/sei-2000-tr-018 ) , there is erroneous duplication . e.g. , & quot ; commitment & quot ; in pmc reads exactly like & quot ; commitment & quot ; in requirements management pa ( it should n't ! ) . ditto for co in sam , co in ma , and the subsequent maturity level 2 process area commitments . the same erroneous cut-and-paste was made for the abilities , di , etc . the level 3 pas have the similar problem , erroneous cut-and-pastes from the rd template . i can not use this book as i 'd intended because of these errors , so i have to lug around the large heavy sei tech reports instead
