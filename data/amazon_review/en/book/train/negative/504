patterson 's second worst ? i rank this book slightly higher than season of the machete , simply because i only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it . i finished this book , but it was hardly an enjoyable read . the one positive is that the chapters are very short , so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace . the actual content , however , is very poor . this book is just surviving off the past cross novels . if someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior cross novels , they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving cross 's estranged son , his other two kids , this new love life , etc . i 've read all the books leading up to this book , and i barely cared or understood what was going on . compare this to kiss the girls or jack and jill , and it comes up way short . the story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed . nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat , and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist . this was by far the worst of the cross books .
