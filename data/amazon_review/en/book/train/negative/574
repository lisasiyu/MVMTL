infamous bridge-burner offers highly subjective opinion on writing no wonder john gardner did n't write more fiction books . he was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction , rather than actually writing it . `` creative atrophy '' i believe john gardner himself would call it . if there 's ever been a better example of the `` those who ca n't do , teach '' argument , i have n't encountered it . this is hardly the place a `` young writer '' should start . instead , how about reading what you like and avoiding `` ignoramouses '' such as john gardner ? john gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world 's finest writers never made it through college , and many more did n't have the luxury of a `` rigorous classical education . '' the most hilarious part is where gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy shakespeare . it 's interesting to note how gardner , who `` taught '' creative writing at the university level , fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education
