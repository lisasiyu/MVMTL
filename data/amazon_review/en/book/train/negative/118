novel goes nowhere , ca n't believe this won something talk about a waste of time ! i was wondering if it was just me so i asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it . it is boring , tells you instead of shows you , hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all . i also found the protrayal of the grandmother 's flirtation with islam to be shallow , un-informed , unbelievable and ultimately dismissive . do n't waste your time on this or your money . luckily i had picked it up at a book sale for $ 0.25 , about what it was worth
