huh ? i read the first chapter and i was puzzled . then i went back , read it again , and laughed . my tenth grade creative writing class can make a better effort at a plot , dialogue , and characterization than that , and be witty to boot . as for the quality of the writing , just the dialogue in the quick stop scene was enough to make my head spin around and explode . after reading this , i was n't sure whether the author was high , or if he just had n't seen a lot of buffy and decided to make up the show and the characters ' personalities ( into something so juvenile and whacked out , it was almost incomprehensible ) . did they let a 13-year-old fanboy write this ? no , that ca n't be , because there is fanfiction out there that is many , many levels above this . ... do n't waste your money on this atrocious mess
