this will bore you to death ! im a regular reader of forbes magazine , and theres nothing i love more then reading about inspirational stories of entrepreneurs , businessmen , tycoons etc so i picked up this book thinking its by `` forbes '' so it must have some great stories . i also rely on amazon.com reviews for my purchases , so everything i say is from the bottom of my heart ... but im sorry you would not believe how boring this book actually turned out to be . the writing style of daniel gross , is well `` grossly boring '' , unispirational , unmoving and generally a waste of your money and time . as far as im concerned : this book will not inspire you , it will not motivate you , it wont even make you appreciate the great accomplishments of the very people it writes about . it is a diservice to the personalities it talks about , and is a diservice to forbes . very disapointed , im just hoping to flog it for whatever i can get . finally i would advise anyone who is genuinely interested in the personalities this book writes about to do a google search and read about them from there , because you will probably learn and appreciate more that way .
