a perfect example of king 's boredom with writing it took me less than a day and a half to read this book . and thats not because i was `` glued to it '' or `` thought it was a real page-turner '' but basically because it was a real fast read . however , this book , as i stated , is a perfect example of stephen king 's boredom with writing horror/fiction . his work within the last decade especially , has taken some well deserved criticism . based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a `` cookie-cutter '' method . now , do n't get me wrong , king is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever . stories that seem to transcend the `` horror genre '' , and incorporate elements of mystery , romance , and drama . however , this is not one . i would rate this book only behind `` insomnia '' as the most insipid king novels i 've ever read . i do n't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of king 's work . but for those who have , it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book , i found myself thinking `` oh ... .it 's going to be another one of these stories huh ? '' these meaning a really generic character , and a foreseeable `` generic '' villian , ultimately squaring off in a very `` generic '' ending . halfway through , i could already see how it was going to end . and this is one of those books where king 's references to east coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product . some examples of king 's finest work would be `` the talisman '' , `` night shift '' ( the best collection of short horror stories ever ) , the shining , the `` dark tower '' sieries , and the stand , just to name a few . and if you have not read any of `` the bachman books '' ( king as bachman ) `` rage '' , `` the long walk '' , road work '' , and `` the running man '' , are some of the most well written , and mind-bending stories ever told . this , however , is n't . and unless you can purchase this book for under $ 2.00 do n't waste your money , or your time .
