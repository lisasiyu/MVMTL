she has done better work this book is an enjoyable read if you have nothing better to do . i failed to be captivated by it . the characters lack the heartwrenching dramatic intensity that you find in her other works . maybe it is because alice walker is such a phenominal author that people just expect so much from her . still , this book is not making the cut for my personal library
