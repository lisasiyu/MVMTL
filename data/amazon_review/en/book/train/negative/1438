george , ( ... ) george has always been my favorite beatle . i have been celebrating his birthday and got the concert for george harrison and watched it on his deathdate , and even wrote my 6th grade biography on him . so , i turned to this book . there were plenty of grammatical errors and false information . i think that it said in the front that he did n't `` hassle any of the beatles for this information '' then how could he even get information such as this . go to i , me , mine it 's a better book because its written by harrison himself !
