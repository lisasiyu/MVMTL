this book is horrible okay , now , for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it , put this book away right now ! ! ! put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it , laugh in a malicious tone because you have n't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written ! ! this book ends with such a melancholy abruption that i thought i might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes . this book ... is horrendous . -angry reader
