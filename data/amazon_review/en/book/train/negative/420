typical gay fare - not worth the time many people have mentioned the embarassing cover art to this book . i agree and it is also very misleading . the characters in the book do not even resemble those guys - the main character 's love interest is an artist who looks nothing like the clean cut characters on the book jacket . things we can do without in gay fiction from now on : 1 . a spoiled egotistical self indulgent main character . yes this may apply to some gay guys but its just boring now in the books . 2 . a distant disapproving father and eccentric mother . yawn 3 . the flamboyant gay friend ( usually black ) first this book starts as a character study - will this selfish debt ridden loser get his act together ? - then it morphs into some sort of romance ( never worth your time ) - then has a whole chapters about the running of an escort service ( fairly interesting ) and ends with a kind or frenetic black humor . it never gels . i kept waiting for the big romance and it was incredibly lame . was my heart supposed to be warmed about him doing threesomes with his new boyfriend and a client ? ? ? ? if you want a real book about running and escort agency read the mayflower madam 's book . at least it 's interesting . if you have to read a book about a selfish gay man - i recommend `` california screaming '' and forget this trash .
