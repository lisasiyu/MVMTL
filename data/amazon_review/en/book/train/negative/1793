potentially damaging and not recommended i have no doubt the author is well intentioned and may in fact have had some good results with the exercises outlined . however , in my years of working with borderlines in clinical settings i think many of the exercises are unnecessary and potentially damaging . many of the people with bpd i have worked with have astonishingly traumatic abuse histories and to explore self-history without the tools necessary to contain the potentially explosive and re-traumatizing emotions is foolish and even hurtful . furthermore , the author 's assertion that the client be able to say that they want to use his text in therapy and the recommendation that if the therapist objects that the client move on to another therapist is totally misguided and naive . i very much agree that it is important for clients to be able to guide their own work , but i am also highly aware of the ways people with bpd can split different providers . there are just too many genuinely therapeutic reasons to approach the author 's recommendations with caution to allow what he says to interrupt what may very well be extraordinary work between a therapist and client . i strongly suggest people look elsewhere , perhaps to the work of linehan for more appropriate and helpful interventions . if i could have , i would have given this book no stars
