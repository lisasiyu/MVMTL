if forced to choose between this book & a visit to the gynecologist -- head for the stirrups . here 's the thing -- i wanted to learn the story of isolde and that is why i picked up this book in the first place . i have read one other miles book ( i , elizabeth ) and that was n't very impressive but i thought i 'd give isolde a try . it was painful ! miles chronically uses flamboyant and overstated language which just feels silly . her characters are very poorly developed . also , the author has a strange habit of often not setting up scenes which is resultingly jolting -- leaves the reader thinking , 'wait ! where the heck did that come from ? ' after reading this book , i could n't decide if i was more annoyed with the author for writing like this or with her editors for publishing such weak , unskilled writing .
