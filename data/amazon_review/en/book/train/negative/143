myth under the guise of 'science'- a warning from a professional logician if you want to read a classic of western mythology , look no further . this is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth ' about reality . the tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers ' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives . dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality , and when evolutionary 'science ' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy , ' this view will come out false . this could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight , so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong , let alone realize something is wrong with it . what almost everyone does n't seem to understand , even about valid arguments is this : all a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false . if the conclusion is outrageous , you do n't , `` bite the bullet , '' `` swallow the medicine , '' and accept the conclusion anyway . you say there must be something wrong with the premises , even if you ca n't point out where the mistake is . it took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why zeno 's argument that 'nothing moves ' is incorrect . but during that period of time , no one ( except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals ' like this dawkins character ) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves
