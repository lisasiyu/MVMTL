disappointed this book was entertaining , but ... there is only one 19-page chapter dedicated to the problem of `` inappropriate elimination '' ( peeing/pooping in the wrong place ) , even though the author himself describes it as `` the number one behavior problem '' . he says `` no other problem causes so much grief and leads them so often to consider the final solution of euthanasia '' . i want to ask the author : given that , do n't you think most people are buying the book for that reason and you should have dedicated more time to this topic ? ? ? the stories in that chapter did not contain any revelations for me - his examples all had fairly obvious causes and were easy to fix , such as the owner changed the litter box , boyfriend moved in , owner had 2 litter boxes for 6 cats , or the cat is doing it out of anxiety and responds nicely to medication ( lucky them ) . throughout the book , i wish he had spent less time making cute anecdotes and more time detailing possible effective interventions
