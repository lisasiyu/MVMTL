god awful the whole thing was just awful , i do n't mind telling you . i do n't know why anyone would buy the book for the recipes to start with when there are so many `` meals in 30 minutes '' internet sites ... all completely nutritional with different caloric contents . then there 's the advice ... it was just as bad , i found . well , bad in the sense that it was silly . really quite silly . i must admit that i must agree with the reviewer that said if you are eating an entire plate of french fries , or freedom fries , depending , and you do n't know that you are eating something that is going to put some pounds on , then reading this book is n't going to help you . it does kind of sound like the positive reviews are all written by people that know the author personally . sounds a little bit like the pentagon 's planted news stories in iraq if you do n't mind my saying
