worst book i have read in a long time ! i have never read a danielle steel novel , but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through europe last week so i picked it up out of sheer boredom . the grammar is atrocious , and the repetitiveness highly irritating . how many times do sasha and what 's his name need to break up and get back together ? how often does sasha need to cry about this artsy guy ? this book was so annoying that i had to literally put it down and stop reading it . i will never pick up another danielle steel book , and i am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published !
