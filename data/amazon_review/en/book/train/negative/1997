lack of examples and horrible explanations make a ghastly diffe text because the guy who initiated the project of writing the book is here at rice , the rest of us are unlucky enough to have to use this book . if your class uses this book , prepare to go to class . all the time . that 's because if you fall behind , the book does not do a good job of explaining things to you . examples are generally vague and only apply to a few types of problems provided at the back of each section . a lot of the time , i 'd find myself stumped on a problem , looking back , and realizing there was no example problem for me to get ideas from . yes there are lots of problems and that 's good , in a way . but what 's the point of having all those problems if the book never teaches you how to do them ? furthermore , it is a poorly written book . generally , reading through the book is like searching for a needle in a haystack . literally speaking . you spend all that time figuring out what the authors talk about and once you figure it out , it was not even worth all that time . so go to class . all the time . if the prof isnt that great , get yourself another workbook . i havent seen schaum 's but i 'm pretty sure they 'll do a better job on covering the topics than this text does
