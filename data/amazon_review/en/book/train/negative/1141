disappointed after reading the oprah pick , `` what looks like crazy on an ordinary day , i was very disappointed in `` some things i never thought i 'd do . '' it took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and i lost interest after about the first fifty pages . i do n't think pearl cleage is a paticularly talented novelist ; i think she can write realistic , sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters , but the story is lacking . i loved the very first part of the book where regina burns has just gotten out of rehab , is losing her anscestral home , so she goes to her aunt abbie for help and comfort and abbie introduces regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause -- that is the story i wanted to read . instead , what i got is a very political story infused with the author 's belief that black men especially need positive role models . i believe we all need to be and have positive role models , that it is not just a black thing . i wanted to read more about regina and blue . i felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed . i hope that pearl cleage 's next novel is better than this one , but i 'm sorry to say i do n't hold out much hope
