some textbook ! this is the longest textbook i have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that . i know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations , but the book was too detailed and wordy for me . many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding . but this book does n't do that . it is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise , straightforward text . a really good book is investment science , by david luenberger . although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory , the writing , examples , and organization is far superior . you 'll actually begin to understand how investment really works , without getting bogged down by the numbers , terminology , and jargon
