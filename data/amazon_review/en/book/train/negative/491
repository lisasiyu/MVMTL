unbelievable i have read every one of stephen king 's books . this was the only one that i have not read . i have struggled to get to page 105 and i have no clue as to what is going one . the style of peter straub stinks . do n't waste your money , you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about . stephen king has finally written a real clunker . this may be the worst book that i have ever tried to read
