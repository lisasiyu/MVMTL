i quit the series ... and i want my spent hours of reading back title says it all . i enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series . forth book sort of dragged . by the middle of this book i had to make a decision ... keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel . let 's face it , life 's too short . if you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of `` the stand '' . i 'm afraid this does n't do it . think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers ? cheer
