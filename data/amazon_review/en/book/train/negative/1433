escape , travesty and a waste of money ! this novel is a travesty and should never have been published . i am so sorry that any of my money went to a company , coronet , that would render such a great author 's work into a chopped up mess . read whirlwind , it is great and essentially you will get two books for one if you believe that escape is one unto itself ( i obviously do n't ) . i was expecting further elaboration upon the story line of azadeh and erikki but it is just each section that pertains to them chopped out of whirlwind and put into a separate novel , butchers !
