buy the 2006 i think it 's disgusting the lack of research yale daily news put into this 2007 guide . there are a hundred things wrong with this guide , but just from opening to the school i go to ( university of delaware ) , and seeing that one of the things i have to do before i graduate is `` go to the stone balloon , '' i could tell this book was just a new cover to the 2006 with updated admissions statistics . the stone balloon , a historic university of delaware bar and music hall , announced more than a year ago that it was going to be knocked down and replaced by condiminiums on main street . this was true , and it was closed for the spring , and camera crews were there at the beginning of the summer to see huge bulldozers knock it over . pretty sad that no one will be able to fulfill the insider 's guide 's instructions . sweet life yale ... do some research and stop making money reprinting the same `` best-selling '' book each yea
