reviewer i am interested in succint yet exhaustive/substantive coverage of the topic for use in real-world corporate finance applications . i found the book to be verbose and not sufficiently to the point . the author peppers a few key insights in endless dialogue , which i find a bit tiresome . the text could be better organized to highlight key points and provide greater substance and less fluff . definition of terms could be far better written even for an introductory text . i suspect i am the wrong target audience
