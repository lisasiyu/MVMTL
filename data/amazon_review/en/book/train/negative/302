only for first year , if u are doing indepth o-chem then this isnt it mcmurry is a colourful and over-generalized textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic . mcmurry 's style is to induce learning of 0-chem via memorizing of reaction mechanisms , and other trivial components . the only reason you should buy this book ( same reason i did ) is if your o-chem course is based on this ; that being , this is your prescribed text . it is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook . however this may not be the case for this edition of mcmurry . organic chemistry by wade has the same chapter format , covers essentially the same thing but treats the fundamental principles with more depth ; allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry . one thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for ir frequencies of major functional groups , and mass spectra is barely covered . it is at best just mentioned ... nothing more . wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth ... something which is essential in second year chemistry . all in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics . when it discuses kmno4 oxidatation , that at least should be a review of redox . the chapters on substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory , but it is the basics that are lacking . i would suggest for first time o-chem students to consult wade and compare it to the writing style of mcmurry . albeit mcmurry is very nice and colourful , you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry . the book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in australia , which suggests the severe lackings of this book . this has been inherent in it for the last three editions ... not too happy with it
