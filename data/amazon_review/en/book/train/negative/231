only for suckers who would read all these reviews , and then actually buy this book ? this book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population ... the suckers ... of which i am obviously one , because i did read the stupid book ! it took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before i would fall asleep each night . if it was n't for jordan , i 'd have a hard time going to sleep at all . it does n't even deserve 1 star
