full of errors ! great idea for the book but spoiled by incorrect facts and explanations on almost every page ! thus it is good if you use it for the questions but not the answers . someone ( wish i had the time ) needs to list all the corrections on a website ( just a suggestion ) for this book to be fully utilised - until the author can correct the mistakes . ( if someone gets the website off the ground , i will gladly contribute correct answers ) having said this , i am still glad i got the book for the questions and to be pointed in the right direction . if only the author would correct the answers ... . gavin atp
