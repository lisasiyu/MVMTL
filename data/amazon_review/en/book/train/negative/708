did not work for me . i have been a big fan of mr. woods since `` white cargo . '' his books are not great literature , but fun reads with interesting characters and the outcomes are never obvious . this book fail in that i was not able to relate to the characters , too much sex with nothing to do with the story ( i am not against sex but it should be relevant , not sensationalistic ) . well , you cant hit one out of the park every time . if you like woods still of writing and storytelling you need to check out the cult favorite `` tourist in the yucatan '' cool thriller
