crushingly disappointing would the woman writing under joyce carol oates ' name these days please return america 's greatest living author to us ? seriously , this was the most unenjoyable , in fact most distressingly bad , book by oates i 've read , among the maybe thirty i have had the utmost pleasure to read . i do n't know what vein oates is tapping to construct these writings but the prose does not sound like her at all , the stories themselves are unimpressive , unwelcoming , unpleasantly centered on people who do not merit consideration . and worse still , i find this is a trend with oates these days . i ca n't think of a single book she 's published since middle age that has been ( yes , strictly in my opinion ) any good . the short story in female of the species that was called `` madison at guignol '' was perhaps the worst oates story ever published . ( and yes i do understand the connotation of the word `` guignol '' in the title . ) some might accuse me of approaching oates with preconceived notions and then recoiling when she fails to deliver what i , myself , wanted , but that 's not the case . one thing i have always applauded in this author is her chameleon-like ability to cross genre boundaries and create tales so divergent in theme and tone that they could have been the opus of a half-dozen different people . i have avidly read along thru gothic stories , mysteries , romances , non-genre pieces , novellas , poems , short fiction , novels , literary criticism and plays by oates , and so i believe i can fairly say i do not stereotype joyce carol oates or expect any one thing from her , but in this case , as much as reporting it pains me , this was a bad book and i can only hope oates bucks the trend and reaches back into the well of talent the world knows she has , and that her next book ( s ) will be much better
