similar stories crush this collection having enjoyed russo 's pulitzer prize winning novel `` empire falls , '' i was eager to give something else of his a try . maybe i should have selected one of his earlier novels instead because `` the whore 's child , '' interesting title aside , becomes tired and repetitive very quickly . the themes are the same in each story : aging male professor with an itchy prostate faces a mid-life situation , usually involving his younger second wife . that may sound too specific to relate to all of the stories in this collection , but you would be disappointed to realize that it is very accurate . the lone exception , and the novel 's best story , is the titular work about a nun who is , in point of fact , a whore 's child -- and the discrepancy between the generations makes for a poignant story . and yet , even that one includes a male professor character who is teaching the nun in his creative writing class , so similarities remain . despite that , the story is great . the rest ... well , if russo had done away with the other six achingly similar stories and expanded them into a single novella the book would have been much better . russo is certainly capable of spinning a great yarn , and the themes are fine if a little familiar ( russo seems to be an author that excells in that domain ) . i just think you would do better to stick with the format best suited to his talents : his novels . i know that i will from now on
