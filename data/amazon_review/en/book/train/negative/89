overstated `` help '' book although i am not a veterinarian , i have worked in an animal hospital for two years . first of all , according to our medical practice , this book gives some bad nurishment advice ! milk ( and milk products such as cream and half & half ) are not a good food for many cats . their systems are often not equipped to digest the enzymes found in cows ' milk . having said what was foremost on my mind , i am also very disappointed in the `` behavior '' advice from this author . i found very little information on kittens ... ..and almost nothing useful ( which is why i purchased this book in the first place ! ) . in fact , i absolutely disagree with ms. wilbourn 's suggestions about introducing a new kitten into an adult cat home . from the new kitten arriving via `` escort '' to you ( as the responsible owner ) and leaving the new kitten to fend for itself all afternoon , as your adult cat `` takes care of himself and his kitten '' . what dangerous nonsense this is ! stop and think ... ..what a 10 lb . adult could do to a 2 lb . kitten , if so inclined ? perhaps the cats in manhatten are far more anthropomorphisized ( as opposed to ms. wilbourn 's coined word `` catsonality '' ) then the felines with which the rest of us are familiar ? for the record , i currently have a terrific 15 year old , as well as a very feisty 4 month old . i should have seen warning signs when this 224 page ( large print book ) began with a 19 page forward . no doubt this forward is intended to demonstrate ms. wilbourn 's considerable knowledge . sorry , it does n't . bottom line ? save your money and try another author ... .preferably someone with the letters d.v.m after his or her name
