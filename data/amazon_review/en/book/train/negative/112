a book about what overconfidence can do to a person . i really do congratulate bill rancic for being hired by one of the richest man in the world . but being hired does not mean that bill rancic just became the next bill gates or warren buffet . great to know that you take yourself very very highly mr.rancic . your going to fit fine in the trump organization , but seriously dont over do yourself . i 'd rather retake my 'x100 intro to business administration ' class in my college than to buy this book
