great premise , unfulfilled , but not for lack of pages i read this after enjoying iles ' `` footprints of god '' quite a bit . this is his first work and thank goodness he has since learned to be more concise . the book is lengthy , and repeats itself quite a bit ( due , i assume to the length and complexity of the plot and characters ) . several characters could 've been cut out entirely - they were in long enough to kill and be killed , but did n't add anything to the story . intriguing characters , too - he could 've saved them for their own stories . after wanting to get to the end for the last 200 pages , i found the ending itself rushed . all loose ends were wrapped up very conveniently and in ways that did n't pay off for the investment of time required to get that far . there were some aggravating teases , too . when the israeli finally gets to confront the nazi for the question of `` why ? '' ( regarding the anti-semitism ) , i was really hoping that iles would 've ventured a reply - anything to try and give the nazi character some depth or plausibility other than just pure hate for the sake of hate . nope - he put the question out there and did n't try to answer it . that 's what i was hoping for - replace some of the graphic violence with real explorations of the underlying themes and how this fanaticism really survives - not just giving example after example of how it 's manifested . all that being said , the last page of the epilogue is brilliant , and in it , i found a simple yet profound statement that struck a chord .
