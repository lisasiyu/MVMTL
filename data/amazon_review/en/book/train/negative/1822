great idea , but the book did n't quite pay for itself this book had quite a number of scholarships listed , but some of them were of no use to 99.9 % of the population of college students . if i was interested in attending generic college , usa , and i wanted to know what scholarships they offered , i would go to that college and ask them . i would n't look it up in a general college scholarship book . thus it was frustrating when college-specific scholarships were listed for some schools , but not all . some of the listings were outdated , and i felt like i had to read through the whole book to make sure i did n't miss any scholarships i was eligible for . i sent out about ten letters to different scholarship opportunities , and not all of them were responded to , and of those that replied and to whom i submitted applications to , no money was won . thus i was not very happy with my purchase
