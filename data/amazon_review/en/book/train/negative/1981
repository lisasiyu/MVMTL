did not engage my 10-year-old this was required reading for my son going into fifth grade . he is not a strong reader , and neither he nor i enjoyed it . the combination of a large amount of flowery language and very little action made it a struggle to get through . what little humor there was , was too sophisticated . it was hard for us to identify with this foppish married mouse who ate caviar and champagne . while i can appreciate that many ( i guess most ! ) find it literary and delicious , my son found it boring , and looking at it through his eyes , i have to agree
