brilliantly written . having lived in the author 's home for two years while in new york i am biased towards this niche masterpiece . although my interests are on opposite sides of the map in relation to this book i had the privilege to witness , first hand , the author 's diligence and perseverence in putting the finishing touches on his textual opus . in this book mr. gauch brings his statistical mastery with him in his endeavor to reconcile science , philosophy and religion in the public arena . in so doing he greatly enables scientists to become better at what they do by examining the foundations of the scientific method . this book is a must read for students of science and scientific professionals alike
