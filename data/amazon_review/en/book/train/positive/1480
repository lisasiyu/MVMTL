good book i love the alice books even though sometimes they shock me with their content to be honest . i have read about 6 of these books and i go out of order because i ca n't always find the ones i 'm looking for . i read `` including alice '' before this and thought it was n't that great ; this one was much better . there is comedy , irony , heart break and some happy moments too . alice and her friends are very much like a lot of teens that i have come in contact with . i was pretty sad about her break up with patrick although i knew they were broken up already . i really think they are each other 's first loves but i doubt they will end up together in the end . most teen romances just do n't work out .
