as important today as when it was written i read this book last year . i was born during the vietnam war and remember little about it . i certainly did not experience the build up before the war . the ugly american had a tremendous influence on american foreign policy back then . it highlighted our arrogance and our vulnerabilities when we forget the importance of understanding other cultures . and president kennedy practically made it mandatory reading for his advisors . what was most interesting to me , however , was how pertinent the book is today . instead of sarkhan or vietnam , the book could be about iraq . regardless of your feelings about the war , the ugly american is enlightening and should remind us how important it is to understand others when we occupy their nation . the book is a short -- but important -- read . i recommend it to everyone . it is a classic not so much because of its language or story . it 's a classic because its message is meaningful even in today 's world
