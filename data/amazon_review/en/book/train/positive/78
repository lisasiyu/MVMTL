favorite book of all time i realize that reviews are wholly based on interpretation and opinion and i respect that . but i do n't get people who do n't like this book . no offense . that being said ( or written , in this case ) , i loved this book . i found it entertaining , odd and hugely funny and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh . my grandmother would n't get this humor , so if you 're her , do n't buy it . everyone else -- go for it .
