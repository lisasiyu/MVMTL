why i 'm buying this book so i 'm sitting in a west village cafe opposite a beautiful young writer , and she 's friends with a guy named eli cooper who seems to be living a dream life as a children 's book author . he 's just written his first non-watercolor-painted book on fatherhood , she has it , and do n't i want to check it out ? i do n't know if i do . will i be jealous of his writing ? should i trust this review by this other guy ? parenthood is n't something i 'm rushing into . even a book about it raises my heartbeat . ( i 'm married but childless . for now . ) reading the first two chapters floors me instantly . this is not at all what i expected . how do you make fresh what so many other people have tried to write ? well , this elisha guy succeeds . mr. cooper writes with such a natural tone it 's like listening to an old friend just kind of chuckling over the phone . at the same time , his observations are sharp , cutting , and hilarious . this is the good stuff . i 'm buying it . go get it !
