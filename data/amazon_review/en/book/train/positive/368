the big bam bashes the big one ! it 's hard to begin to praise leigh montville 's biography of baseball 's greatest slugger ever . there 's a prelude written in a 'foggy , ' uncertain-of-detail prose style which deals with the young george herman ruth 's being committed to a 'boy 's school , 'and then drops into a dead-accurate lowdown which montville researched diligently , right down to the brothers and young 'nigger lips 's ' discovery of the game and his rapid mastery . montville tells true stories about the babe 's slugging , eating , drinking and sexual prowess in sometimes drop-deadpan humour , and he 's a hell of a sportswriter as well . three cheers for montville and the babe ! ! ! ( but hey , who hit a lifetime .371 ?
