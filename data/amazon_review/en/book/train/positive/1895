& quot ; i have flown , father . my son , i believe you. & quot ; baltasar and blimunda is a wonderful , richly detailed account of life in early 18th century portugal . it is a time when portugal fought the ruthless french , maintained an important colony in brazil , and was constantly under the threat of the holy inquisition . the king of portugal , dom joao v , desperately wants an heir to the throne . one night he promises a franciscan friar that if he can foretell a succession to the throne then he would build a convent in mafra . after the queen gives birth dom joao v fulfills his promise by building a convent that is destined to be the greatest in portugal . meanwhile , after losing his hand on the battlefield baltasar travels to lisbon where he eventually meets blimunda while watching public executions of condemned individuals . an eccentric padre bartolomeu lourenco recruits baltasar and blimunda to work in secret creating passarola , a flying machine that resembles a giant bird . centuries before the modern airplane is created , the act of flying is often beyond the comprehension of individuals and could be seen as a holy sign . the sections of this book detailing the plight of passarola are most entertaining and fun . this creates a good balance with the harsh details of the building of the convent . saramago succeeds in writing entire passages revealing how much work and sweat were involved in such acts as dragging a giant slab of marble a considerable distance . one might think these passages are dull and tedious , but i believe saramago highlights these arduous aspects of life that are often ignored by other authors who create works of historical fiction . throughout the years saramago has solidified his reputation for being a wonderful storyteller who create novels that are both shocking and revealing of the human condition , and bastasar and blimunda is no exception . highly recommended
