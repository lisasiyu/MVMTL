berg at her best range of motion was my third elizabeth berg novel ( talk before sleep and until the real thing comes along being the other two ) and i must say this is by far my favorite . i loved this book from the opening line to the finishing sentence . berg portrayed her title character , lainey , with great sympathy and passion for what she loved . i loved lainey all the way through the book and she remains my favorite fiction character . throughout the novel lainey is dealing with her husband being in a coma after a freak accident along with taking care of her two daughters and helping her neighbor cope with a failing marriage . i cried along with lainey and smiled at her happy moments the entire time keeping the faith that lainey 's husband would one day wake up along with her . for any fan of berg or any reader interested in a truly great book , i highly recommend range of motion
