guthrie captures the west and the end of an era the big sky is the first in a series of great western novels by a.b . guthrie . the story begins in 1830 as young boone caudill escapes his kentucky home for the plains and mountains of the west . he meets up with jim deakins , a pleasant country philosopher , early on his journey and finally the experienced mountain man dick summers on the keelboat trip up the missouri . i enjoyed deakins ' theological disquisitions . `` you ca n't beat god for bein ' picky . no , sir . if he catches you playin ' cards or sayin ' one swear word ... it 's to hell with you forever and ever ... even thinkin ' is mighty dangerous . as a man thinketh , that 's how he is , and to hell with him ag'in . why you reckon he gave us a thinker then ? ... god is some busybody . '' guthrie takes us up the missouri , a slow fight all the way , across the plains , into the mountains and back . he creates for the reader the palpable sense of the openness and wildness of the west . yet the book steps back from fully romanticizing the end of the mountain man era . the story is often disturbing , not the least in boone caudill 's quick and often brutal ways . highest recommendation for anyone interested in the american west .
