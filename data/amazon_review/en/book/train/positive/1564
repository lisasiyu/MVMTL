practical , yet somewhat naive this book teaches you the best way to make money in the markets = confluence of levels combined with price action triggers . he teaches you almost everything on the market 's technical behavior . the naive part is that he uses , in my humble opinion , old school indicators - like 50sma and 200sma . also , he relies on stochastics as an oscillator to show him overbought and oversold conditions . of course , i wish this were true but i think in today 's more volatile conditions - there should be more than that . so what does there need to be ? i do n't know , but let me tell you one important thing : just because you see tons of charts on his book with stochastics on overbought and then prices immediately pulling back , do n't let that fool you into thinking that 's how the market is _always_ going to behave . it 's an excellent primer because this is how discretionary traders should trade , simple yet effective , but sometimes i think it 's a bit too much on the simple side . 4/
