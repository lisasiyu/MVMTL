icy and exquisite this is a slim , lush novel set on fire island in the 1960 's , and written years before the plague of aids . its subject is the intoxicating , intimidating , seductive , and ultimately cruelly destructive hip gay demimonde : the ruling class there -- and its & quot ; subjects. & quot ; gifted and kind-hearted novelist-critic-memoirist-teacher edmund white 's first novel , and the one that got him noticed , then praised by nabokov and many others . it describes a lost world , but has much to say about the one remaining . beautifully constructed and definitely worth reading
