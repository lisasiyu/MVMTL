a point of view ... when i was born in 1945 , my mother , a german armed forces helper on the way from prague ( deep south ) up to an isle named `` ruegen '' ( in the very north ) , in the middle of her long journey through a breaking down germany : she came down with me and , after one day in hospital , she stuffed me away into a children 's home ( in a town called `` wuppertal '' , west-germany ) - and left me to my fate . so she robbed me ( among others ) the experience of a childhood in the gdr , german democratic republic , `` wuppertal '' should be `` west-germany '' ( american sector ) , the isle of ruegen became russian sector , behind the `` iron curtain '' . so i did not learn anything about `` young pioneer meetings '' , socialism , communism , stasi ( the secret police ) or summer camps of young `` pioneers '' . in the western hemisphere i grew up , drinking pepsi coke , receiving american care packages , later on : listened to the beatles , noticed the students movement in 1968 , had no ulbrich or honecker , but chancellor willy brandt and helmut kohl . but i tried to find out the place , where the woman could live , who had born me in that dark year 1945 . after 40 years of persistent search , 1985 , before the berlin wall fell ( 1989 ) , i found out : she was living behind the `` iron curtain '' on the isle of ruegen . and i started to look at this lost childhood , which i did not enjoy : she showed me her photo album : summer beach near `` kap arkona '' at the north-point of the isle , snowy winters on hiddensee , flight ducks , cranes - but on the other hand coal heaps on washed-out sidewalks . color films ( orwo ) , books , trabi substitute parts : only hard to get . nevertheless , i wanted to make up for my life in the gdr - in 1990 when the berlin wall was fallen : a schools inspector on the island pointed into a corridor , filled with former stasi employees ( security police ) and informed me in this manner in an almost dumb `` cadre conversation '' , he unfortunately ( thanks to the `` reunification '' of east and west-germany ) would have to hide many people in the teaching profession now ( in hastiest kind ) . i should return please to west-germany , where i just had come from . the direction of my journey seemed to be absolutely atypically , out of character , and not recommendable . no `` ossi '' ( vs. `` wessi '' ) - no job . as a result my mother , noticing , that all her dreams collapsed , joined an acute epidemic disease at that time : she committed a so-called balance sheets suicide . i was deprived of the chance to become a `` zone child '' a second time . did i miss really much ? because the book of jana hensel has stimulated me to these thoughts - maybe her sometimes nostalgic `` ossi '' writings ( of course very different to my `` wessi '' -point of view ) are not as superficial , simple , banal , as i thought in the first moment ? compare her point of view ..
