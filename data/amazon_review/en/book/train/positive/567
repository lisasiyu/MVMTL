boot camp i read making the corps by thomas ricks a long time ago . this is the classic u s marine corps recruit yellow footprints/boot camp/drill instructor/obstacle course/rifle range story . you ca n't put the book down . even if you know the story , it is good to hear it again . buy it . lately , the quality of the writing of marine corps literature has climbed . this book should be sold with one bullet away : the making of a marine officer by nathaniel fick . fick gives us the story of the training a marine officer candidate receives at quantico . fascinating reading . fick tells a story that is often hinted at in other books but is rarely told . if you have only one of these books , then you must buy the other . these two books are classic marine corps literature . they are both required reading in the marine library
