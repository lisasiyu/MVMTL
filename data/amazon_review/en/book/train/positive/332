choices this is a fascinating , entertaining , short read about a group of travellers who take a bus excursion from hell into a place where they are given a chance to go into heaven . surprisingly , they actually seem to prefer hell . this is not a book about what heaven is like or what hell is like . it 's about people like us , and our choices , and how they affect our lives as eternal beings . reading the dialogue as heavenly beings try to convince them to come to heaven , i found myself trying to keep track of who was the `` right '' person and who was `` wrong '' , because the way the hell-people were talking was just the same way i talk ! of course , they seemed so stupid to me because i was on the heaven side of the book . but it reminded me of a quote from the movie the truman show ( paraphrased ) : `` i think what bothers you is that truman prefers his cell . '' these people lived in hell ( and that description is interesting too ) and they would rather go back there than swallow the pride that had made them reject god in the first place . one of lewis ' easier reads , for people who find him difficult to follow
