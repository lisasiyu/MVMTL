great primer on practical utilization of your intuition ms. peirce has written a well organized approach to seeing your intution as a valuable tool , not just a once-in-a-while whimsy . a trained intuitive herself , penney peirce is full of encouragement as well as clearly laid out exercises to allow one to hone their intuitive skills and incorporate the benefits into daily life . i would recommend this book to those embarking on their first inward journey ( no matter at what age ! ) . there are abundant benefits to the practice she outlines in this honest and heart-felt presentation . again , asking that question of mastery : how do you get to carnegie hall ? practice
