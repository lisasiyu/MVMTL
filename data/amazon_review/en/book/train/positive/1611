try this without sound or sub-titles yes , i have seen seventh seal many times , and it is , indeed , stark . the other night i watched the new criterion dvd i was gifted with the lights out , the sound off and volumes one and two of coil 's 'music to listen to in the dark ' popped in the stereo . i mean , once one has once seen seventh seal , there is nothing to the plot . ( i wo n't say that of the dialog because i do n't speak swedish . ) it 's like oedipus rex . this is a swedish movie . everyone in it looks swedish . ( even death ) . death is beyond anything from bill and ted , yet ( without seventh seal ) would we even have bill and ted ? i just like to watch these swedish people talk . perhaps the longest scene in the movie is shot on a beach , the horizon at mid-screen , and the entire top of the screen contains a horse , stamping , moving about , never still for but a moment . it is imagery that takes your breath away . as an image it is more than i could ever hope for , incomprehensible and compelling . add max van sydow , and , well , whatever ! it 's not a movie that you should intend to understand . it 's just beauty to watch and think about later . maybe always
