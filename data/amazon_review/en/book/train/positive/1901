conrad 's greatest novel nostromo is simultaneously a great political novel and a great psychological novel . a large part of conrad 's achievement is his fusion of these 2 elements into one seamless narrative . nostromo describes the penetration of a latin american country by european/north american capitalism and the ensuing revolution . all the characters in nostromo are engaged in the intensely political acts carrying the plot forward . conrad based his narrative on a considerable amount of research on contemporary latin america and the articulation of the plot elements is elegantly realistic and gripping . the psychological elements concern characters ' motivations for their acts . a recurrent ironic theme is that important characters are driven to act by motivations that have nothing to do with political objectives or economic gain per se . unlike most of his other novels which offer a psychological portrait primarily of a single character , nostromo features several characters whose motivations and actions are explored by conrad . the focus shifts from character to character is a way that consistently advances the plot , a brilliant piece of formal construction . finally , nostromo features some of conrad 's best descriptive writing . because of the complexity of the plot and characterization , nostromo is not the easiest of conrad 's novels to read . nostromo is ultimately well worth the effort expended
