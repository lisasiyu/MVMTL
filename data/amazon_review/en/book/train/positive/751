miller 's finest work to date ! `` decomposition '' is by far j. eric miller 's best work yet . his `` animal rights and pornography '' collection of short stories was only a glimpse of his truly remarkable storytelling . with `` decomposition '' we see miller at his best . the story 's pace never falters as the reader is pulled into the mind of the tale 's protagonist without ever wanting to look back . this was a great read ! i definitely recommend this book ! ck gaunt
