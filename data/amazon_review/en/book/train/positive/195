breathtaking i do n't know how i missed this jewel until now , but i 'm glad i finally found it . i have n't been this moved by a work of fiction in a long , long time . i found myself so drawn to charlie and to what was happening to him , to his longing for acceptance and love , and to his quest to make sense of his world . the desire for acceptance and love -- from oneself and from others -- is something all people have in common regardless their iq . i cried as charlie regressed , all the while knowing what was happening to him , realizing the profundity of his loss , yet finally being grateful for the short period of intellect and what that contributed to science . i ca n't disagree more with the reviewer who says the book 's ending was predictable . for a while , i thought the book would be about the trick of combining great intellect with human love . when fay put the female mouse in with algernon , i kept waiting to see if this theme would be played out , first with the mouse , later with charlie . one possible ending would have been to let charlie have his high iq but , unlike algernon , be able to integrate intellect with emotion . another ending would have been to go back to the lower iq , and have a completely sterile existence devoid of anyone . this of course did not happen as the people at the bakery also showed growth by the book 's end and were able to truly take charlie in and befriend him . i think the author came up with a good ending by causing charlie to lose the intellect , but to have gained self-love and the love of others , things he did not have at the start of his journey .
