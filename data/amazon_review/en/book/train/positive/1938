from a teacher 's perspective while i agree that this is not a text that delves deep into the theories of lacan or derrida or fish or any of the others , it is not intended to do so . i have found it to be an excellent tool for introducing my high school advanced placement students to the world of literary criticism . certainly some of the articles can get wordy or bogged down in `` technical '' detail , but literary criticism has never been for the reader who wants to skim and get the assignment `` over with . '' any critical theory takes time and patience to work through ; critical theory questions ideas and requires a commitment on the part of the reader to think , question , and engage with the text . there are some essays that younger students simply do not have the skills for yet but there are others that are quite accessible to them . in particular , my students found the essays on representation , structure , race , and canon very interesting . this source has one significant advantage over many other texts . for each article , there is an immediate application of the technique to a well-known piece of literature . i know that my students reading of appiah 's essay on race dramatically impacted how they interpreted shakespeare 's play othello and then later schuyler 's novel black no more . while neither my students nor i always agree with what the critics are saying , i have found the book a great starting point for discussion
