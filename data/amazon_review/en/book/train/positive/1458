great women 's history not only the legal status but the personal outlooks of women changed immeasurably in the period this book covers ; the subtitle speaks of space and power , but deutsch has also given us a fine overview of intellectual change : what women thought , and why they thought in those ways , during an era of astonishing industrial and social development . through her research , we can see why the women of henry james were not the same as those of f. scott fitzgerald -- and they were very different . we are used to sympathizing with the plight of working class women , and giving great credit to the founders of the settlement houses and political groups that helped them , but until now i had never realized how class differences affected attitudes , and how perfectly reasonable women of either set found great difficulty in understanding how those of the other thought and felt . this book has helped me get a better understanding of both groups . in recent months i 've been reading heavily in boston history and in women 's history of this period . this book is far and away the best thing i 've found . having done historical research using primary sources , i can tell you this author has done an immense amount of work , and it has paid off . she uses not only the minutes of meetings and legal reports , but personal letters and contemporary novels to tell the story . she writes clearly , and the book is well organized . if you want a real feel for the lives of women during a period of tremendous change , this book is the best place i know to get it . deutsch straightens out a lot of misconceptions , and helps to clarify an extremely complex period .
