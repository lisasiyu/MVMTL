blown away by the audio version this is my first full-blown experience with virginia woolfe . i was always a bit too impatient , skimming over paragraphs of internal dialog to get to the plot . what a difference an amazing narrator makes ! yes , it is slow going at times , but the beauty of woolfe 's sentences make the focus on every word worthwhile . leishman treats woolfe 's words as poetry , and i started thinking of them as that . for that reason , i disagree with the reviewer counseled against ten minute spurts -- at least in the audio version , the prose seemed so rich that it was hard to absorb more than a few minutes at a time . it was only when i began to savor each paragraph on its own that i could truly enjoy this work . this book is truly profound . it has caused me to become more aware of my own inner life , and has changed the way i think about what it means to `` know '' another person . highly , highly recommended -- and this is from someone who spends a lot of time reading trashy chick lit and thrillers !
