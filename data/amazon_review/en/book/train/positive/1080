theatrical skullduggery penelope fitzgerald is at her most devilishly entrancing in this tale revolving around the london acting school run ( and i mean run ! ) by freddie , a larger-than-life gorgon whose will can not be resisted . fitzgerald has fun skewering the backstage pretentions , intrigue and petty jealousies of the london theater world of the early 1960s , but , clearly loving every seedy corner of it , she celebrates it with such gusto that you want to sign up on the spot for a season or two . that combination of wryness and fondness makes this short novel among fitzgerald 's most satisfying . and when freddie goes out looking for a pound or two , hang on to your wallets
