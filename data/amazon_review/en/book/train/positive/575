absolutely wonderful ! 1970s suburbian life style is the setting of this compelling novel . this story follows the lives and drama surrounding a small town where four beautiful girls try to break free of their strict parents in very sinful ways . the book is narrated by a small groups of boys who become bewitched and pulled into the drama of these young girls lives . i absolutely love this book it was so real and full of heart and sisterly honour . that may not sound so great to those who understand the kind of honour these girls have with one anothers but its a wonderful novel that isnt for the faint at heart . it hits hard into a common death and problem among young girls and young boys
