revolutionary i used to hate lap swimming but now i love it , and it 's because of this book . laughlin has reinvented swim instruction . he 's made it fun . he 's made it easy . and the resulting stroke is heaven . the exercises do take some effort and dilligence to master . but if you go slow do n't move on until you have mastered each exercise , as instructed , you 'll open up a whole new world of swimming enjoyment . i often feel like i 'm flying in the water . this former water buffalo now swims like a fish . note : there 's a brand new total immersion book being touted on the ti website , which i have n't read . you may want to look into that , instead . also , some reviews and ti suggest the dvd as the best method , but that was n't the case for me . in my case , it was the clear , detailed instructions in the book that made it happen .
