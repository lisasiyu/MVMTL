well done book , yet ... i enjoyed robert webber 's book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well . at a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the `` fate '' of the church in america . so much `` commodification '' has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be `` ecclesia '' ? although i agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church ( the lutheran church-missouri synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy - - - the church body which webber received his doctorate from ) , my question is are we truly called to `` change '' the church in order to meet the people where they are at ? i agree with his assessments yet i question the reasonings behind doing it . do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others , just because the culture would be more `` prone '' to come to the church ? or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture ? our self-centered culture always asks the question `` what does this mean for me ? `` , and this has been a active question in the church for sometime . i believe the question that we should be asking is how does god give meaning to me , or what do i mean to god ? our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the lord of the cosmos
