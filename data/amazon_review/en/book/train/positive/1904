beautifully written , even if it makes you squirm in places how can a book contain so many disturbing , even highly distasteful elements , yet remain so intoxicating and intriguing ? such things from a lesser writer and i would have thrown the book across the room . but with this one i could not . i was compelled . marquez is part poet , part magician . it is the only explanation i can find . and in spite of itself , this story leaves you with a feeling almost akin to reverence . reverence for romantic love even in very old age .
