an excellent classic this book is a beautiful story in so many ways - the strong , complex characters , and the history of a legendary part of the united states being just two of them . the world through the main character 's eyes is a world seen anew . the reader truly can feel raw intensity of early 20th century brooklyn , the challenge and joy of immigrant communities living together . i would recommend this book to anyone looking for an enriching and enchanting story .
