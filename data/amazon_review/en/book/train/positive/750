a wonderful book i read this book in one sitting , and when i was done i found myself going back through it again in order to digest it more completely . i really wish it had been available when i was just starting my family , but even though my kids are now older i do n't feel it 's too late . a wonderful resource for any two-parent household , full of practical advice and suggestions on how to improve the whole family 's quality of life . julie shields cuts through to the heart of many emotional , complicated parenting issues and presents solutions from a fresh , logical perspective . this is not just another book telling women how to reduce stress in their lives by making time for relaxing baths . i highly recommend it to any parent , or anyone thinking of becoming one
