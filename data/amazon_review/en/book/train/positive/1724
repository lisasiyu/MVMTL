championship ball by coach clair bee the book i read was championship ball , by clair bee . championship ball is about a high school basketball player named chip . chip is an extremely good athlete and is a starting basketball player for his high school . everything was going great until something happened that would change chips life forever . during a basketball game chip got tripped up and hit the ground hard . as chip was writhing in pain , the team trainer came out to assist him . as it turned out chip had fractured his ankle in several places . it was pretty bad which would mean that he would have to watch the games from the team bench for the rest of the year most likely . as his team goes on without him , they are doing quite well . they are making a championship run , and they are doing quite well , and they eventually get there . before the big championship game , chip was begging his coach to let him play . chip 's coach is not sure if chip is ready to play just yet , but chip is by far the best athlete on the team . will chip get to play in the big game , or will he have to spend yet another game spectating from the bench . i really enjoyed the book because it is very suspenseful , and it is hard to put down . it is suspenseful because throughout the book the author does not tell you chips condition in its entirety , and whether or not he will get to play in the up coming games . there was on thing that i did not like about the book and that is the repetitiveness . it seemed like every time a big game was about to unfold , the same thing happened on the court . also every time chip asked his coach to play , he always said no , so you kind of almost expect it . my strongest reason for recommending this book is that it is very well put together . also if you are into sports or you like suspense and action , then you will probably love this book because it has all of these aspects .
