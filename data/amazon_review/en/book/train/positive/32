lost in a great book ! i am an avid fan of lost and found this book to be a great resource , as well as a starting point for some new thought on the subject . there is a lot to keep track of in this tv series ( characters ' current lives on the island , flashbacks to characters ' previous lives , plot twists , philosophy . . .etc ) and the details that are catalogued in this book have been revelatory to me . having all those details laid out in front of me has helped me to think about my own and others ' theories on lost and make some interesting connections and even some dismissals . this book is for the thinking fan who wants an accessible resource and insightful discussion of an incredible series . i have also loaned this book to a friend who i wanted to get interested in lost , and she has found it most helpful and is now hooked on the series . there is also a section on fansites and blog resources that has been really fun to peruse . i have even run into one of the authors online and gotten to chat . very cool ! in short , this book has it all !
