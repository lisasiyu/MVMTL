good stuff ! quammen has compiled a thoughtful and entertaining collection of his essays for the boilerplate rhino . you do n't need to be a nature buff or of a scientific mind to enjoy what he 's written . this was a bit of an impulse buy due to a bargain price , but i was pleasantly surprised . i look forward to reading more of quammen 's work
