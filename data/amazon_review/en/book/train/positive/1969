country life as rehab after the brief period of time it took to read this tale , i 'm not surprised it found its way into my hands . this is not only a story i `` get , '' ( couple flees city for a life in the country ) it 's full of a self-deprecating and sarcastic wit i welcome when reading memoirs . jim mullen , a humor columnist best known for his `` hot sheet '' in entertainment weekly , portrays manhattan life as addiction . addiction , for example , to non-stop action , broadway plays , gallery openings , ethnic restaurants and the new york times . the symptoms include immunity to noise and smells , and they lead to chain-smoking and excessive spending at the sharper image . he 's hooked . it 's his wife , sue , who takes the lead and buys a farm three hours northwest of the city in the catskills , and drags him along for what turn out to be rehabilitative weekends . as the weekends grow from two days to five and then finally full time , he gives up smoking , takes up bicycling and then learns about everything from growing giant pumpkins to the inner workings of a septic system . one realizes he has come full circle when he describes a dewy spider web as the prettiest thing he 's ever seen and recognizes a `` flatlander '' in the garden store . while observing this newer version of the village idiot , he rolls his eyes and wonders if that 's how he was when he first entered ( the fictional town of ) walleye . the writing is original and funny , informal without being glib , irreverent without being vulgar . for anyone who enjoys well-written memoirs -- particularly those of the city-mouse , country mouse variety -- put this on your list . also recommend : `` fifty acres and a poodle .
