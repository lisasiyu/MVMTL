review of walt whitman 's `` leaves of grass '' this thick soft-backed `` pocket '' book has 490 pages . it could be called the complete whitman . it contains hundreds of poems . i am a senior citizen who had not read any whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much . his descriptions of the 19th century 's people , places , and inventions are eye-openers . he was actually a feminist before there was such a concept , and also an abolitionist . he truly believed in equality and democracy . he was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment . of course , there are parts i could quibble about , but that would be foolish . whitman was a man ahead of his time .
