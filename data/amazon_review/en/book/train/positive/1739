scholarly insights into the book of acts the late dr. f.f . bruce was a well respected biblical scholar and his commentaries and books have greatly benefited the church of christ . it is no different than with this work on the book of acts . this book falls in line with the rest of the new international commentary on the new testament edited by gordon fee . the nic is a solid evangelical commentary on the new testament with the differing opinions stated in the works ( see revelation for example ) . dr. bruce has gone to great lengths to point out the differences among evangelicals in acts . the commentary itself is full of greek word studies , historical and geographical points , maps , and solid exegesis of every passage in acts . my only drawback with this work on acts as well as the other works of the nicnt is that they are not laid out in expository outlines . it would be helpful if every section was given an expository outline to help the reader when moving through the sections of the scriptures that the authors are working through . for a better expository outline see the commentaries of john macarthur or john phillips
