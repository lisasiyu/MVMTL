nyt `` top 50 '' list this book is phenomenally crafted , written with heart and sincerity . i can not recommend it strongly enough . i learned about it through the recent new york times `` top fifty '' recommended list , which included several authors i 'd never heard of . frankly i was concerned that the list would have a couple of weak entries as happens . `` independence day '' reaffirms my faith in reviews , polls , awards ( pulizer ) and i 'm glad to know that this is just the second installment of an iconic series . to say the language `` independence day '' is poetic is an understatement . ford exercises control over both the vernacular and the estoric ( on average i did n't know a word every five pages , but that 's a good thing - the language is rich and sincere as is the engrossing narrative ) . the word `` angstrom '' appears in the book , perhaps a footnote to updike , who knows ? frank 's sale to the markhams is one of those protracted dramas , no , comedies , that weaves through like a wagner liefmotif . wait , that simile strikes the wrong key , because the markhams , as you get to know them , and you will , in richly parenthetical passages , represent everything you the reader and frank dislike about pure unadulterated dumbasses . ok , i can go on and on about this book , it 's subtleties , it 's heartwrenching passages about love and divorce , but no , go read it
