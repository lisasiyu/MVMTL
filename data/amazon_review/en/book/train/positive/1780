excellent book - helps design eai wisely reading a design patterns book for me is interesting when i find that nugget of coolness , the rest of the time it is plain boring . however , this book really keeps it interesting for the most part and still drives home the design points particularly around eai . i think it would make a great book for someone wanting to get into design patterns , which is important for anyone writing integration applications . also , it is a good all-around reference book for the serious and seasoned java programmer who needs to know how to design integration . i have gof , and i refer to this book more often from a practical standpoint
