and the beat goes on ... and the beat goes on ... there are several books out there filled with ginsbergs ponderings ( i 've looked at most of them ) ... so why pick this one ? for one ... this collection spans 48 years of a. ginsberg 's work . highlighting poetry that the author selected personally . sure here you will find the ever famous & quot ; howl & quot ; , & quot ; sunflower sutra & quot ; and & quot ; america & quot ; as well as , & quot ; elegy for neal cassady & quot ; which was written by ginsberg shortly after hearing of his long time friend 's death . however , where many of these sort of books highlight one particular phase the author has gone through ( like a gallery showing of only picasso 's blue phase ) this tome lets the reader experience the entire ginsberg . i highly suggest this book for anyone who is interested in getting to know ginsberg and in experiencing his greatness which spanned over 48 years ( longer then his friend kerouac was on the planet )
