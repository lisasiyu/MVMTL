great read you can read the other reviews to see what the book is about . fascinating stuff if you have any interest in psychedelics whatsoever . the long and short of it is that this book is a great read for being written by a doctor and medical researcher . i found it highly enjoyable . the story is as interesting as the research , and dr. strassman 's sincere account of the project 's difficulties and the personal toll it took on him made the book even more of a page-turner for me . note that a small fraction of reviewers here did not like it . what 's not to like ? the book has : a brief history of psychedelics a look into governmental drug-control bureaucracy fascinating stories of weird trips including contact with alien beings the occasional rogue test subject pissed off buhddists an unstable intern hilarious slogans like : `` you do n't come back from .04 an atheist '' and other fun stuff highly recommended reading .
