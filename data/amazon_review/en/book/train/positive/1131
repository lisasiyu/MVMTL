family favorite mrs. piggle wiggle was 'the nanny'/'dr.phil ' of her time . these stories offer parents and children interesting ways to deal with daily chores and struggles that can sometimes seem overwhelming . i enjoyed reading this book as a child and could n't resist purchasing it for my girls 4 and 2 to enjoy . we have been working our way through various childrens ' novels as part of our bedtime ritual . books like this are good for holding the attention of children at various levels of reading and reading comprehension . these stories have also served as a springboard for discussion in our family about finding creative new ways to accomplish the many tasks that need to be done to keep the household running . some of the material may seem dated , but it 's definetely a classic .
