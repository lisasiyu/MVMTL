samson returns ... in the post-communist world , the cold war espionage genre may seem a little dated . we have other concerns and fears on our minds now . but for reasons i 'll get to below , this novel series is a stand-out from that era , and still well worth reading . this book was actually written after the fall of communism , but the plot takes place a few years before it . in this book samson returns to work for london central and deals with a disastrous assignment in east germany ; an internal struggle to keep positions in a down-sizing agency ; etc . the book plot is interesting enough , but running alongside it are several series-length plots that continue to engross the reader : can bernard and his wife fiona rebuild their marriage after her apparent defection and return ? in fact , can fiona even recover from her ordeal ? what about gloria ? i just recently re-read the entire bernard samson series ( of which this is the seventh out of nine novels ) . it is one of the best novel series i have ever read , and certainly one of the best espionage genre series ever . there are so many things to like about this series - the in-depth characterizations ; the pithy observational asides about people and cultures ; the references to multiple languages and their subtleties ; the gritty european settings ; the hidden plot developments and character motivations that the narrator either ca n't or wo n't see ; etc . the author claims that each of these books can be read on their own , and perhaps they could be . but you can get a lot more enjoyment out of it if you start at the beginning with _berlin game_ ( or even better yet - start with the wwii prequel : _winter_ ) .
