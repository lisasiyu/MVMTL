definitive ... a wonderful addition to my library i purchased this book when it first came out . i thoroughly enjoyed it at that time , and have used it as a reference ever since . what so many do not realize is that different treatments ( distillation vs. tincture vs. absolute vs. hydrosol , etc . ) of a plant result in often very different properties comprising that substance . so finally having some insights into the properties of hydrosols , the water remaining from the distillation of a plant , is/was much needed . no other work like it had been available . and what a revelation about many of them . most people , even those working with essential oils and their cousins were not aware of what this or that hydrosol might do , let alone how to get their hands on it . really needed and really wonderful work
