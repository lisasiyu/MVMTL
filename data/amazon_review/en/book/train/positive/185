still worth reading 17 years later and many things have changed . the desire of investors to accurately gauge the stability of the companies in their portfolios remains the same . the incentive of management with stock options to hide the true nature of what the reality of what the company 's earnings have been remains strong . some of the techniques mentioned will be hard to use when companies employ spes to hide their true indebtedness and derivative positions mask the value at risk . however , many of the technique still have value . the analysis of receivables and inventories can provide insight into the immediate future of the company . the techniques that have lost their clear edge are the debt and write-off analysis . write-offs are now required by gaap ( although the `` big bath '' write-offs are still `` non-recurring '' ) and spes or variable interest entities can obscure debt . it is fascinating in light of enron , worldcom , qwest , tyco , and adelphia the stories of companies in the 70s and 80s that were attempting to do the same thing ( though often without the fraud ) . how little man changes through the ages
