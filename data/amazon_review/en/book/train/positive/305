mountain of life da chen 's rendition of memories etched within his heart is very descriptive . i especially like this passage : `` ... the thoughts tortured me and i squirmed in shame and humiliation , but i had to face reality . the teacher could throw me out with a sneer on his face . that was fine , i had thick skin . a poor child could n't afford to have thin skin . only rich boys and well-to-do girls with cute little butterflies in their hair could afford to have thin skin '' for a child of nine , to have such vivid memory of a childhood , is startling . the innocence and words crafted makes colors of the mountain , a reading worth investing time in . reading between the words give you an insight to how deep da chen 's spiritual values are . an amazing , funny and innocent book
