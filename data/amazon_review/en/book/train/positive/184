thrilling `` the andromeda strain '' may be an antique in science fiction , having been published in 1969 , but that hardly diminishes its excellence . the caliber of michael crichton 's research is such that i still found the technology and science in the book impressive ( though the computers were obviously dated ) despite the book 's age . the plotline is thrilling , and though some of the scientific and philosophic asides are lengthy , most are equally fascinating . i was slightly disappointed by the ending ; however , the rest of the book was amazing and made the reading worth it
