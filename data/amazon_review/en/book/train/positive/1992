the children speak finally , , this book was just what i have been looking for . i 've been diligently searching for information on how my lesbianism would effect my daughter and the sterile studies i found just did n't seem to satisfy my quest . i found comfort from this book and in knowing who she becomes depends on all the factors of parenting and not just the fact that i 'm a lesbian . this collection outweighs the studies because the honesty of the writers provided rare and precious information . i hope volume two is in the works and perhaps we will hear from some more artificial insemination babies . thanks to the writers and editors for letting these voices be heard loud and proud
