culinary and personal intrigue . this is the sequel to liquor , the first of the rickey and g-man mysteries . this one is more fun , and i believe , more finely crafted . there is less of the culinary aspect in this book , and more of the mystery-intrigue-new orleans corruption `` stuff ' , that makes these plots fun . rickey is his usual impulsive and volatile self , and g-man , ever steady and calming , evolves into a more complex and active character . lenny is there , but he does not occupy too much of the book . there are a few surprising `` twists '' in the plot , and if you are an astute reader , you will `` pick-up '' the clues . if not , and that is very ok , you will find the resolution to the story line fascinating , and quite frankly , plausible . i 'm looking forward to the `` 3rd '' in the series , if there is to be one
