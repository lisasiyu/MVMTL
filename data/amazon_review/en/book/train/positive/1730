memoirs of a memory i had my copy of memoirs found in a bathtub confiscated by my 9th grade french teacher in 1977 . hey , it was a 30 minute free reading period . i learned of kafka 's influences on this book , and their shared heritage , years later . searching for knowledge can be a treachorous endeavor . the authorities and experts ca n't always be trusted - especially when they no longer have paperwork to bolster their position
