laugh out loud on every page i had never heard of the borowitz report until a couple of days ago , when a girl in my dorm showed me this book . i opened it up to a random page and saw the headline `` bush may lack gene for human speech . '' i started giggling as i read the piece and by the end of it i was laughing hysterically . this happened again and again as i flipped through the book until i realized i was laughing out loud on every page . no book has ever made me done that before . ( as for my tv viewing habits , i am a huge fan of the daily show and this book is right up there with it . ) the book is based on a daily e-newsletter called the borowitz report which i have now signed up to receive every day . if the guy can manage to write columns each day that are as funny as the ones in this book , i do n't know how he does it . this book is at the very top of my list of recommendations . you wo n't be sorry you got it
