i found this book to be very helpful ... however , i read the book from first page to last . i found it very helpful and inspiring . i found myself talking out loud about situations that were familiar to me and debating things aloud as well . i would definitely recommend the book , however , i am wondering if there are any in depth books out there . i guess i am looking for rules , regulations , and suggestions in that area . i know that they , of course , vary by region , state , county , city etc ... . thanks ! ! tamm
