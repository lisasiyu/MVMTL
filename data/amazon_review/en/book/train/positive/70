loved it ! ! however ... ... i would have liked the hero 's character , diaz , to be developed a little more . he was dark , mysterious , and sexy but even his face was n't described very well . i could n't form an image in my mind of what he looked like , like i could with milla . the story , however , was awesome . i could n't put it down and my heart ached for milla . what a read . i would recommend it to anyone ! ! !
