about ship ! jolly captain jack aubrey and his sidekick the bespectacled bohemian doctor maturin return for this 7th book in the renowned aubrey/maturin series . in this segment , maturin and fem fatale diana viller 's romance heats up , jack 's money troubles become more pronounced , and doc maturin 's career as a spy threatens to become the death of him . what can i say about this great series ? the character of jack aubrey is just so endearing and doctor maturin is so priceless as the inscrutable doctor , that this series simply can not be missed ! even the presence of diana villers ( a character i 've simply loathed for quite some time ) , seems less irritating . i 'm listening to the unabridged narrated version by patrick tull , and this series is wonderful . can not be missed . particularly love the parts where jack/maturin and the swedish envoy are in prison . too funny ! wonderful series . i highly recommend it .
