solid book but a supplement not subsitute this is the best book on boxing i 've encountered . the author does a good job of explaining technique and providing drills for exercise . however , any book on boxing will be inadequate for learning how to box . good boxing skills ca n't be learned from a book - just the way you ca n't learn to dance well from a book . to physically know how to box you need a trainer and you need to get in the ring and spar . to master the techniques , it must feel right . you acquire that feeling by watching your trainer and having him/her correct your mistakes . you have to be physically next to that person ( anyone who 's learned to box or dance will tell you this is true ) . you polish those techniques and gain confidence in using them through sparing . yet the author does deserve credit for putting out a fine book
