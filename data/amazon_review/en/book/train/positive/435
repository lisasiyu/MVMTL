strong stories ; read by a fantastic actor ( paul winfield ) these stories , as read by the great actor paul winfield , are powerful testaments to life , love , hard times , etc.. these stories and their central character , socrates fortlow , are fine examples of a man , who did wrong , seeks redemption , and tries hard to make amends . the continuing theme of the crime which he committed ties them all together . mr. winfield 's reading cuts across all racial barriers , to teach all of us , black and white , about one man 's struggle ( s ) with his demons . his reading also adds passion and depth to mr. mosley 's writing . i 'd highly recommend these stories ( in audio and print ) . [ refers to the audio edition .
