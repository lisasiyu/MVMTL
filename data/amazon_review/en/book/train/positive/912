a beautiful book this set of articles , originally written for magazines and catlalogues , is one of the most eloquent collections of mountain writing i 've yet come upon . the book is divided up into chapters such as 'climbing with style ' , which features articles about `` the whole art of natural protection '' written at the the start of the clean climbing revolution , and 'further aborad ' which includes the authors account of a climb on ama dablam . one of the features i most enoyed about the book was the introductions to various historical figures such as smoke blanchard and royal robbins . and the memoir style accounts of what it was like for a small band of climbers to live in the mountains away from civilization getting their kicks out of the `` simple joys '' and living in bare subsistence , long before climbing turned into the popular sport which it might be called today . doug robinson is well qualified to write what he does , and his style is nice and clear without being base . most of it is written in an autobiographical style , dealing with developments on the climbing and skiing scene for wenty odd years . if you are partial to a bit of dharma bums then get this book . also anyone interested in the history of the sierra nevada
