something entirely different this collection of short stories was given to me by a good friend . with one or two exceptions , it concerns women confronting decisions - from the most mundane to the fairly serious . what sets these stories apart , in addition to the fine writing style , are the decisions made by these women . they are never politically correct or predictable . at times the reader may find the direction taken by the author to be controversial , even uncomfortable . i know i asked myself during several stories , `` now why the heck would she do that ? '' i suspect that was the point being made by the author and what is the ultimate joy of the book - to force the reader to accept each character as independent of any predispositions by the reader . the author uses sarcasm and more conventional humor where the average reader is least likely to expect it . she takes simple stories and sends them in unexpected directions . my favorite story in the collection was `` i thought you said you love me '' , perhaps because it was the most conventional . that said , `` model job '' was just as enjoyable , but most unconventional . treat yourself to something different and read `` inside out . '' the author is preparing to publish a volume of poetry , which should be a treat indeed !
