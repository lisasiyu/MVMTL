a great interesting book the great kapok tree is about saving the rain forest . first a man starts to cut down a tree in the rain forest with an ax . whack , whack , whack ! the sounds of the ax hitting the tree scared the animals . one by one they came down to where the man was , but the man fell asleep . a boa constrictor came down from the canopy of the tree and hissed in the man 's ear , `` senhor , this tree is a tree of miracles . it is my home , where generations of my ancestors have lived . do not chop it down . '' i liked this story because it is about the rain forest . the pictures were good , too .
