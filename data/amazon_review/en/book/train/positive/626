o'nan rights a wrong ... ... ... . stewart o'nan has corrected a major oversight by writing so comprehensively about a topic surrounded by myth and folk legend . apparently , the story of the hartford circus fire of 1944 has never been told in a book , but mr o'nan has dived into the deep end of the myths and legends and surfaced with a factual , well-researched , and eminently readable tale of the tragedy . covering all aspects of the fire and its ' aftermath , mr o'nan debunks the stories told as truth but bearing none , reveals new and unsung heroes , and lovingly examines the fate of little miss 1565 , the lovely , unclaimed child who lay so long in a grave with only a number to mark her presence . this is an exciting read , filled with the thrill of the circus , the horror of a fire out of control , the fate of survivors , and that of victims ... ... . both those who lived and those who did n't . while mr o'nan has moved on to the boston red sox in his book with stephen king , faithful , this was his first foray into non-fiction , and he has done himself proud . this is a great story , told well , and with care
