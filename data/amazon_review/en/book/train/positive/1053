a book of facts and not guess work george catlin is certainly a man to admire , as is this book.catlin lived amongst the native americans for many years and writes carefully of his experiences.this is an interesting read and provides another dimension to the subject of american indians.the book is fascinating in as much as catlin portrays himself as a wordly man and a friend of the indians ( and he certainly was ) but despite that you can still find evidence of his ignorance within the text.nevertheless he was a fascinating man who had a fascinating life , his artwork allthough basic in my mind , is well worth a look.my only critiscm of this book is that quite some time is spent describing the scenery whereas i would have prefered even more writing on the indians themselves , that is my personal viewpoint , others may find that intruiging.the book is full of facts and personal experiences and that in itself adds to the validity of this book as musthave for your collectio
