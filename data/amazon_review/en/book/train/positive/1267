codes nothing but a fluke ! just finished reading this book . what can i say ? this book seems to finally put the controversy to rest . phew ! what a relief , i thought i may actually have to start believing in god or something . this book is full of data and statistical analyses . it isn`t much like all the other bible code books out there , and i`ve read most of them . my favorite is cracking the bible code by j. satinover . this book ( dr. ingermanson ) is more scientific and gets down to the dirty work of disproving the codes scientifically . he calls himself a computer geek in his bio . and after reading his book i`d have to agree with him . he has a strange sense of humour as well , almost appeasing . great book and puts the debate to rest once and for all
