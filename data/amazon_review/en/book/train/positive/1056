strong family drama in england though she recently broke up with her boyfriend , seventeen-year-old charlotte feels good about herself and her future as she is doing well in school , lives in a relatively happy all female home , and seems adjusted . that is until she learns she is pregnant . her mom karen is a teacher 's aide struggling with her mother nan 's mind slowly slipping away with the demands from that side already overwhelming . her patience is over the edge when charlotte informs her she is pregnant . upset and unable to contain her anger , karen can not believe that history has repeated itself because when she was sixteen she gave birth to karen . though she loves her daughter all her dreams died with her birth . she did marry the father but thankfully divorced that loser soon afterward . as nan drifts deeper into the past including insisting that she adopted karen , the mentally exhausted sandwich generation is not sure what to do as charlotte decides to give birth except to flee in search of her biological mother dreaming of a loving comforting welcome . this fascinating character study is at its best when the audience sees deep inside the three generations with deep understanding of being an unwed mother , a child having a child , the sandwich generation , and the creeping of dementia ( as well as a late stroke ) . when the tale spins off into the biological mother twist it loses some of its depth until karen returns to her `` real '' family . somewhat a soap opera , the bad mother 's handbook is a strong family drama that focuses on the demands and responsibilities on women without men . harriet klausner
