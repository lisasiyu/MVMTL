good start to what promises to be a fun series wanda nell culpepper has got a lot on her hands : she 's a single mom with three kids and one grandkid who she works 2 jobs to support . her mother in law is a monster -- and her ex has just shown up waving around a lot of cash . when wanda nell finds her ex stabbed through the throat with a pink lawn flamingo , her troubles have just begun . the deputy suspects her , dangerous folks are coming after her looking for something that the ex supposedly left with her . `` flamingo fatale '' is a good read and an interesting cosy ; however , i do n't think that evans hits her stride with her first book . `` murder over easy '' is much improved and the third in the series actually promises to be more interesting .
