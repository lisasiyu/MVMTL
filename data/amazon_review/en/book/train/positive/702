a wonderfully twisted book . i 've read this book a few times , and it never fails to amuse me with its intricately woven stories , wicked satire , and twisted plots . perhaps it 's not everyone 's cup of tea ( as other reviews have shown ) but i loved the mix of 19th century convoluted plotting ( a la wilkie collins or palliser 's own quincunx ) and send-ups of modern literary theory , in the form of a literary critic cum cult leader , and such luminaries as jeffery archer , seen here as an egotistical politician turned plagarist . i am not a fan of books as puzzles , but this is no postmodern deconstruction of fiction ; it 's just a funny take on a thematically linked short story collection
