staple for designers i am thrilled with this book . it is clear , concise , and thorough . i 'm totally excited to make all the slopers to begin creating my own library of designs . content-wise the only drawbacks is that it 's mostly based on standard form sizes . they do give directions about how to measure the body and the drafting itself is pretty simply explained so either measurements can be used . also , there are n't instructions about collars or cuffs or button/zipper extensions which , granted , are not really necessarily drafted by measurements . but you do need a supplemental flat pattern making book for those items . the only real cons i can tell are the publisher 's fault - not the author 's . the book is rather skinny for the price - i too was expecting a monster text . should have known better - its a textbook right ? so of course they gouge the student . shameless really . on top of it , it is rather cheaply done - the pages look like photocopies ! also , one reviewer mentioned that it came with the neckline tool - i did n't get one ! now i have to scour the internet to find a replacement because they do n't have directions about how to draft a neckline . my only real annoyance .
