escape from reason this book is short and brief ( 100 pages or so ) , that is its intended appeal . it is not and does not claim to be a comprehensive analysis of all theological and philosophical thought -- just a very thoughtful and broad view of the impact of thought , art , industry , etcetera and its culmination on the state of our current society . to this end the book is fullfilling
