wonderful ronald l.davis ' study of the beautiful 'fox girl ' , linda darnell is one written with great kindness and respect to this most wonderful lady . this book does not delve into the trash and gossip that often is cruelly and unnecessarily found in film star biographies . davis looks at linda with a caring pen and writes about her fairly . although he writes about her personal troubles he does so gently with heart and understanding . he spent many hours interviewing her daughter charlotte , her sisters undeen and monte , her brother cal and numerous friends . this helps to give the book a personal feel that is not found in those written from archives and second hand news . i adored linda before reading this book and when i finished he cemented my adoration of the lady forever
