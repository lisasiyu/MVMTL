not as good as king leopold 's ghost , but still worth the read ... after reading king leopold 's ghost , i was looking for a good synopsis of what happened in the post-colonial era . after a few weeks of searching , i settled on in the footsteps of mr. kurtz . both were fascinating books that give great insight on the problems with the congo . both are written in a style that is highly readable , entrhalling and at the same time informative .
