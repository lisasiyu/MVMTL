engaging look at a scary set of diseases deadly feasts : tracking the secrets of a terrifying new plague by richard rhodes is one scary book . it tracks the discovery of prions , the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease , scrapie , and creutzfeldt jacob disease . following human cannibals in the jungles of new guinea in the fifties , bovine cannibals of the british isles in the eighties , and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the 17th century on , rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases . i especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists , from the noble laureate who so enjoyed the new guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation , yet brought thirty natives back to the usa and helped them through school , to the hyper-competitive scientist who named the molecules even though he was n't quite certain what they were . but this is n't just a story of scientific discovery . as the foreboding subtitle blares , rhodes explores some of the scarier aspects of prions . these include spontaneous formation , responsible for the known early cases of creutzfeldt jacob disease , trans-species infection , including mad cow disease and scrapie , the long long incubation period and lack of immune system response , and hardiness of the disease . one scary factoid : a scientist took a sample of scrapie , froze it , baked it for an hour at 360 degrees ( celsius ) , and was able to re-infect other animals from this sample . for all the uneasiness this book inspires , it certainly does n't offer any answers . a condemnation of industrial agriculture , a warning that it 's unknown whether vegetarians are even safe , and a caution against using bone meal for your flower garden do not make a recipe for handling this issue . to be fair , it was printed in 1997 -- perhaps things are under control now .
