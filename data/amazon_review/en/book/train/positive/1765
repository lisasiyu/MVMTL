keeps on ticking ... ... ... ... ... i bought and read this book many years ago and found it very helpful . i read it again a few weeks ago and was again able to appreciate it 's value . aside from the dated research , and some of the debate regarding the use of anti-depressants , it remains as fresh and powerful and relevant today as it was when it was published . it is definitely a giant step in taking the mystery out of depression and i would recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn more about the nature and treatment of this illness
