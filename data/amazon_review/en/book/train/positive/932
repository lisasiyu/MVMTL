brilliant the libertarian ideology and economic analysis is one of those things that is ruitinely ignored and was scorned in the 1970s and 1980s when economics was hijacked in the west by communists . however libertarians have offered a radical alternative that has rung true from time to time and is an important critique that deserves to have more light shed on it . this is a good beggining . a fun and interesting history that is well written and informative that explains the nature and philosophy of libertarianism and the people behind it . seth j. frantzma
