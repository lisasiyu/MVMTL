the first of a great series at first blush , the everard family does n't look like much on which to base a series of heroic sailors . hugh , drummed out of the service before the war in some unnamed scandal but pulled back in because of the emergency , is in love with his brother john 's wife . john , a general in the army in france , does not make an appearance , but his sons nick and david do . nick is feckless and irresponsible , just one step ahead of being drummed out of the royal navy himself , while david is more professional if somewhat dull . that in the course of the book , one 's opinion of everyone changes 180 degrees is a tribute to the author 's skill at both showing character development and also at revealing a character 's past layer by layer , like peeling an onion . the criticism commonly made about this book merely shows the inability of some critics to appreciate the intent of the book they are reviewing . yes , the book is choppy and yes , it is hard to follow the course of the action . one 's initial impulse is to wish for maps and an appendix , but then you realize that this is the whole point . fullerton 's goal is to present to the reader exactly how fighting the battle of jutland felt to those who were there . jutland was a confusing battle and it was many days before those who were there had the foggiest notion of the sequence of events . fullerton has studied the battle carefully and everything that happened in real life happens here at exactly the same time . but you ca n't construct a coherent whole out of the narrative , just as even lord jellicoe was n't able to do so . for that , you need to consult another book ( i would recommend rules of the game by andrew gordon , which is not only the finest description of the battle , but one of the finest works of military history ) , but do it after you read this book , so that you get the full flavor of the writer 's intent . very few writers capture the fog of war as well as fullerton does
