lots of interesting examples this book is filled with lots of interesting examples detailing life and attitudes in the fifties when the book was written . it is a book about how psychological research , motivational research was being employed at the time to sell americans all kinds of things they did not necessarily really want , or were n't necessarily very good for them . sounds very much like reality as we now know it . this selling also extended to politicians , and packard foresaw the way the image would become in many instances more important than the message in choice of political candidates . as i said the book is filled with information . i am embarassed to say that i have in all my years on this planet and at various dentists never learned packard 's great insight that it does not make much sense to focus one 's truth-brushing activities in the morning after the microbes have had eight hours to work on one 's teeth . brush after you eat , he advises , as i now recall many dentists have told me through the years . in any case this is an enjoyable read by someone who understands that advertising is not simply manipulative and exploitative but also adds color and interest to the culture .
