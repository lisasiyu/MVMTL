a welcome return when michael nyman first published this work in the 70s , it was the only book of its kind to discuss some of the most cutting-edge stuff going around . most musical texts avoided discussing the fluxus group as & quot ; music , & quot ; but nyman integrates these radicals easily , and provided the first discussion of the scratch orchestra ( cardew et al ) , and related topics . the book still contains some of the clearest discussions of these topics around . it 's great to have it back in print , though too bad nyman could n't be bothered to provide updates on some of the folks discussed , like hugh skempton
