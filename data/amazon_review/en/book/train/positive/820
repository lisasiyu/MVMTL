the civil war mr foote has written about the `` war between the states '' . he tells the story of the war . it is not the story of slavery or its demise , not about the country 's explosive economic growth that ensued , not about a lot of other subjects , just about the war and the men who led it and fought it . if you want to experience the ghastlyness that millions of americans did in 1862 to 1865 , read these books . no one has done this better .
