if you would like to see how a psychic lives her life and how her abilities affect her , then this diary will interest you . ms. choquette comes across as a charming , friendly person whom one would love to have over for dinner . she writes about her parents ( especially her mother ) and how her large family was close and sort of quirky . she describes her early psychic experiences and her training with two teachers who open her abilities up even more and teach her about life . the most enjoyable part of the book for me was the descriptions sonia gave of clients , mostly from the 70s -- lime green hot pants , bouffant hairdos , tie-dyed t-shirts and platform shoes ... those were the days ... how did anyone get a date back then ? the only criticism i have about the book is that ms. choquette mentions several times that her family was catholic and religiously so . i do not doubt her family 's religious sensbilities , but the church teaches against almost everything that sonia practices and believes -- reincarnation , clairvoyance , ascended masters , divination with tarot cards , spirit guides , etc . i do n't think it is possible to be a catholic in the sense of someone who believes in the dogmas of the church and be a new ager as sonia is . she also says that she prayed the rosary before her readings and one of her teachers said that she would attract only good spirits that way , but she also needed to pray the our father . the rosary requires the recitation of the our father at least 6 times , so i was confused when sonia said she then began to pray the our father as well . i wonder what rosary she was praying .
