big hit ! my son who is 6 yrs old received this for christmas . he is able to read quite well on his own but he really enjoys listening to the stories . sometimes he will read along with the book and this helps with word recognition and other times he 'll listen to the cd at bedtime . we plan on using them on a future car trip which will be something great to help pass the time
