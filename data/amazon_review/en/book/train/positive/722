all encompassing as a texan who first moved to europe at age 13 in 1961 , pell 's book was like reading the story of my life . and yet it made me understand so many things that were always something of a conundrum ( such as why the french looked down on everything american in general but adored the kennedy 's ) to the sinister goings-on of the mccarthy era ( they actually burned books considered subversive in american embassies abroad , such as `` works by notorious radicals like mark twain and theodore dreiser '' ) . i got this book because i wanted to have a better understanding of why the u.s. is where it is today , and it more than filled the bill , in an all-emcompassing way . thank you , mr. pells
