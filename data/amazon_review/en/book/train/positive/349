great articles on defining and teaching about leadership the wide variety of articles on leadership covers well items from the basic topics such as the difference between managers and leaders to how someone can be both ( and the tensions that can cause ! ) . two of the best articles were on how leaders really spend their time during the day and how leaders foster an environment in which other people can also be identified and brought forward as leaders . i would 've rated this five stars , but there are a couple of articles ( on 'defining moments ' and ceos ) that were n't a complete waste of time but seemed too far divorced from the typical leader within a company that i was surprised the hbr did n't find something more likely to be widely applicable to fill the space
