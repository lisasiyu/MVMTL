a common ground for all i 've been going to grouphug.us for years now , it 's the best place to go when you need a little pick me up . i have learned that people are truely psycho . that fact alone makes me feel 10x better about the things i 've done . when i found out that there was a book published , i had to go buy it right away . i am so glad that i did . this is one of the funniest things i have ever read . i have passed it around to many of my friends , they all agree that it is awesome . it was the best christmas present i have ever found . no matter what people are interested in , they all adore this book . i have three copies of this ; one in my bedroom , one on my coffee table , and one in my bathroom . i suggest you buy this book if you want a good laugh or if you want to learn about the bizarre behavior of you neighbors
