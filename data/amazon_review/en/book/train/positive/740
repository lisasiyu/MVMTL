witty writing , fascinating story ... maybe a little whiney sean wilsey is certainly a skilled writer . i found his writing style insightful , lively , and very funny . the story of his childhood is jaw-dropping and if it were n't for his wit , this could be a very uncomfortable story to read . i enjoyed the suspense wilsey builds into his story , which can be missing from memoirs . he leads you along with his child 's perspective to keep you turning pages and feel the same jolt he must have felt as a child living through this story . my only real issue with this book was a nagging question in my mind on how much of it was the author working through his childhood pain and how much was revenge or whining . assuming the events described in the book are truthfully presented , i still had a difficult time accepting his parents as complete villains . as he comes to a mild sort of acceptance of his parents ' in the end , i felt i was left out of the journey . still , it is a compelling story with lively writing and well worth reading
