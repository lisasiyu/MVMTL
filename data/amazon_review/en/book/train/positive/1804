loved it i was n't sure at first if i would like this story . but i found that i could not put it down . it is a love story , but its so much more the devinci code of vampires you might even say . i like how the authors explain the reason for vampires and how darkness and light need each other to survive . this story takes its time , but its not boring . i loved all the characters , and didnt miss the sex scenes or gore . it wasnt needed and it would have taken away from the story . i want to thank the authors for this great story , great writing..
