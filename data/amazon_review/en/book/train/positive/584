pure fun ! `` valley of the dolls '' is pure fun . it 's got great characters -- from the small town girl trying to make it in the big city to the actress who needs to feel real to the singer who wants it all . reading this , i was reminded of today 's soap operas and also other novels of this genre . it was , for me , a fun read , though sometimes a little dark . it 's an older book but i think it 's withstood the test of time . i definitely recommned it , along with `` take your shirt off '' or anything by jackie collins .
