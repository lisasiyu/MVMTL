a refreshing look at british naval history bravo for mr. herman ! his perspective on the affect of the british raj and , in particular , the navy on the development of the western world is excellent and educational . the phenomenon of a relatively small nation exerting its influence around the globe by extending its power through a superbly constructed and manned navy is , as yet , unmatched . for fully two centuries , until world war ii finally exhausted the potential , the british policy of open sea lanes and its enforcement thereof permitted the development of the new world through trade with the old . this includes the united states , whose loss as a colony severely dented the empire , but eventiually created the power which has succeeded britain as world guarantor . mr. herman is good on detail , but the real strength of the book is his explanation of how naval development and use affected the world as a whole . he is candid about the problems , both physical and political , and respectful of those individuals who , even in bad times , retained the foresight to keep the navy , and , thus , the empire , on an even keel . an excellent read for anyone interested in western history
