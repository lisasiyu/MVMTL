*those mesmerizing eyes & a special easter egg* how could i have missed hunwick until now ? he is a rabbit-eared bandicoot , one of an endangered species , familiarly known in australia as the bilby . *aussie* reviewer `` lin '' won me over by suggesting that `` hunwick 's egg '' would be a great easter gift . hunwick and his mysterious egg become very special friends but the egg does not hatch . they are scrutinized by a collection of the weirdest animals you ever yearned to hug : a cockatoo , an echidna ( resembling a porcupine ) , and the hairiest of emus who could benefit from a bit of *bryll cream* . . . hunwick is all heart and reaches out to readers with the most irresistible eyes to ever appear on your radar screen ! but still the egg does not hatch . the plant life is gorgeous , drawn ever so delicately in watercolor pencils . i am most captivated by a plant resembling the eucalyptus , and other green wildflowers . after referring to my dictionary i felt tricked into falling for a rat , of all things . i do n't want to believe what my faithful reference says about this darling creature ! the more important reality is that happiness can erupt from the most unexpected of relationships . it is remarkable how loneliness vanishes when you can share your burrow . reviewer mchaiku recommends that you make sure you have an easter basket large enough to accommodate this precious book
