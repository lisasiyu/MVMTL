english education majors and secondary english teachers : check this out ! this text helped me to articulate the 'principles ' of standard english by examining our language in all its varieties scientifically and intuitively . such articulation necessates a thorough understanding of the notions of descriptive vs. prescriptive , standard vs. nonstandard , formal vs. informal , grammatical vs. ungrammatical , and constitutive vs. regulative . this introductory text is written for the mature student who has had little or no background in linguistics or traditional school grammar . consequently , the authors begin by demonstrating how traditional grammar instruction with its eight parts of speech and semantic definitions falls terribly short of accounting for the many rule exceptions and illogicalities of langauge . i highly recommend this text for english education majors and secondary school english teachers .
