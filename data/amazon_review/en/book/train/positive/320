stop searching . begin here i am one of those freaks who would look at a bezillion books before settling with one . ( talking about computer books ofcourse ! ) . this is especially significant when it comes to xml because there is so much tech jargon out there & it is really hard find a book that does not get lost in the details & instead introduce us to the core right away . this book does exactly that . you will start writing decent xml right away . the following will be helpful . 1 . html knowledge ( a little ) 2 . the concept of scripts 3 . the concept of css 4 . the concept of xml when i say 'the concept of ' , i am only talking about a surface level , `` purpose of existence '' kind . even if you do n't know anything about xml , you will be fine with this book . the book gradually introduces the concepts & does a very neat job of explaining new ideas . peace .
