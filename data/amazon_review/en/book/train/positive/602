`` you will be haunted by this story ... '' i 've just finished page 341 , the last page . it 's midnight here in these connemara hills and i ca n't rest . i 'm unsettled . i need to write something about this book . but what ? do i love it ? do i hate it ? in the beginning i felt like quitting after every ten pages , then continuing after the next ten pages , and so on , and so on . i felt myself both repulsed and seduced . eventually i gave in . gave in to nick flynn 's words , sentences , story , language , world , universe . the universe of nick flynn 's disfunctional family : his alcoholic , delusional , absentee father and his suicidal mother , form the foundation of this memoir . in large measure it 's a journey in search of his father , a man who lives by his wits , fuelled by alcohol , driven by the delusion/fear of writing the 'great american novel ' ( with a million dollar advance and the nobel prize certainties in that delusion ) , to eventual homelessness on the street . it 's also nick flynn is search of himself . but it 's none of the above . it 's truly a work of literature that sets out , on every page , to capture , and lose , the mystery of the human condition . it 's surreal , a glimpse at a parallel universe that we may all be living . this book finds a kinship with joyce and beckett , and it 's no wonder that nick flynn chooses an excerpt from beckett 's 'endgame ' to open the story : hamm : scoundrel ! why did you engender me ? nagg : i do n't know . hamm : what ? why did n't you know ? nagg : that it 'd be you . you will be haunted by this story long after you 've finished reading it .
