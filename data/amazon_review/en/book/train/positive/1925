delightful ! karen o'connor 's new book is a gem . i found myself laughing out loud , nodding and then relaying her quips and common sense with friends and family . i 've always enjoyed ms. o'connor 's other books , but this is the best yet . it 's also a book to share . buy one for yourself and give 'em as presents & quot ; just because. & quot ; that 's what i 'm going to do
