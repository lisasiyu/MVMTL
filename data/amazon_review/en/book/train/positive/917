a great read for parent and child ! my son is 8 and although he is a great reader ( has read all of the harry potter series more than once ) , he wanted me to read this one to him . i have to say we both enjoyed it equally . i would agree to a chapter or two every other night or so , but found myself agreeing to `` just one more chapter '' on a regular basis . it was nice to find something we both liked and looked forward to . what an imaginative tale . now i need to get the rest of the series..
