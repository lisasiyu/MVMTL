a 'coming of age beautifully ' account i received this book at my 60th birthday party ( which was a weekend with women only -30 of us - at a cottage in the canadian mountains ) . everyone autographed it and wrote something to me in it just like in the 50 's with your highschool yearbooks . each woman picked out a page and just wrote what she felt or thought . i also shared it with my friends who could n't come to the party and they also signed it happily and sincerely . there are many autographs and lines written throughout the book and i still look through the pages with enjoyment . women of all walks of life , all circumstances , all levels of inner and outer beauty featured within its pages - just like my friends . since then , i have bought it for most of my girlfriends at their coming of age parties . it 's a good time to be 60 , i will tell you that
