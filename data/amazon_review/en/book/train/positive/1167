forget the *game* part if you wanted to write a game for a pocketpc device this would absolutly be your book . however , i 've been writing utility applications i find myself using this book over other references . this is the best lightweight wince/pocketpc progamming book out there- games or not . harbour covers topics in a very easy-to-understand way- from graphics and sound to networking . no matter what the issue i usually go to this book first , then then web , then one of the other wince books i own if need be . if you 're new to wince ( esp . coming from a non win32 background ) this book is exceptionally great
