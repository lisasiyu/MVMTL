past meets present in another anne perry gem long spoon lane : a charlotte and thomas pitt novel , by anne perry was another excellent mystery set in perry 's evocative victorian setting . the mystery in this novel was not of the `` knock your socks off who would have ever thought it '' type . it was , rather , a very evenly paced novel in which many of the developments involved terrorism and the government 's response to the terrorists ' acts . it was very interesting to read about a piece of legislation that some of the characters supported . the legislation involved giving the police easier rules and access to search people and their homes . the obvious allusion to america 's patriot act and the debate it has spawned is an excellent piece of the overall picture . this book focused on thomas primarily , and his relationship with one of his true enemies . his professor moriarty if you will . i recommend this book and give it a solid and well deserved 4 out of 5 stars .
