i loved this as a kid someone wrote that this book is too depressing . i beg to differ . i 'm not a professional child psychologist , but looking back on my own experience , and how much i loved this book as a child , i think children have very powerful feelings all the time , including longing and sadness . it 's comforting to see those feelings described and reflected outside yourself . if adults act like the whole world is happy-happy all the time , it can feel very lonely and isolating when you have other feelings . i would venture to guess that empathizing with characters in stories helps children develop a sense of connection between their own feelings and other people 's feelings . this connection makes us feel less lonely and also allows us to be genuinely caring toward others . i can still see , in my mind 's eye , the picture of sylvester the rock under a blanket of snow , and feel the almost unbearable empathy that i felt for him when i read this book as a child . but it was a good feeling to feel such profound emotions . it was not unpleasant -- it was very real , alive , and human -- it made me feel connected with the world . and it was a safe place to feel these emotions , because i knew how the story ended , i knew everything would be okay . i loved this book very much . i wonder if i still have it ...
