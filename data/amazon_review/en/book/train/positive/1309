the distinct , distinguished catholic voice from the south i have n't read anything by flannery o'connor since `` all things that rise must converge . '' i fell in love with her stories . there is so much life in them . i read this work to get an idea about her `` sitz im leben '' , her life-situation , her milieu . a lot of it is correspondence , and there are some presentations as well . i am wondering if it speaks to the modern would-be novelist as much as it spoke to writers of her time and place . she says that one needs to write out of the context of where you are : the place , the people , the geography . this is mandatory , not optional . this book is for writers . i appreciate her writing about how to be catholic in the south , a very small minority . she has contributed much to finding faith in the stories of life , even violent and brutal stories . i look forward to my next work of hers
