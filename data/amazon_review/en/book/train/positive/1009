excellent short review that is true to its title this is an excellent short review of european quest for a language to unite its disparate nations with each other and the rest of the world . i thought that the book did an excellent job of staying on the subject and illustrating the progression of thought in this area . it does confine itself to europe and time period as defined in the beginning of the book . that is excellent , there is simply no other way to cover as much ground as the book attempts to do , and i feel that it does suceed admirably . as usual , eco 's erudition and research are amazing . this book is published in the context of a european series of books about europe and i wish there was a similar book series that would cover this ground for far east and india as well . i am sure people there worked on the same kind of problems . some of the problems with languages and methods described seem so obvious that one has to wonder what the authors themselves thought about them . of course , this is a whole other book series . i wish there was a 4 1/2 rating as i do not think this is truly a masterpiece , but certainly a very very good book from a very very good author of fiction and non-fiction . a bonus for fans of focault 's pendulum -- a lot of data in that fiction book refers to work discussed in this non-fiction work . great fun
