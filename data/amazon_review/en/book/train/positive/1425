excellent factual overview of the religion of ancient israel this is one book on ancient israel that actually delivers what its title promises . in & quot ; the early history of god & quot ; mark smith systematically sifts through archaelogical and literary data from bronze and iron age palestine , the mediterranean , and mesopotamia to find the earliest evidence for yhwh , his cult , and his context . chapters include discussions of yhwh and el , yhwh and baal , asherah and asherahs , cultic practices , such as communication with the dead and child sacrifice , at the sites where yhwh was worshiped , as well as a brief discussion of the beginnings of monotheism during the late monarchy . refreshingly for me , smith frames his argument on available evidence , not on wishful thinking , and the result is provocative and stimulating . the long introduction to this new edition covers the debate that has gone on since the book was originally published over ten years ago , and the extensive footnotes are a wealth of information on every side of the discussion . this is the kind of book that helps keep scholarship in good repute . do n't wait to read it
