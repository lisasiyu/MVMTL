an excellent overview this work grabs you immediately with its description of the `` standstill '' procedure . a patient is placed into a coma , the blood and body chilled and then the heart actually stopped while the surgeon skillfully digs around in the grey matter . fascinating stuff . the author is a journalist obviously awed by dr. spetzler and all that he ( and others ) have accomplished at the barrow institute in phoenix -- the book is primarily a story of dr. spetzler 's career and secondarily the developing science of neurosurgery . the reader is treated to descriptions of the daily life of residents -- rounds , m & m conferences , surgical procedures , etc . there are the obligatory descriptions of the hideously expensive gadgetry and imaging technology that has made modern neurosurgery possible . but something was missing . in attempting to simultaneously cover the entire field of neurosurgery ( as well as a curious diversion into the history of phoenix ) this book lost some of its punch . this could easily have been an incredibly interesting biography of dr. spetzler ( and if anyone writes one -- i 'm buying it ) , or a surgical techno-thriller about standstill procedures curing otherwise hopeless cases . better yet , a treatise on the cost/benefit tradeoffs presented by modern medicine with its increasing dependence upon pricey machines . not to mention the peculiar danger of saving a patient from a horrible aneurysm only to find that his or her personality is irrevocably changed -- and not for the better . unfortunately , the work was somewhat diluted by its lack of focus . nevertheless , highly recommended
