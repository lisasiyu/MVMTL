speaking of whining ... to : rat after spending my entire adult life as a working single mother , i find your whining about mothers as `` the most priveleged class '' uninformed , if not downright ludicrous . you feel you have to do all of their work for them while they lazily sit around the house ? i have never personally spent `` years on leave '' . although , i have covered countless shifts for my hungover or broken-hearted , childless co-workers , and have only stayed home with a sick child about 5 times in 13 years . i have taken on more [ ... ] , covered more [ ... ] and put up with more bull than i deserved , because as the sole support of my child , i could n't risk losing my job . i have been an employer 's bargain ! furthermore , rat -- you clearly do not understand the concept of flex time . flex time does n't mean somebody works less hours than you . flex time means there is an inherent flexibility built into everyone 's work schedule , so that work gets done , but life can happen to . you are probably familiar with this concept in reality -- have you ever skipped lunch so you could leave early to go to the dentist ? in the future , please try to wrap your brain around the bigger picture before you jump to such conclusions
