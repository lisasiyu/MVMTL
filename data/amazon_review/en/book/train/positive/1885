a great dual biography - one of the best ! yes , i realize that nesta webster believed in conspiracy theories but that does not take away from the balanced perspective of this excellent biography , one of the few dual biographies of louis xvi and marie antoinette . i believe that the royal couple needs to be studied as a unit in order to be understood . too many other biographies focus on one , at the other 's expense . the emphasis of this book , on the years before the revolution , includes many details omitted by other works . it is refreshingly free of the freudian bias infused by zweig and so many others into the life of the king and queen . i wish this excellent book were more widely known ; it is one of the best
