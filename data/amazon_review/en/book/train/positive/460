got me my mos master ! 1 play and learn all the functions of the 2003 applications . 2 use measureup practice tests ; you can play with all the functions in 2003 using the online version of the measureup practice test if you do n't have a copy of the all the 2003 applications . 3 use the certiport practice tests , the 2002 versions are just as helpful and seem to be free , so much overlaps . 4 use this book ; i never much used the printed copy , i used the adobe pdf version that came along with it along with the practice files
