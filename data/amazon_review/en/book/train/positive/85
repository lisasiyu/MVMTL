massive and masterful ! with over 1000 recipes , this cookbook is going to take some time to truly put through it 's paces , but i 've had great results with the few dishes i 've tried so far . the turkey wraps with chipotle mayo rocked , with a gem of a condiment included - pickled red onion . i 'd use that on any sandwich , anytime . the sauces for halibut with spicy asian vinaigrette ( really a sambal vinaigrette ) and wasabi cream were awesome . veggie dishes like asparagus with shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners . granted , i have n't even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook - but so far so good ! i picked this up a few months agao as a remainder and paid about 10.00 for it - about a penny a recipe ! what a deal
