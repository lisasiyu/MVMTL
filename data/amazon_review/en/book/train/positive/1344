it 's how we remember i , like most of my women friends i 've talked to , including my mother and my sisters , shape memories and moments based on the clothes we were wearing at the time . i bought this book in 1995 when it was first published and have referred to it several times over the years for inspiration and support . i found it in the `` self-help '' section of the bookstore . this little book does as good a job as anything i 've read , at getting in a woman 's head . clothes are how we remember . wearing our favorite clothes or shoes or carrying our favorite handbag gives us confidence and helps us cope . for a while , i kept a diary of drawings of outfits whenever i 'd want to remember an important event . ask me what i was wearing when i held my niece for the first time ( navy blue a-line liz claiborne dress ) or when i went to my first job interview out of college ( a polka-dot suit i called the stewardess ) or the night i was first kissed by the love of my life ( a shirt that said `` keep on truckin '' in glitter ... heh ) . a good friend 's mother passed away a few months ago , and i bought a copy for her , since ms. beckerman mentions the death of her own mother . she also mentions marriages , divorces , babies , and career successes , and most importantly , what she wore . it makes a great gift for any woman . or for yourself
