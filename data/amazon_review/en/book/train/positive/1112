reading other 's email is fun ! i loved this book ! it was written in email form and frankly i love reading email and being sneaky and reading other 's email is quite fun as well so reading this book was a little guilty pleasure ! it is about a woman who finds neighbor passed out and then her 'nephew ' comes to take care of her pets while the neighbor is in coma in hospital . turns out the nephew isnt really the nephew but a friend the nephew made help him out because he didnt want to help his aunt . the woman has emails from her friends in there , coworkers as well . it is really a fun quick read .
