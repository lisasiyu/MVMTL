amazing book i acutally read the entire book unlike almost all of the people who gave this book a bad rating . ann coulter is a conservative genius . she pokes holes in the liberal agenda like no one else . she is intelligent , and makes very good arguements . the only reason this book got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last chapter was a bit dull . this is some of her earlier writing , and therefore was not the best . she should have put this chapter closer to the beginning , so it would n't be the last thing the reader remembers . other than the last chapter , this book is filled with great humor , while still being informative and making her arguements . she includes some publisher notes from her articles to show that the media does have a liberal bias ( even though they say they do n't ) ... this book should be on everyone 's must read list ! !
