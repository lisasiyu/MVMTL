a good book for those who are gifted or their parents being gifted does n't mean you know everything and have figured everything out . it just means you 're brighter than the average bear and can leap to conclusions and see connections faster than others . you also remember better and thus can not stand things being repeated over and over . unfortunately , because society is designed for those who are less bright , this causes problems for the gifted . this book explores what those problems are . both while growing up and as adults . a very enlightening book and one i recommend to those who are gifted or who are parents of gifted children/adults
