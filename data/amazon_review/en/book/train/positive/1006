fascinating as a geography and history buff , i was fascinated by marco polo 's journal of his travels . i followed his routes on my atlas and discovered that he did not always follow a west to east route , but rather zigzagged north to south to east as his interests changed . in india he narrates his fascination with the role of monkeys in society , the strange vestments and customs of the people there , so alien to anything he had ever seen or experienced . then he spends years and years in the orient , befriending the chinese emperor , learns to speak chinese to the point where he practically forgets his native italian , even becomes governor of a chinese state . from adolescence intoto adulthood , marco travels with his father and uncle during 30 years , discovering the marvels of a world unknown to the west , by ship , elephant or camel , or on foot over some of the world 's highest mountains , against all odds but driven forth by endless curiousity and optimism .
