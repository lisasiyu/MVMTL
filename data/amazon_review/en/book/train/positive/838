well researched and tolerably convincing this is a very well researched book . the author has taken great pains to measure and analyze vermeer 's paintings , finding a striking feature that many of them , when back-projected through the perspective view point at the size of the painting , imply a consistent location of a back wall to the common room used in the pictures . the author asserts that the only reasonable explanation for this coincidence is that vermeer used a camera obscura for at least some of the layout of his paintings . this comes off as very plausible , though the analysis is limited to paintings that include a tiled floor . it would have been interesting to see this work extended through photogrammetry of objects of known sizes in the paintings ( chairs , musical instruments , etc ) and applied to more of the paintings . i think the only real failing in the argument is that vermeer could have could have had the skill to paint perspective of this quality , and therefore not needed the aid of a camera . as pointed out in the text , he was not bound to perfect accuracy ; there are some deviations
