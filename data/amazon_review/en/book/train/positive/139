totally suprising ( in a good way ) this book was totally awesome ! i mean people think that a sequel would just completly suck but no ! it was great . i was very suprised how the author pulled me in with all the quirky romance , again ! i can not express how great this book is . buy it ! read it ! anybody who loved the first one will abosolutly without a doubt love the second one
