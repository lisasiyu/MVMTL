truly amazing while at the moma i happened across the chuck close exhibit . i had heard of him , but had never seen his work . as i walked through the exhibit i thought to myself , & quot ; big deal , a bunch of 9 foot tall photographs. & quot ; but when i notice the medium was acrylic i was astonded ! this book captures the unbelievable talent of this amazing artist . it shows his the vast array of materials he used from paint , to pieces of paper . i would highly recommend buying this book ! it is one of my favorites
