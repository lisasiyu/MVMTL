the only book you will need ! i became a first time homeowner 2 years ago and i did n't know anything about gardening . my friend recommended this book to me and it has been very educational . it is the only book i reference when planning my garden . this book is broken down by topic : perennials , annuals , trees , shrubs , etc . it explains the differences between all the flowers and what environment is best for each flower/shrub/vine/trees . the pictures are great ! there are pictures of almost every plant he describes . i have able to choose my flowers to plant each season from the book so when i go to the nursery i know exactly what i need
