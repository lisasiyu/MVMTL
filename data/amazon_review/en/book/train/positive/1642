great vocabulary builder ! my 4 yr old is special needs and we use this book as one of our activities . the book covers counting , colors , and so much more . things are color coded and stickers are seperated according to the section of the book they apply to . it allows for success even in children who would have a harder time . my son even tries to match the angle of the sticker with the colored shadow he is placing it on . it allows for a lot of practice with pragmatic speech . i can ask questions very easily , and he tries to answer based on what is in front of him . he gets very excited when he has finished a whole page . he attends very well with this book . i recommend it to everyone
