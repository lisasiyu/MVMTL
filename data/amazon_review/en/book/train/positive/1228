one-eyed cat one-eyed cat written by paula fox is a sweet book about a boy whose mom is in wheelchair and dad is minister at the church . ned the boy receives a share of trouble throughout the book . i enjoyed this book because it is interesting within the book about rivers , and animals . i disliked the book because it started out so slow in the beginning and rest of the book . i also disliked the book because the characters are dull and there is n't much rising action and major conflict so it is not as exciting as other books . i also liked it because of it 's setting of different places by the hudson river . this is a good book , i suggest reading it . good reading for all ages . dylan p. creston , california
