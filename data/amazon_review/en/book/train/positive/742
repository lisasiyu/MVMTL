sisters in crime the best thing about case histories is that it is not a murder mystery . kate atkinson 's novel has many of the characteristics of a traditional murder mystery - sympathetic gumshoe , unsolved crimes , supernumerary suspects , and cats - but the story is more a study of the confusion inherent in the innocent interactions of sisters and daughters . i was pleased by the lifelike , sympathetic presentation of the two male characters . unfortunately the many female characters never lifted off the page . the plot of case histories consists of three unrelated cold cases . all the dramatic tension of the book consists of the promise that these cases will be connected by their resolution . but this resolution fails to materialize . the detective solves one murder , the perpetrator casually confesses to a second , and the third is disclosed only in an anonymous flashback . and the cats live happily ever after
