as a certified fixed star astrologer , this book is foundation material i am one of a few fixed star astrologers in the world and no matter how much i read , study or research in this fascinating area , i will always come back to ebertin 's work . though often his conclusions appear negative , if you will take them into the light of present life , you will understand how to derive the highest value for each star . for example when considering algol , the star connected to beheadings , one can examine the aspects to this star and discover the person may have a tendency to lose their head in the aligned matters astrologically described . a star of extreme passion , algol will also reflect the exact statements indicated by ebertin - take princess diana 's death or nicole simpson - both active under algol at the time of their deaths . i do not believe you can consider yourself knowledgable in fixed stars without this book . it is definitely one of the basic texts on the subject , others include the work of robison , guttman and of course recently bernadette brady .
