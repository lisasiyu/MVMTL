another fine book by the master poirot is given a case by his old pal spence which takes him to a small village , where the fussy detective must unravel clues behind a crime in which the main suspect has already been arrested and sentenced ... hercule 's indignities at the run down boarding house he 's staying at make up the bulk of the story 's humor , but the mystery is great fun , too and i doubt anyone can guess the killer , unless you 're paying amazingly close attention . the characters here are some of agatha 's most entertaining , and mrs oliver , with her uncanny intuition , always makes a nice flighty side kick..
