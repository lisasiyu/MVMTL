best rabbit book ever ! i have read at least 6 books on raising rabbits and this one is the best by far ! ( bennett 's other rabbit books are also great - but there is a lot of overlap so only one is needed . ) i used his information every step of the way when building my rabbitry , including building my own all-wire hutches . if you are interested in raising rabbits , be sure to join the arba ( american rabbit breeder 's association at http : //arba.net/ ) it is very inexpensive to join and membership includes a free copy of the `` official guide book raising better rabbits & cavies '' 256 pages and another great book . the book itself is worth the membership , but you also get a subscription to the magazine `` domestic rabbits .
