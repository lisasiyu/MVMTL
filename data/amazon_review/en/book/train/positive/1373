starting to live again i was recently diagnosed as having hepatitis c. the immediate effect was shock and disbelief . i was under the mistaken impression that the way a person contracted hep c was by iv drug abuse or a tainted blood transfusion . this threw me for a loop since the only blood i had ever recieved was in 1950 and 1959 and i had never abused any drugs , i had no idea this virus existed back when i had recieved blood . i was afraid to tell my family what i had and therefore had no support . after reading this book not only did i have more information with which to approach my family but an idea of what to expect in my life from here on out . it is seldom one finds an information type book that is written in a way that makes it an easy read but this one falls in that category . even those in the mid adolescent years would have no problem reading and understanding the information . i have already purchased a copy of this book to give my daughter when i tell her that i have this disease
