rush and me i used to be a good friend to rush . i listened to his program all the time . when i first saw this book , i ignored it . finally , after it had been in the window of our bookstore for several months , i picked it up and looked inside . i was amazed ! however , i had to put it down because i thought it was too negative . it called rush names . i did not need to have that . finally , i tried getting it at the library , but they said they did not have a copy , because they said it was `` too controversial . '' so when the price came down , i bought a used copy for a couple of bucks , and read the whole thing . i was amazed some more ! rush used to have 20 million listeners to his talk show . he was a legendary , rich talk show host . this book tells you exactly how rush became a rich , popular talk show host . and he is thinner now that he has recovered from his unfortunate drug problem . and you know , that sort of thing could happen to anybody . but i had trusted rush , and his values , and i kind of felt he let me down . so for me , the title is not appropriate . rush limbaugh is a big , rich talk show host who cuts corners on his values would be a better title . rush is no idiot , either . now , by some `` coincidence '' al franken is a talk show host too . and , i bet he learned how by studying how rush did it ! if franken can do it , you can do it ! do n't miss out on this great opportunity ! get a copy . look how cheap it is now . tell your friends
