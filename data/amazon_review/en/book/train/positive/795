not as frenetic as dirk pitt , but a nice diversion ... kurt austin is back in the latest installment by clive cussler and paul kemprecos ... polar shift . it 's a nice `` mind candy '' bit of diversion ... austin and the numa crew are once again pulled into breaking up a plot that threatens to destroy the earth . a group of anarchists ( well-funded ones ) have discovered a way to force a polar shift of the magnetic north and south pole . by doing so , they hope to destroy the world 's navigation and communication infrastructure , allowing their heavily shielded replacements to survive as the only game in town . the only thing that can stop them is a young woman who is the granddaughter of the original scientist who learned about the shift decades . she does n't know that she holds the key to reversing the polarity , but numa and austin have to find her before the others get there first ... i did n't expect blockbuster material here , just a fun read . and basically that 's what i got . the austin series is n't quite as frenetic a pace as the dirk pitt series , nor is the dialog between austin and his sidekick quite as entertaining . still , it was a book i enjoyed picking up each evening before i went to bed . i 'm not sure i would have wanted to pay $ 27 for it , but as a library book it was fine
