excellent book for anyone in business or professional field this book was part of my professional ethics class . i have to say i was very skeptical ( as the textbooks are never fun and one guy gave it a poor review ) at first . however , after reading the book i have learned a lot . ethics is not a matter of conservative or liberal ( if that 's true than god himself has to be a liberal not to mention bible talked about ethical behavior too ) . this book focused on why we need ethics in business and how proper ethics enforcement can save a business from corruption and other questionable behavior which eventually may bring down a business ( think enron ) . it talked about both sides and did n't force someone 's opinion on us rather helped us make our own decision which will be ethical and benefiting to the business . although it was my text book i 'd recommend this book to anyone as part of business strategy making .
