nice picture book basically diamond baratta design is a lovely picture book - if you are a decorator or decorating your own home it can be a good source of inspiration or at least a few ideas .if just a fan of decorators it might disappoint as there is little substantive background information about their careers and philosophy . a good mate to this volume would be a book about dorothy draper as the diamond baretta team follow through on many of her ideas about color and scale .
