gripping story i found this book at my local used book store . i was a little hesitant to buy it because i was afraid it would your typical teenage agnst story . but for only four dollars , what was there to lose ? i was in for a surprise and a real treat ! this book not only captures the teenage insecurities that most of us have felt , or are feeling , but it also captures that nervous , excited , almost panicked feeling a lot of us get after graduating high school , and moving on into the & quot ; real & quot ; world . the book was unique in many many ways . the first third of the book was the main character describing a history of her life by describing pictures she had found , and giving a short story for each one . the second section , told from her point of view , gave the reader insight into her high school life , dealing with peer pressure , school , and dating . in the third part of the book , she begins college , and also begins to spiral out of control , and the books tone shows this . this section is told in third person , as if she is going through so much , that she feels she is watching herself from the outside . i was very impressed with the writing style and the story line . i would recommend this book to anyone
