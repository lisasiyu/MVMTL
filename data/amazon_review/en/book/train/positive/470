leave reality at the door this is not a typical read for me , but i enjoyed it . i read the first 148 pages wondering if this was going to be a waste of time , but when i hit chapter 44 , i read the rest of the book in one sitting . loved max , frannie , kit & all the others . looking forward to reading `` the lake house ''
