one of my favorite carole matthews i found this to be one of the best carole matthews titles that i have read . carole 's books always present such interesting challenges faced by her protagonists when it comes to life and love , and this one is no exception . set in a small village on the outskirts of suburban england , carole does an excellent job in capturing what life is like in a small town , with neighbors watching your every move , speculating and spreading rumors that sometimes only have a sliver of truth to them . she even reveals how wrong people can be about what is innocent , and what is n't in a small town through hilarious antics of a housewife turned prostitute . the main character , rose , is trying very hard to start a new life in a small town , but nobody wants to give her a break because they do n't understand what she does as an aromatherapist , and mistakenly think she is a prostitute ! as she settles in , she begins to fall in love with a local , who is going through his own relationship troubles . however , she is still torn by the affair that sent her fleeing from london . i could n't stop reading as rose tries so desperately to make the right decision , faltering for some time but eventually coming to terms with her feelings after a rather muddy encounter ! a definite must for any fan of carole matthews , or british chic lit
