2nd in genealogy mystery series . fun read ! bloodline by fiona mountain is the second book in the natasha blake genealogist mystery series . after an elderly man hires natasha to investigate the family background of his granddaughter 's fiance , he is mysteriously murdered . the man 's son hires natasha to find out why . mountain does a much better job this time of connecting with the reader . natasha 's connections to her friends and family deepen and develop as well . there are loads of subplots , including natasha 's insomnia which occasionally makes her take actions that had me shaking my head in disbelief . the story takes an unexpected dark turn as natasha finds out that sometimes finding the answers to questions only creates more questions with answers no one wants to hear . this was a fun read that made me think a bit too . i look forward to the next in the series .
