absolutely incredible book for a believer i ca n't exactly say how a non-believer would take this book , there is that guy who wrote something about evilution producing this or that , but other than that i 'll have to read the other reviews . anyway the beauty of this book is in how well it illustrates the extreme extent to which god goes to in order to bring us to salvation , while still holding the very fabric of life amidst consciousness and all of it 's beauty and glory in careful suspension . i believe this is the notion of his love that lewis is focused on . as a last resort method of god communicating with us , pain plays a - well - painful role , to which i 'm no stranger . still i 'll bet that when we get to heaven god will truthfully say , it hurt me far , far more than it hurt you . amen .
