mrs. piggle-wiggle , mrs. grassfeather , mrs . ragbag ... where does it end ? this book is great . if you ever have a problem with your child 's behavior , mrs. piggle wiggle is the one to call . her outrageous solutions to common child behavior ailments seem to work well . in most cases she recommends letting the child wallow in his or her own awful behavior until rock bottom is reached . only then is the child aware of the real-life consequences for bad behavior . a perfect book for teaching personal responsibility . not to mention it 's filled with fun names like mrs. moohead , mrs. broomrack , and mrs. crankminor . my only complaint is mrs. piggle-wiggle herself is present for only a very small percentage of the book , and the book ends without even going back to her . i was thinking ( and hoping ) she 'd be on every page . this goes to show you , mrs. piggle-wiggle , who loves kids more than anybody , still lets them bring on their own suffering when it comes to correcting a major attitude problem . if a kid does n't want to eat ... shoot , let the kid starve . if the kid does n't want to pick up toys , then let the kid get trapped in clutter . show kids what it 's like to have to clean up their own mess instead of cleaning up their mess for them all the time . ( this does n't apply to diaper changes of course . ) in addition to the elaborate piggle-wiggle cures , the kids in the book get a spanking from their parents every now and then , especially after playing around with the laundry chute . sorry kids , ca n't do that
