a very good book but you will need others this is my 3rd book on real estate investing and i must say that each is totally different , with different ideas and different strategies . i think it 's important to keep this in mind because there is not one single book that can tell you everything you need to know . i like how she talks about goal setting , something i 've learned from tony robbins and that i feel is really important . i like how she calculates the rate of return . i like her differing point of views . i would have never considered an adjustable rate mortgage before reading this book . overall i learned a lot , despite having already read 2 other good books . a few things i did n't like : i would have liked more information on selecting and comparing properties . and especially calculating if i can afford it or not . the information she gives is quite good , but since this is the most important topic i think it deserved even more . the book is well worth the price and if you 're serious about investing i highly recommend it .
