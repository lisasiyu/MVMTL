it 's the wake up call i have read nearly all of mr. walsch 's books . the cwg series is the world 's wake up call . you must have an open mind to be able to see the true depth of this series . at one time , i used to believe as the naysayers . then i started to wake up and truely see the illusion , for what it really is . people find that the hardest thing to accept is that what we truely believe in may not have been presented through the generations correctly . people have a hard time accepting that any belief , great or small , may not be totally correct . the closed minded will never see this . the wise and opened mined person will . i highly admire mr. walsch for revealing to the world , what he transscribed from his conversations with god . i truely and deeply believe what he has written . i believe because i can now see , for when before i could not . his works are far from rubbish . most believe the bible in it 's present form must be accepted as is . i submit , where is the version of the bible before it was ordered to be edited by emperor constitine in 325 ? do you want the truth ? simply by learning to meditate on a daily basis , will allow everyone see that we are here to recreate ourselves anew in greatest version of the grandest vision of who we really are . only if you are truly honest with yourself and learn meditation , you will then believe in these treasured works . i recommend `` spiritual breakthrough '' by john van auken to learn meditation . it 's the how to guide to reach the consciousness of god
