a timeless work of art the story is sweet , set in an earlier time but does not come across dated . there is an opportunity for math lessons ( sal keeps eating her berries = subtraction ; tremendous mouthful = size/proportion ) here . beyond that , kids just love this story . i do n't know if it is that there is one main character , a child , and another prominent character , a bear , or what , but i have given this as a gift and it is always a favorite
