every bit as good as elegant universe i would respectfully disagree with those who suggest that `` fabric of the cosmos '' is just a rehash of `` elegant universe '' with little more to offer , and in fact not as well written . on the contrary , i found `` fabric of the cosmos '' to be equally as engaging as `` elegant universe '' and to offer a great deal of new material . it is true that some of the background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is covered in both books , but i for one preferred it that way . i read `` elegant universe '' several years ago , and although i have a general feel for the concepts , i appreciated the refresher on many of the details . by including the background material in `` fabric of the cosmos '' i never felt lost , and i never had to refer back to another book . the background material on relativity and quantum mechanics is similar in both books , but it is not identical , so i never felt like i was rereading the same old stuff . another minor issue i 've seen some complain about is the use of the simpson 's ( and other ) television characters in his examples . personally i could care less what characters are used in the examples , but from a practical standpoint , i much preferred names like marge and lisa to names like slim and jim ( which were used in `` elegant universe '' ) . i could easily keep track of what marge and lisa were doing in an example , whereas i was often confused about what slim and jim were doing . the similar sounding names drove me crazy . so from a practical standpoint , i preferred the names used in `` fabric of the cosmos '' . now what about the content of the two books ? for me `` elegant universe '' was more of an introduction to string theory , whereas `` fabric of the cosmos '' was much more an exposition on cosmology . in `` elegant universe '' roughly the first 130 pages gave a background on relativity and quantum mechanics , and then the remainder of the book , some 250 pages , was about string theory . in `` fabric of the cosmos '' roughly the same space is devoted to background info on relativity and quantum mechanics , ( about 120 pages ) but with more of a cosmological slant related to questions of `` what is space '' and `` what is time '' . then roughly the next 200 pages give an outstanding description of where we 're at in terms of cosmological theories about the origin of the universe . if you want an excellent description of inflation theory , higgs fields , and the like , this is the source . and then only in the last roughly 120 pages does greene bring string theory into all of this , and then with the same overarching cosmological slant which is a common thread running through the book . bottom line is `` fabric of the cosmos '' provided me with a terrific overview of cosmology that i did not get from `` elegant universe '' . both books are outstanding , and i would certainly recommend both . the point being simply that these are different books , and `` fabric of the cosmos '' is not just a rehash of `` elegant universe '' . finally , as in `` elegant universe '' , greene takes the reader very logically from one step to the next . i 've read many books that make broad statements about how one thing relates to another with zero explanation of how that relationship was derived . in greene 's book this is never an issue . sometimes this can make the writing a bit long and dense , but i would much prefer a book that i can logically work my way through , albeit sometimes with a bit of patience , than a book with logical gaps that no amount of patience is going to resolve . do n't get me wrong though , even though the book can sometimes be a bit dense , i never found it to be dry . greene does a great job of making the book engaging and enjoyable to read throughout . very highly recommended
