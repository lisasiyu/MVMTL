be prepared for an eye opener even a few years after it 's release , eric schlosser 's `` fast food nation '' still sends a strong message to the reader and exposes the fast food industry for what it really is ... a group of very large and very powerful marketing companies ... not a purveyor of good food -- or nutritious food for that matter . for many years , food additives and techniques have been the dirty little secret of the industry , but not these things are starting to surface . the book takes you through the processing warehouses and chemical plants that the industry uses to `` make '' the foods served at these restaurants . it opens your eyes to practices done to cut costs and sacrifice your health in the process . i 've recommended this book to many of my clients and many are reluctant to read it at all , probably because of the emotional attachment they have to their favorite fast food . since this book came out , there are so many more studies and reports on what is in the fast foods then there ever were before . reports including additives , trans-fats and other inflammation causing ingredients are helping the industry clean up it 's act . this does n't mean that fast food is good for you , it just means that schlosser has done an excellent job at bringing attention to an industry that was n't challenged as strongly as it should have been . i personally have n't had fast food for over 5 years , but -- even that far removed -- as i was reading this i felt sick to my stomach . read this book and you 'll never step foot in mcdonalds again . kevin gianni , ncsf-cpt author and personal traine
