this man is a visionary and a genius if only washington could embrace the ideas laid out in this book . i think newt would make a fresh and bright addition to the mccain administration . perhaps even vp . newt does have everything one needs to be the president , however not in 2008 . the conditions disallow the risk of running anything but a sure thing to stave off the potential nightmare that both hillary or al gore represent . but newt 's knowledge and wisdom will flow freely throughout the coming political process and his message will be heard . bravo
