outstanding simply put , this was an outstanding book . if you are a guy then vince flynn 's books are for you . lots of action with just a touch of romance . you become very attached to the characters , epsically rapp and rieley . in the mitch rapp series it is hard to put one book above any other and the third option stays true to all of that , very well written . i am by no means the fastest reader around and being a soldier myself mt time can be at a primeium but i finished this book in two days , impossible to put down
