beautiful one of the best novels i have ever read . this book has everything a good read should : characters that become real to the reader , a wonderful sense of place , a sense of history and knowledge . not only do you get completely wrapped up in the world of vine sullivan , but you also learn more about yourself in the process . a truly beautiful book that i ca n't recommend highly enough . i 've bought a copy for everyone i love
