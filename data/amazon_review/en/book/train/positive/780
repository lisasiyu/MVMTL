fascinating roller coaster to discovery andrew solomon is a science writer who has taken the risky step of telling the vast , intriguing story of a deeply personal condition in the first person - which means that we follow him on an extraordinary roller coaster ride toward self discovery and healing ( solomon suffers very serious depression and tries all manner of `` cures '' including a death-wish desire to contract aids , and bizarre tribal rites in africa ) while also tracing the long tortuous history ( and geography ) of depression as a subject . our understanding of depression , solomon lucidly reveals , has been the subject of a centuries-long tug of war between two mindsets : those who see it as a chemical condition , and those who see it as a psychological ( ie emotional ) condition . as the history of civilisation veers between rational and romantic eras , so too has the understanding and treatment of depression . is it any wonder that a modern sufferer is torn between the talk-therapies and the chemical therapies such as prozac ? andrew solomon comes down with an argument that both therapies are flipsides of the same whole - and that both have a role to play as sufferers seek escape from the bottomless black abyss . on the way he covers related subjects including depression and suicide and depression and creativity - and , this is the miracle of his writing and a tribute to his approach - the subject matter comes over as fascinating rather than gruelling . if you are a sufferer , or live with one - or simply wish to know better how the human mind really works , this volume is pretty compelling . one of the best pieces of advice that andrew solomon cites is from a greek philosopher who , more than 2000 years ago suggested that sufferers enjoy good wine and food , and surround themselves with good friends . a humane and enormously rich piece of science writing
