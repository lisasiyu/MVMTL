one of the best books ever ... this is one of the best books ever ... .i noted that a women said that we complain about racism in this country and do not truly understand what discriminate is ... i am grasping that she was european america ( i.e . white ethnic , white , fair skinned whatever you want to call it ) ... .i ask you this have your people ever been inslaved for nearly 400 years , have your people ever had attempts of racial/cultural genocides ... is it deeply ingrained in society that your people are lazy , inferior intellectually , etc ... .you would not even begin to understand , typical white person syndrome ... do n't walk around stupid your whole life ... . fyi ... this is just the tip of the iceberg , i would love to intellectually cruise your stupid ideals , you do n't begin to know sufferings ... continue to read some books and maybe you can something from them..
