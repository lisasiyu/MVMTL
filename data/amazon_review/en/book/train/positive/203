the book that started it all ! in this particular edition of the communist manifesto , the reader is treated to an introduction by leon trotsky , one of the central leaders of the russian revolution as well as some correspondence from marx and engels . but it is the manifesto itself which bears repeated readings and discussion . how could such a short work have been the basis for revolutions around the world ? it is due i think to the fundamental points made : i.e . that workers of the world must unite -- -as they have more in common with each other than their own national rich and powerful . in very brief but cogent explanations , marx and engels give a concise history of mankind and prove that all history in the `` history of class struggles '' . be it feudal lords and serfs or autoworkers and general motors , it is still the truth . if you ca n't get this book from amazon , try books by pathfinder under the `` new and used '' button above
