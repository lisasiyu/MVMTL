a great grounding in the knowledge of electric car conversion i have an interest in all environmental solutions , but from a more technical side and i was searching for an economical mode of transport , which could also be an ongoing project for the future months . `` convert it '' is a great read and it really shows you the basic rules and tips in both technical detail but in a user friendly layout . i would recommend it as a great starting block and as an essential library piece for any future electric car-converting enthusiast
