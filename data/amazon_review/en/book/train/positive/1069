a powerful little book ... this book holds a lot of thought for only 130 pages . franz metcalf takes his knowledge of buddhism to answer now just the big questions of `` life '' , but the smaller questions of daily life . what would buddha do or think about such subjects as failure , anger , road rage , gun control , lying , the environment , eating meat , money , sex , drinking , drug abuse , boredom and even prostitution . hard issues , but each is given a page , answered with a quote from buddhist teaching and advice from the author . great gift for a friend or a gift for yourself . it really helps you strip away the fat and get to the very core of the subject in question
