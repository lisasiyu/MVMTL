put the bite back into liberal politics in this book , ted rall has as much criticism for the democrats as for the republicans . predictably , rall goes after the republicans for their hate filled rhetoric and their disregard for future generations of americans . the republican party is cashing in now , but future generations will have to pay off the mounting debt ( i thought conservatives were supposed to be fiscally responsible types ) . what may be even worse , the republicans are alienating people and nations all over the world . sure , we 're the superpower now , but nothing lasts forever . do you want other nations to give us a helping hand or kick us when we 're down ? that depends on how we treat other nations now , while we have power . pre-emptively invading countries does n't win any brownie points . the democrats get criticized for being too moderate and too nice . instead of using the same dirty tricks and viscious political rhetoric that the republicans use , the democratic party just sits back and takes the blows . this is n't good for the image of the party . also , rall believes that the democratic party is too disorganized . there is no central message for liberals everywhere . there are only small groups who only care about their own issues . if the democrats hope to come back to power , they 're going to have to get their act together . this book is an interesting read for those who consider themselves free thinkers
