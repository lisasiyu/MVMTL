an excellent introduction to stochastic calculus this my recommendation for people who want to learn stochastic calculus for the first time . the virtue of this book is that it keeps matters simple , well grounded , and intuitive enough to hook the newcomers in the subject . once you get comfortable enough and want to learn technical detail necessary for scholarly research , there are other excellent expositions such as karatzas and shreve ( 1998 ) and protter ( 1990 ) . some reviews complained that this book is limited to stochastic integration with respect to brownian motion , but that is precisely why i recommend this book . by starting with browning motion readers can form concrete mental image of stochastic integration and get ready to stride to more general setting if necessary . another virtue of this book is the plenty ( easy ) exercise problems . working through them is perhaps the best way to learn stochastic calculus .
