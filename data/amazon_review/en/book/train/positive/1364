the most useful cookbook ever many cookbooks are tempting to read but impractical to cook from every day . this one on the other hand is full of fast , easy , and delicious recipies that are great for kids and adults . i have never made anything from this book that did n't dissapear at the table ; the microwave carmel corn is especially good . this is an outstanding book to get for your self or to give as a gift to any mom or dad
