familiarity breeds comfort in the classics rosemary sutcliff excels at story telling by making the epic story of the iliad understandable and thrilling to a seven year old . i have read this book to my son at least three times , beginning when he was seven years old . he is now so familiar with the story and characters of the iliad as a result of black ships before troy that to read homer 's iliad will simply mean meeting these familiar characters again . sutcliff 's writing is so engaging that parents as well will enjoy this book . an absolute bonus is the excellent illustrations by alan lee
