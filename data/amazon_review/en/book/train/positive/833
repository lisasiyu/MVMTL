a derridean orientalism mitchell 's writing , as stated in the reviews , takes the scholarship begun by heidegger and continued by derrida and foucault and applies it to his critique of 19th century colonialism . the ideas of deconstruction and its fight to overturn both complete objectivity and the hope of & quot ; overcoming the system & quot ; lead mitchell to demonstrate that the west and its objectivity is rooted in as much subjectivity as any other cultural perspective . it is this western rationale that brought european colonialists to impose their values and hierarchies onto the oriental system , bringing the power structures of foucault 's discourses to the fore . whatever conclusion you come to take from the book , and mitchell 's arguments are exceptionally convincing , you will certainly not leave its pages with the same mindset you entered
