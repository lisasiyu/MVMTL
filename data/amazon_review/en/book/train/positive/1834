power to the people my initial interest in the book was a result of an accident . i stumbled upon a television program where 2 guys in suits are being interviewed in a park . the comparisons between a starfish and i spider compelled me to purchase the book . simply stated , the starfish and the spider is an excellent book . management styles and corporate culture are not spellbinding topics , however the authors present the subject matter clearly with historical and present day references . i use craigslist and could easily relate to the sense of community . this book is a must read for those in business brick n ' mortar or an internet based ; for those with a desire to understand how a college student , with an idea for sharing music , brought an industry to it 's knees
