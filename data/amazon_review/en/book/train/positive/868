another winner from mr. parish this is a fascinating book about one of the best ( relatively ) young directors working . as usual , mr. parish has done his homework . the background material is great and helps give a really vivid picture of the person . i really feel i got to know mr. van sandt from reading this book , not only him , but his family and associates growing up . the descriptions of his early works are especially interesting . mr. parish is one of the most thorough writers when it comes to work credits of his subjects . i also enjoy this section of his books . i definitely recommend this book
