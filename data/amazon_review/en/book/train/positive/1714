excellent read - some of the best in this genra it has been some years since this one hit the shelves , but it is non the worse for wear . actually , i have to agree with another reviewer in that i too , feel this is one of wambaugh 's best . a true sory , brought to light in a very readable story like format . it is rather unforgetable . the author does a very good job of not only telling us a story ( wambaugh is , after all , first and formost a great story teller ) , but gives us great insight into the thoughts and motivations of the killers . he gives us a wonderful profile of the oung officer who survived this horrible crime . i can not in all truth say it is as good as `` in cold blood , '' but it comes pretty close to the mark . recommend this one highly .
