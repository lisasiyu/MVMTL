beautifully written the `` thief lord '' is a wonderful contemporary story full of loss , beauty , adventure and a little bit of magic . cornelia funke 's book has one several literary prizes and even bumped harry potter off the best sellers list in germany and northern europe for a time . it never talks down to kids and is engaging to adults as well . the imagery of venice is dead-on ( just like i remembered ) and the characters ( prosepero , scipio ) are richly portrayed . this is a story that is light on the fantastic but heavy on imagery and imagination just like the classics ! the main protaganists are boys but boys and girls can enjoy this book equally as there are a few standout female characters also . geared to young readers 8-12 and also adults
