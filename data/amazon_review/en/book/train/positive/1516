faceless professor swain wrote an incredible account of both black and white representatives of african-americans ( both minority and majority districts ) in the us congress . she examines the history of blacks in congress , the definition of & quot ; black interests , & quot ; and the difference between black descriptive and substantive representation . the book was originally written between the 1990 general election and the 1992 presidential election . although this may seem to make the book out of date , dr. swain updated her manuscript with an addendum to the first edition . this chapter covers the republican sweep of the 1994 general election and discusses its consequences to black descriptive and substantive representation . 'black faces , black interests ' can be highly relevent to the historically minded , as the facts of the past shape the future . in this end , the author can have the most impact by educating readers , thus possibly touching the future representatives of african-americans
