a must have for the mystery connoisseur ! this is a wonderful tool to keep track of all those mystery books on your shelves . this book offers a comprehensive listing of women 's fiction mysteries . books are listed by author and title . it is great way to see the order of books written in a series . there is also a check list where you can check off the book once you purchase it , and then check it after you read it . i like to make notations next to the books once i finish the book . books that have been nominated or received awards are designated with a star by the title
