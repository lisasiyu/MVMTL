my infant smiles whenever he sees this book we have enjoyed another of eric carle 's books -- brown bear brown bear what do you see -- since my son was a few weeks old . so , when my son was about 7 months old , i bought from head to toe . it was a wonderful purchase ! after a few reads , my son was imitating the animals just like his mama -- waving his arms like a monkey and on his hands and knees like the cat . it was so wonderful for me to see that my son was understanding and processing the books i read to him .
