amazing reading experience i first borrowed this book from the library . i read it and had to own it . i do not ever purchase books , i borrow them . the writting is amazing . that is the only word that even comes close to describing the experience of reading this book . the feelings i felt while reading traveling light went from one end of the spectrum to the other . awesome
