the best way to greenlight your project in her book web thinking , successful hollywood screenwriting consultant and author of numerous books on the entertainment industry , dr. linda seger reveals the real secret to success in any job . she hits the nail on the head -- it 's about relationships . in my years as a performance improvement specialist to fortune 100 corporations , 80 % of success was not just showing up ( like woody allen has said ) , nor is it technical competence and know-how ( as our school systems wrongly assume ) , but rather the establishment of mutually beneficial relationships with our peers , our suppliers and our customers . people get jobs and lose them primarily because their egos are too big to help others succeed . or as seger puts it , we need to be `` connecting , not competing . '' regardless , listen to the interviews with a-listers in any industry . more often it 's not the project that creates the critical mass for a greenlight , but how much one person wants to work with another . linda 's writing was very helpful in the writing of my own book on screenwriting published by michael wiese productions : the moral premise : harnessing virtue and vice for box office success
