excellent book for beginners and experts once again , tom rosenbauer delivers a clearly-written , practical , and insightful book on fly-fishing . this time he looks at tying and gives many practical tips -- especially on the use of tools and materials . for example , a beginner is hit with all these tools -- which ones are best , which ones to use , etc . rosenbauer gives clear descriptions of which tools are most useful , what they 're used for , and which ones you do n't really need . at the same time , he gives tips from his experience -- also useful for the expert . the bulk of the book is , of course , the fly-tying receipes . he provides many photographs of each step in making a fly . the many photos are probably more than the expert will need , but very important for a beginner . for the expert , you get many great fly receipes . overall , highly recommended fly-tying guide
