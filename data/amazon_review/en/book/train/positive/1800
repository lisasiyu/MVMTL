the best book i 've read this year be prepared to weep at the end but this novel is beautiful . writing is superb and the characters are not only believable but they stay with you long after you close the book . anjali is waiting for her husband , prakash , to pick her up after a trip to her parents . prakash does n't show and anjali faces a life-changing situation as a result . anjali divorces , remarries and has a son , amar . the story weaves their fragile lives with a past that comes into the present . chapters are short and moving ; each brought across by the character 's feelings and thoughts . ca n't say enough good about this story . remember your kleenex and get ready for a novel to stay with you
