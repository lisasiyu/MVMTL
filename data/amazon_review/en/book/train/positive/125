not lewis 's best , but still a great book about silicon valley reading this book , you get the impression michael lewis just moved in with jim clark for a year . sadly , these direct interaction stories and anecdotes are not as compelling as the more standard journalistic backstory : the tale of clark 's rise from abject poverty , the founding of silicon graphics and his eventual war with management and the board there , and the story of netscape . the up to date stuff is less interesting , unless you are really fascinated with big sailboats . if we were rating lewis books on a scale of 1-5 , this would only rate a 3 . but since other authors have to also fit into the scale , this gets a 4..
