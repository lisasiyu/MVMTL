for designers , directors and academics this book , one of the few that takes a more academic , rather than practical , view of scenic design , should be required reading for any designer ( lights and costumes as well as set ) as well as every director . in his designer profiles aronson shows the reader the different processes that can be utilized to achieve a successful design . it is also one of the few books that gives the reader an opportunity to get deeper into the history of contemporary american design , as each designer is sure to mention his or her influences and teachers . far more useful then the practical books on design in helping a young designer conceptualize , collaborate and create interesting designs . unless you want to design in a vacuum , this book is a must rea
