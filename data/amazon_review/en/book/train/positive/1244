one of walters ' best the scold 's bridle , in my opinion , is one of minette walters ' best mysteries -- at least one of her best i 've read so far ! her characters are well-developed , and the reader does n't know from one page to the next who the murderer could be -- no one liked mathilda , it seemed . throughout the police investigation , readers are faced with learning of mathilda gillispie 's abusive and haunting background of secrets , lies , and deception . mathilda 's character , though dead as the story begins , is developed more fully through her diary entries interspersed between chapters . having left all of her money to an unlikely person , her doctor susan blakeney , mathilda 's daughter and granddaughter are brought into the story assuming they would inherit mathilda 's wealth . readers find that mathilda 's daughter and granddaughter have experienced much of the intense emotional and physical abuse as mathilda had . this part of the story , no doubt , leaves readers pondering how abuse often perpetuates itself through generations . walters does n't let on who the murderer is , and i 'll admit , i was a little disappointed in its resolution given that the novel seemed more focused in a different direction . overall , i enjoyed this novel moreso than the ice house or the sculptress , but they are all very good books , and i would wholeheartedly recommend walters to readers wanting a good mystery
