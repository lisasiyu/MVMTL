very interestingly confusing this book ( the cover amazon has displayed is *wrong* ) is very interesting . it is also exceedingly strange . it was never boring , but it never made too much sense either . you think there might be supernatural elements involved -- but maybe not . it 's a tale of the coming to america from england , the stuff that happens to the british here , and indians . cool , confusing , book
