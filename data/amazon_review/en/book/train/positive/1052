really just fantasic ! when i first saw this book in the bookstore , i debated about getting it for about a month . the moment i bought , i regretted it . this book was so fanastic , you should n't hesitate ! the back cover makes the book sound stupid , and the front cover art is slightly freaky , but the book itself was actually really , really good . masterful writing combined with poetic development of characters and setting makes the novel flow . the transtitions and changes that the main characters have to go through , the challenges they face , and the triumphs and discoveries that they encounter will have you devouring the book in a day or less . honeslty , do n't hesitate when thinking about buying this book . it will become a treasured piece of your collection
