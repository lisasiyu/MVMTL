breathing extraordinary truths into ordinary lives i read this novel because it won the pulitzer prize for fiction . anne tyler has a gift for portraying ordinary indivdiuals who live ordinary lives . yet her novel is anything but ordinary because her characters are simple , yet real and their dialogue rings true . moreover , ms. tyler , like hardy and miller before her , clearly believes and successfully posits that her mundane characters are heroic because they survive , perservere and present ( albeit unknowingly ) moral and spiritual lessons that are universal to us all . but my hesitation in giving this novel 5 stars is that , while it is great fiction , it is not the greatest fiction of its time . and this raises another issue . why have so many pulitzer prize novels , such as `` gilead , '' `` the known world , '' `` empire falls , '' `` the hours , '' `` kavalier & clay , '' and `` middlesex , '' disappointed me recently ? while these are compelling and at times superb works , they are not , in my opinion , deserving of the pulitzer prize . of recent winners , only `` the shipping news '' merits that distinction . perhaps i will focus on national book award winners , since they seem more uniformly satisfying .
