laughs galore this is the third bill bryson travelogue i have read . this has several laugh-out-loud sections , particularly if you have travelled in the united kingdom . it is excellent for relaxing on weekends or on a plane . if you have never been to the uk and do n't know any british people , then do n't form all your opinions based on this one book , but bryson does a good job distilling some of the differences between our nations into an amusing few hundred pages .
