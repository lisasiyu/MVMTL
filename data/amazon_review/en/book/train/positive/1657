from a skeptic for a navy guy like me to admit that i read a selp help book is hard enough , but to share how much i loved it with millions of people i think is even harder ! my wife forced me to start reading this book `` relationships : gifts of the spirit '' but after about ten pages she could n't have taken it away from me if she tried . i started with chapter eight because it was the chapter on `` war '' . i was expecting the normal war stuff , but instead i got a lesson in something much more important . i have started to learn how to listen to my body through pain and sickness . i never thought back and neck pain were anything more that a nuisance , but the author tells me in her book that they are messages . maybe that five mile run was too much , maybe fighting with my wife or avoiding phone calls from my mother was not the best course of action and the only way my body knew to tell me was to make me feel pain . i have since recommended this book to all of the guys ! it 's not what you expect from a book about relationships
