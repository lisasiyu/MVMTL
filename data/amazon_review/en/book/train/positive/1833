another treasure this much anticipated 2nd title for o'brien is also full of truly solid encouragement of character for every little hero ready to defend his castle . garland 's genius is remarkable ! on the second page , his awesome illustration is sooo designed for little boys ! the only drawback of this book is that it includes the father quite a bit , where i 'd be your princess left the mother out . i was expecting this book to be the ideal title for single mothers , but i 'm afraid it must be designed with a whole family unit in mind . i wholeheartedly recommended it anyhow , because god is the father to the fatherless , and the relationship between the boy and his father can easily be examined that way ! good for mothers and sons of all ages
