advice of sibling true - they get better and better my little brother passed away at just 17 years old on july 25th , and i remember when i first started reading year 4 , he said that each book only get 's better and i have a long way to go . yes , it took me nearly three months to read this novel , but not because i 'm that slow of a reader . more likely , the story and characters were so interesting that i preferred dragging out each chapter to save myself from moving forward to year 5 . year 4 was an excellent read with plenty of potter goodness , not to mention the building plot 's twists and turns , and the mysteries it would take a sherlock holmes to solve . forget holmes ... it 's all potter and gang in this forth book by j.k. rowling . as a reader , i highly recommend and back the series . as for my brother if he can read this from afar , man i miss you and i 'm enjoying reading the stories you told me about . thanks
