the best of marquez one of my favorite books . i read this again a couple of months ago . florentino ariza 's 50 year unrequited love for the haughty fermina daza is an amazing allegory of human love . when fermina marries another man , florentino does n't ever give up . doggedly he spends his life planning for their eventual getting together . in a way he is a ridiculous don quixote , undaunted by reality , pining over a lost cause . somehow this bizarre little man hopes on . no , he does n't hope . he insists . he becomes president of the local shipping company , he redecorates his childhood home with his love in mind , his love of the arts mirrors his love for her . why does this work ? marquez is just a genius . he simply lets the characters tell their story and he writes down their words . and so they come to life
