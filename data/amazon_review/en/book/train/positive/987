best of the best were you to read only one wodehouse book ( god forbid ) which one might it be ? i would suggest this one , although there are numerous contenders from the jeeves , drones , golf , mr. mulliner and blandings stories , not to mention the one-offs and great unknowns . although this book has what might be called an overarching narrative , being that all the tales are told in the first person by one bertie wooster , the chapters nevertheless neatly fall out as short stories even if with somewhat `` cliffhanger '' endings , which is to say they do n't resolve . that almost perfect format will delight both short story fans and afficianados of the novel , and also spun off some of the best tv yarns in the jeeves and wooster and world of wodehouse tv series . my british edition ( for copyright reasons not for sale in the u.s. ) shows a cover photo op of ian carmichael as wooster in the bbc series `` the world of wooster '' . as pgw noted , this was one of many instances where bertie was overly mature and greyed ; there seems a deliberate attempt to make carmichael seem older -- whereas most readers , wodehouse included , see him as somewhat youngish . in wodehouse playhouse , which includes brief vignettes of pgw , he gives his imprimatur to the series for at least casting bertie somewhat younger . even better was the stellar performance in jeeves and wooster , in which `` pearls mean tears '' `` comrade bingo '' and a number of these other chapters , expanded into episodes , appear . no wonder such a wonderful series was inspired by such a delightful read
