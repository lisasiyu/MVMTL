a masterpiece , sadly forgotten , worth reviving recently , i have read a lot of books on creativity and innovation . my big surprise is that virtually none of them mention koestler 's the act of creation . this is unfortunate because this book is probably the most authoritative examination of creativity . attention to this classic is worth reviving . koestler examines three types of creativity - humor , science , and poetry . humor , according to him , is cruel ( a valuable insight ) . poetry , and other forms of art , integrate oneself with the world . science occupies the neutral middle . it is amazing how koestler manages to link all three kinds of creativity with a common framework . my two biggest take-aways from this book are regarding the process of creation and its form . as koestler describes beautifully - `` ..uncovers , selects , re-shuffles , combines , synthesizes already existing facts , ideas , faculties , skills . the more familiar the parts , the more striking the new whole . '' this is corroborated by all geniuses who have stood `on the shoulder of giants ' . even inventors like edison fit this framework . this is close to saying that instead of thinking `outside the box ' , link several boxes to each other . the other great insight is that the final breakthrough is rarely verbal , but in images . so people see new insights in a dream-like trance , rather than expressing it in language . language , probably , impedes creativity . there are several more delightful and relevant insights on creativity in this masterpiece . nearly a bible on creativity .
