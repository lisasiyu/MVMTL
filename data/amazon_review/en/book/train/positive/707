a review on the author although the book is great , it speaks for itself and i 'm not here to review it . i emailed the author , or someone who works with her , at the email address i got from jan 's website . first of all , a little background . i have a two-year-old border collie/lab who i 've had since he was seven weeks . i adore him . i have been working from home with the occasional temp job up until two months ago . i now work 5 days a week outside the house . i wrote to this person asking advice on certain things relating to walking the dog , and mentioned the hours my dog is being left alone while i 'm at work . my response was that i am & quot ; selfish & quot ; and unfit to have a dog . this coming from someone who was once so clueless about raising dogs that she put one of her own to sleep . i have been looking into getting a dogwalker for my pooch , which as a person concerned for dogs , she could have suggested . but her only suggestion was my poor dog , i should n't have him . whereas the book is a good read with good methods , i would suggest a second thought before asking her or her staff any questions personally . she , or whoever that was , is rather selective in the dogs she 'll help according to what she thinks of their owners . it was a negative experience trying to get any kind of advice from them . rather than pointing out something wrong and offering suggestions to rectify it to someone who is obviously open to change , she chose instead to say , sorry ! not interested ! not at all what i had in mind for someone in her position and with her passion
