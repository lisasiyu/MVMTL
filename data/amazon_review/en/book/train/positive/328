how ironic that this , one of the best in the series , follows what is probably the worst in the series . i 've read the left behind series twice , and , both times , i blazed through 'armageddon ' . in my honest opinion , it was one of the best in the series . why ? simply due to logical progression . when one of the main characters make a stupid and fatal mistake , we are taken on a journey with them . when another one of the 'heroes ' makea stupid move in judgment , we are taken on the journey with them . when one of the longtime main characters in the series decides to step into the warzone , he is not in the middle of some act of god that will save his life . armageddon is simply one of the wildest books in the series and relies on very little , if any , use of deus ex machina to bail out the stupid main characters . true , the writing is still simple and the characters even simpler , but by this point , you should alreayd know that . the thing about armageddon that makes it so good is the pace it moves . it 's both frenetic and painstaking at the same time . how is this possible ? because we are constantly switching from different points of view . however , each one of them is an ordeal of suffering ( especially for the haters of lb that have stupidly stuck with the story for so long ... either they have no life , are very , very hopeful , or are too ashamed to admit that they , too , love this story ) . bottom line - things happen in this book . after the turd that was 'the remnant ' , where virutally nothign of note happened , 'armageddon ' puts all the pieces on the board for the final battle in 'glorious appearing ' . i should also mention that the title may be a bit misleading . this book simply introduces armageddon , and the first few battle of the great war ; 'glorious appearing ' is the grand finale where it all happens . in any case , thumbs way up for 'armageddon '
