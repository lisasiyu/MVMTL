excellent book i bought this book 4 months ago because as an aspiring chef i have the need to learn as much as possible for lack of teachers in my area . i have learned how to make mayonaise , most of the basic sauces and the pate and the crowd pleaser , turkey gallantine . i am thrilled to have this book amongst her other books in my collection which i refer to daily . i recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to learn from the masters ( as there is not very many of them left ) the art of cooking and making french and any other type of food . as for people who claim some sort of health knowledge like tereshina ( which she obviously does not posses ) , i think she is one of those bitter people that needs to add some sugar and spice to her already depressing and pathethic life or better yet keep eating that darn styrofoam junk
