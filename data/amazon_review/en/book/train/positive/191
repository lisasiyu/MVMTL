great story ; very depressing , but very well written . the corrections is the tale of the lambert family , a pretty standard late 20th century midwestern family . alfred lambert , the father , suffers from an array of old-age medical disorders . his wife , enid , lives in denial of his ( and her own ) problems and thrusts her frustration upon their now-grown children : chip , the failed academic turned new york screenwriter , denise , the sexually confused upscale cook in philadelphia and gary , the maritally frustrated investment banker in philly . the plot follows the three children 's lives as the fall apart , seemingly in sync with the collapse of alfred 's health . the story is driven by enid 's desire to have her three children return home for alfred 's `` last '' christmas . franzen does an amazing job of carefully winding the story together , introducing fun moments of `` aha ! '' to the reader . recurring themes and motifs include mind altering drugs , the boom of the late 1990s , and the former soviet bloc . secondary characters connect primary characters together via seemingly random ( yet believable ) relationships . i found this novel an interesting read , but i had a hard time getting through it . the novel , at times , is horribly depressing . the relationships of gary , denise , and chip are painful to read , although maybe that 's what makes this novel so captivating at times - you can really identify with the characters . i think , at one point or another , we 've all been a gary , denise , chip or enid
