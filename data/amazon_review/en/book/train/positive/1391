most powerful book this side of the bible you will ever read this is the hardback unabriged edition . having both , let me highly recomend the unabriged . let not the size scare you it is written in a manner so friendly as to be able to read a chapter lay it meditate pick it up 3 weeks later and read another . the chapters even the subsections can stand on their own not needing the before or after sections to be blessed with what you are then reading . i spent five years reading the book not because it is hard but because it is so clear and the sentences so full as to make you pause and say yes that is right , amen , let me rejoice in this awhile . i would some times not be able to get back to it for weeks . pick it up where i left off with outhaving to review the previous section to regain and uderstanding of what i was reading . now i have to review lois lamore to do the same i am not that smart but this writer is that clear and plain . i recomend you skip the intro by r c sproul ( a great man ) and just begin with gurnall writeing , you will not be disappointed . god bless and he does and will bless you as you read the christian in complete armour . the most bible filled book ever written apart from the bible it self
