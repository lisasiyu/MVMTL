them pesky skeeters get a tale of their own i do n't recommend this book to the mosquito lovers of the world . if you 've a soft place in your heart for those buzzing swarming little blood-sucking fiends , you probably should n't peruse this particular book . however . if you happen to enjoy a good `` why '' story from africa , you could hardly do better than the lushly illustrated `` why mosquitoes buzz in people 's ears '' . in a kind of chicken little series of events , a lying mosquito sets off a chain reaction ending , ultimately , in the sun no longer rising . when the animals of the forest slowly track down the reasons behind the sun 's disappearance , they eventually reach the conclusion that mosquito is the one to blame . ever since , mosquitoes will sometimes ask people whether or not `` everyone '' is still angry at them . the answer is a satisfying ( i love this descriptive sound ) kpao ! the illustrations are splendid . during the day they are set against a white background . by the time the sun disappears , they pop out of a black setting . kids will like finding the small smiling pink bird that cleverly pops up in every scene . it 's a fine fine text that bears more than a passing resemblance at times to the classic nursery rhyme `` the house the jack built '' . and who knew that the sound lions make when they laugh is `` nge nge nge '' ? not i , said the fly . a lovely read
