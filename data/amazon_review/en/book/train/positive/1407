only a rightwing lunatic would hate this book the truth is our society feeds into the so-called need for guns for everything . it is no wonder we 're actually losing the real war on terrorism and further undermining national security . the people who hate this book seem to find it ok to read and listen to gun toting rightwing propaganda all the time . yes , my state is a gun toting state but that does n't mean that none of these people want a little safety once in a while . gun control and gun violence are two different issues altogether despite the nra 's and the rightwing attempts to lump them together . read this book and remember this quote from atticus finch of `` to kill a mockingbird '' : `` courage is when you know you 're licked before you begin , but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what . .. courage is not a man with a gun in his hand . real courage is when you fight for what is right regardless of whether you win or lose .
