beatrice lives on the book opens with both beatrice 's illegitimate children living together as cousins . john macandrew is away trying to get his fortune back after beatrice stole it all in an effort to keep wideacre for her children . julia and richard early on seem to represent the good and bad beatrice . julia resembles beatrice , and she has her excellent horse riding skills , plus the ability to farm and work the land . all those were `` the good beatrice . '' richard only has the insatiable hunger to keep wideacre for himself and pass it on to his heir . he does n't care about anything or anybody else . this represents `` the bad beatrice . '' at the end of wideacre all beatrice could think about was raising enough money to secure wideacre for her heirs , and she turned a blind eye to the poverty and sickness that she was causing . i like how philippa gregory weaves historical facts into the story , such as how the poor had to live in order to survive , and how the landowners made such unfair laws , and how they controlled the courts . the parts of the book that were really aggravating to me were the ones where julia had absolutely no backbone whatsoever ... . especially after richard rapes her . i think celia and john would definitely have believed her , not richard . i have really liked every philippa gregory book , whether from the other boleyn girl series or the wideacre series . i 'm looking forward to reading the last book , meridon .
