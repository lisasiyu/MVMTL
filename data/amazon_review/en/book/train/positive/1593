review of the voices most of these reviews address the book not how the production did with its presentation of the book . my opinion , it was wonderful . i know its a generalization but i wish more audio books were like this , like old 50 's radio shows . it makes the book become alive . the casting was well-done . the voices are what i imagined them to be , maybe better . if only one person was narrorating this book ( like most are done now ) then this book probably would n't be as much fun to listen to on cd . so , if you have a choice to either listen to one voice or many voices with some amusing sound effects , pick the latter
