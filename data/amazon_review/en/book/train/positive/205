lao 's review the secret history is a record of the mongolian royal families , which is thought to have been written during the thirteenth century . paul kahn has kept the original prose format in his translation , which i feel makes this the only version to own . it begins with the creation myth of the wolf and deer from which the mongolian people ( in legend ) are descended from ; throught he birth of temujin , and ending with the ascention to the throne of ogedai khan . i highly recommend this to those who are looking for primary sources to add to their asian history collections
