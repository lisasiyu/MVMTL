not his absolute best work ... but good this book is entertaining . it is not as enthralling like other books sheldon has written such as the conspiracy theory , the stars shine down or nothing lasts forever . i found myself bored at times when reading this and then in a & quot ; ca n't put it down & quot ; mode at other times . if you are a sheldon fan , it is worth reading , but if you are new to this author try a different title first . he is an exceptional story teller
