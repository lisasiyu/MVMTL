amazing gracie : a dog 's tale by dan dye being an animal lover , a volunteer dog walker at our local shelter and a cat owner , i always read non-fiction books relating to animals and amazing gracie will be one of my favorites that i will remember . the author 's writing made it so i did n't want to put the book down , it made me laugh , cry , and educated about adopting an all natural diet for our pets . it prompted me to purchase the other three books about `` three dog bakery '' to learn more and as i already knew , people who love animals can make wonderful things happen in their lives as well as their pets . now we need a `` three dog bakery '' in milwaukee , wisconsin
