information , not judgement if your interested in a healthy diet , of any type , this book is a must . for those already or considering vegetarianism , i have not yet found anything that compares . this book focuses on the `` how to be healthy '' and leaves preaching ( in things one may or may not agree with ) aside , so it is an awesome source for everyone . omnivores and veggie/vegans ( health , ar , environmentalist or any mix ) will feel comfortable reading and reaping the benefits from this book . in depth but easy to understand explanations of basic dietary needs , info from many studies , and how to make the most of this info in one 's everyday eating habits . it takes time to explain the macronutrients ( to include protein requirements and essential amino acid intake ) , individual minerals and vitamins , essential fatty acids and more . a book that i 'm extremely pleased to have come across and to have in my library
