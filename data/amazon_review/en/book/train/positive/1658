a most amusing memoir content aside , whether or not you are interested in the nixon administration , this is a wondeful memoir written in a very readable yet elegant style . i suspect that safire had the earl of clarendon leaning over his shoulder when he wrote this . it 's full of wonderful character studies of the major and minor players in the administration . safire is not enitirely candid in what he writes and he does pull his punches , but if you are good at reading between the lines , it 's all there . a very enjoyable read . each chapter focuses on a person or key event during the years . watergate is covered but only tangentally
