the pool party by gary soto , robert casilla ( illustrator ) i believe that third and fourth graders would really enjoy this text about this mexican american youngster . children would also enjoy the occasional spanish included in the text . the only problem : soto does not include a glossary this time . oh well , soto does a great job of portraying a family that understands what it means to really work for a living and teaches kids not to take everything for granted . soto stays away from the sterotypical `` lazy mexican ''
