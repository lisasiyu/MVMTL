loren pope was right ! ! ! after a personal large university experience back in the 60 's , i knew that that was not what i wanted for my children . we found mr. pope 's book and the lights came on . not only did we use the book , but with some diligent work were able to arrange personal counseling sessions with mr. pope for both my son and daughter . we live in central texas and my son just graduated from whitman college in walla walla , washington and my daughter is now a senior at kalamazoo college in michigan . they both looked at quite a few schools , both recommended in the book and not : grinnell , reed , colorado college , beloit , lawrence , colgate , college of wooster , williams & bowdoin . my son loved whitman . it is a beautiful school in a beautiful part of america . it is not easy . he was challenged . there is a great respect between the college and the town of 30,000 . ( to parents : walla walla is a great place to visit . there are 50+ wonderful wine tasting rooms in the immediate area . ) my daugher also is happy with her choice at kzoo . the winters are cold for a texas girl , but the personal attention that so many of the professors have given to her and her friends is amazing . the k study abroad program which is 65 years old and rated among the best in the nation for all colleges was fabulous for her . she spent six months in ecuador and loved it . our nephew , also from texas , will be leaving for six months in thailand in another good program . loren was right . these schools do provide personal attention and are there to make sure their students succeed
