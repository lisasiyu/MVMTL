yummy food for everyone ! i know , i know , i am the daughter of the author but i have to say something about the book . ( remember one can be objective about a family member ) . first the quality of the food : i have been cooking a lot of these recipes - some for the past 15 years and they are something to be proud of ! really delicious and so easy . exceptional recipes ( which i literally dream about ) include : lima bean & amp ; pea puree , the meat loaf , the split pea soup , the rice pilaf , the bourbon cake , the red velvet cake and the chicken fricassee . just to name a few . second the variety of foods and recipes : which is a tribute to the author and her life experiences and are truly diverse ! just look at how many cultures and countries are represented here . finally , tom eckerle 's photographs : which are exquisite and transforms the book into not only a well-worn cookbook but a & quot ; coffeetable book & quot ; as well . my hats off to you , mom . i 'm proud of you . how nice of you to share with everyone
