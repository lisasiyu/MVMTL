the garden of eden i find rousseau especially creative in the way he describes how inequality progressed from the time the first humans made contact . he makes a good case for the solitary life . i think rousseau believes it is destructive whenever humans come together in groups . governments were formed to protect the weaker from the stronger or as rousseau thinks to actually protect the rich from the poor . this is an outstanding book . it will haunt you
