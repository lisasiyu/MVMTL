refreshing & wonderful i actually listened to the audio book read by the author . she does a great job as a reader which usually is n't the case when an author reads her own work , in my experience . it 's great to read about someone 's lovely and loving childhood for a change , and it 's not boring ! far from it . i laughed out loud , and cried from being moved by beauty instead of tragedy . do n't miss this one
