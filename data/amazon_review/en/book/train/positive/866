functional and fun ; the new knitting book i loved this book . i picked it up on a whim and spent the next two hours reading and laughing . the patterns are fun and these girls are so funny . i think this is a great book to have in my library . it has several patterns that i really want to make as gifts and i think even the book would make a great gift to any knitter
