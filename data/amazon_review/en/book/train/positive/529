enjoyable , and extremely well written to say the least i enjoyed this book tremendously . not only for the story itself , but because of the creativity of the writing . the way the story was told it is as if i had stood next to these characters throughout their lives and lived with them through their journey . and it is a journey we all have faced at one time or another . i have become a fan of mr. perronne , and the way he made his creation become a treasured part of my collection of books . i ca n't wait to read more from this very talented writer . a job well done !
