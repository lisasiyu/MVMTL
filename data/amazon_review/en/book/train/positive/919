a great book ! i have been waiting days for this book , and it finally came today . honestly , i expected it to have your standard sword exercises and cuts , but it contains stances and techniques that i have never even heard of , while some are familiar to me . thanks to having a hardwood bokuto ( which i also purchased off of this website ) , i can now incorporate new exercises into my practice . even though hatsumi-sensei is a ninja , he is well-versed in the culture of the samurai and the sword as well . i recommend it to all aspiring swordsmen
