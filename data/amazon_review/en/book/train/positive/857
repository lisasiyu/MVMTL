i loved this story i would have to say it has everything , and is highly readable , which i think is an important recommendation to give potential readers of classic fiction . it is beautiful , simple , filled with humor and compassion . i particularly liked the way hugo pokes fun at the absurdities of anti-gypsy prejudice and other social bigotry . esmerelda 's suitor , however , is a terrible selfish jerk in this story , which is far funnier and more believable than the selfless sap he plays in the disney movie . altogether an unforgettable read , and an unforgettable character in the hunchback , who hugo paints with considerable humanity
