bambi i purchased this book for my 8 year old who needed it for a school project . the vocabulary used in this book is a bit difficult . i also found it to be quite different than the disney movie and other written versions of the story . the author , felix salten , uses elaborate descriptions and you will feel as if you are actually in the woods with the deer ! i recommend this book , but please be aware that it is not `` sugar coated '' like the movie
