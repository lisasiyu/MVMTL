wife : `` best book i 've read in , like , years ! '' i bought `` one hundred demons '' as kind of a shot-in-the-dark gift for my wife . she ended up reading it all in one sitting and gave me her opinion . `` this book is , like , one of the best books i 've read in years ! you have to read it ! she even , like , gives you instructions in the back on how to paint your own demons ! '' buying a good gift without being given specific instructions is something i do once every 10 years maybe . i did it twice this year ( i also did good by buying her some thermal `` dog '' pajamas from target on a whim ) . i ended up reading it myself -- and i thought it was an awesome book . i could n't ( and still ca n't ) put it down either ! there are a lot of nuances that are very funny . lynda barry does a great job conveying personality and humanism . very colorful and fun to read . will likely buy more of her books -- i ( we ) need more than just one fix
