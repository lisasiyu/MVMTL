underworld underworld is an ambitious book . by examining politics , economics , and popular culture in the united states during the last half of the twentieth century , author don delillo engages in some interesting speculation about hidden meanings and connections that lie beneath our notice . in the world that he depicts , people and events sometimes seem to be connected by some kind of field or ether through which unnamable forces operate . in his opening scene , the lives of hundreds of thousands of people are joined by an historic baseball game , where a young man senses `` the body heat of a great city ... small reveries and desperations , the unseen something that haunts the day . '' in other passages of the book , these connections take the form of history or a system : `` that thing you feel in an office ... sensing the linked grids lap around you . '' the book focuses on nick shay , a man with some grit who escapes a meaningless life in the bronx and becomes an executive in a waste disposal firm and a kind of savant . it takes a long time and many people to produce this transformation , and this results in a pretty long book : 827 pages in the hard cover edition . delillo is even more interested in conspiracy theories and secrets than in nick 's personal transformation , so along the way he shares a lot of arcane knowledge with the reader about the nuclear weapons industry , environmental degradation , and j. edgar hoover . the connections between a few of the minor characters and subplots and the rest of the book are not obvious , and i would venture to say that a few of these could have been omitted without great harm . also , delillo 's dialogue has a definite style : his characters seem to hoard their words , and an awful lot of them do n't finish their sentences . whether these are defects or not probably depends on the reader 's tastes . for me , this is a much better book than delillo 's white noise and libra , which have been widely praised .
