excellent overview i found the book to be excellent . it accomplishes its main goals : to summarize the history of the world in an overview style . if you want to get into deep history , you can take some of the sections and delve further into other annals . as for other readers accusing the book of having a negative revisionist slant , i would disagree . modern scholarship is most definately revisionist , but that does n't have to be a bad thing . revisionist history is only a bad thing when there is an agenda for personal gain . to revise history based on new scholarship is a wonderful thing which can sometimes disprove earlier `` revisions '' to history
