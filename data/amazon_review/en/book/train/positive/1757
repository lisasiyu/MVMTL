difficult to start , difficult to put down i had this book on my shelf for a while before i cracked it open , knowing nothing about it except the synopsis on the back and that it came recomended from another book . the author goes into slight tangents of historical events -- at the beginning it seems pointless . after a while , you understand all the links , and begin to become very interested in this character that is much like many careless intellectual college drop outs who never found it fullfilling and always found themselves bound by the system . maybe i liked it because i identified with her -- almost too much -- even though she is far richer and always seeking to put herself in a situation most level headed people would n't . that 's what makes her facinating . in hind sight , i can see why many people did n't like it , but reading it , i was devoured by her smart writing style and the storyline . not until 3/4ths into the book you suspect anything out of the ordinary . suspensful , definately . the last chapter was kind of anticlimactic .
