excellent expository text in _the lacanian subject : between language and jouissance_ , bruce fink delivers a clear and comprehensive account of the notion of the subject as it operates in lacanian theory and clinical practice . the book 's focus , of course , is much broader than this : this is a text that could serve as a superb introduction to lacanian psychoanalysis , to be read while studying _ecrits_ and the seminar . he begins by elaborating lacan 's ideas on the subject 's entrance into language and the rules that govern the language as other . then he goes on to explicate the implications of this for subjectivity , ethics , sexuality , and psychoanalytic theory -- all the while staying true to the clinical roots of these concepts . fink provides clarification through the use of great examples , easy-to-follow schemas , a few of his own case histories , and by referring back to freud 's classic cases . this book really helped me understand some key issues in lacan 's theoretical constellation . if you need help wrestling with lacan 's texts , _the lacanian subject_ is recommended . also recommended : _a clinical introduction to lacanian psychoanalysis_ and _lacan to the letter_ , both by bruce fink
