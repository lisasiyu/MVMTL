possitive and incouraging i am about half way through the book and i have been greatly encouraged by it . when i am feeling down and read it it gives me some renewed strength . i am personally a realist and reality can get you down . i am from katrina ville which has been mentally challenging . it was hard loosing our home , business location and a lot of friends . although i was fully insured and we are doing well the realization that you can loose it all so fast is depressing . so many that have gone through it are not even as fortunate as i am . so many around the world would love to trade places with me . i am reading this one slowly and trying to absorb as much as i can . joel osteen has been able to reach me with his positive message when others just could n't . i want to read it again when i am finished
