for those who are 'white knuckling their way through sobriety ... ' as a talk show host i am accustom to being inundated with requests from pr folks trying to get me to book their particular client on my show to plug their book . since i did n't like my current events show to be a blatant advertisement for a writer , i generally delete these types of solicitation ... 25 times a day . in fact i had hit delete on the email regarding chris prentiss 's book just as my eye caught a phrase and i had to actually retrieve the message . it was the cure rate of better than 80 % that got my attention , and triggered my skepticism ... along with a tiny sliver of hope since i knew how many times friends and members of my own family had fallen off the wagon . i booked chris for 15 minutes and they sent me the book . a few days beforehand i thought i better skim the book so i could ask him some tough questions . i read the entire book and called the pr representative back and booked chris for the entire show . i think what hooked me was chris 's comment about observing an aa meeting where people were `white knuckling their way through sobriety '' . controversial statement . and true for too many . the book was specific about the path . find the underlying cause ( s ) . work on that . the true story of his son 's journey was engaging and encouraging . for weeks and months after the show i received emails and phone calls from listeners : `` what was the name of that guy again ? what 's the name of his book ? '' of all the shows and topics i have covered in 17 years on air , i have never received such a response .
