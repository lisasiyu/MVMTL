a true fire from the start ... `` shadowfires '' was another wonderful book in the long line of great koontz novels , and this one was no different . we have the story of a woman named rachel , and her husband , eric leben . eric was a doctor in genetics who was fighting with his wife until he is pushed in front of a bus , by her , and killed . rachel felt that maybe freedom was at last hers , until hours later , eric is missing from the morgue , and we learn the awful truth of his secret work . i felt that this book had action from the very first few pages , and did not stop until the very last word . i was thrilled with the roller coaster of a ride that koontz took me on , and i could not put the book down once i started on the journey . koontz makes great use of location , and our fears of within , to give us this great chiller of the experiments of man to be more than human . a definite gem in the koontz collection , a must have for any collector , and a great place to start for anyone taking a look at his work for the first time . a masterpiece . my only wish of this book : it should have been made into a movie . -c
