interesting history ... this was an interesting read . napolitano is a fox news contributor who is an advocate of interpreting via natural law and reading the constitution literally for it 's intended meaning . as a result , the fox news bashers will tend to ignore the book but it 's worthy of their attention too because the leftwing liberal idea of reinterpeting the constitution for today is what lead to legislation like the patriot act . in an unbiased way ( politically ) , his criticisms of the current administration are well-balanced with a good explanation and examples of abuse . i 've traditionally been a supporter of the republicans and the patriot act but the judge 's book have made me rethink the patriot act . i was also surprised at how far back in time some of the interpretation contraversies go , some dating back to hamilton and jefferson themselves
