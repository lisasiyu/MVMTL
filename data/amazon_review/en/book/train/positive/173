wow why is it so hard for us to give this man the credit he deserves ? we 've seen the movies and read the books . and yet , every time i see a book by john grisham in hangzhou , i think , `` i do n't have to finish reading it if i do n't like it . '' i think of his value as trade bait , since he 's so popular . and yet , i have never put aside a john grisham book unread . what more does he have to do ? become less popular ? the premise on the back cover is simple enough . a homeless guy takes nine lawyers hostage , somebody dies , and one of our lawyers is changed by the experience . you have no idea what an excellent novel can come from such a simple idea . i 've read almost everything grisham has written , and i can remember most of it , and i 'd have to put this at the top of the list . he 's a master of character , plotting , simplifying the complex , setting , words , and accessibility . the writer should do all the work so the reader does n't have to . john grisham , folks . he 's the genuine article . let 's say it , okay ?
