sheer brilliance i 've seen a few reviews here that say `` read it , but do n't go see it . '' most of the time , i would probably agree , because most people who do the play do n't get it ; they think it 's a straightforward comedy , and it is almost anything but . r & g is all about pace ; except for a couple of spots , if the pace is n't almost franticly precise , the end loses its entire effect . the beginning of the second act `` hmmm ? '' `` yes ? '' `` what ? '' `` i thought you ... '' `` no . '' `` ahh . '' takes a lot of work to get right ; someone missing a beat is almost as bad as someone walking through the invisible fourth wall . guildenstern has the first real line in the play : `` there 's an art to the building up of suspense . '' if you are n't on the edge of your seat when the penultimate scene begins , then the director and the actors have missed the boat . unfortunately , nothing mr stoppard has done since is quite as good . his plays are good , especially if you like the pinteresque types , but just not quite as good
