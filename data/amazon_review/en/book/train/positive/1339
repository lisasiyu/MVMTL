the book of wisdom for the ages maha means great and yoga means a path of reunion . here the great path is outlined and explained in a truly timeless and masterful way . written by a direct disciple of the great ramana maharshi , this is a very important guide book for the seeker of ultimate reality . first published in 1937 , with numerous printings since then , this book is as fresh and new as a perfect spring morning . chapters include the sage , the world , god , the quest , the egoless state , and much more . for the modern day nondualist seeker , this is a treasure chest of spiritual wisdom . the author declares that we all , consciously or unconsciously , are always looking for the supreme beatitude of the egoless state , i.e. , direct knowledge of the one , the self . to quote a bit from the book : & quot ; the right thing to do is not to go on framing questions and seeking answers ... but to arrest the culprit , the ego , put him in the dock , and dispose of him by the quest of the real self , which he pretends to be . in other words , one should discover the real self , who is the final answer to all questions . every question that arises is vitiated by the ignorance which takes the ego at its face value , as the real self . all questions are therefore reducible to one , 'who am i ? ' . this question is the quest of the self , by which the egoless state is won. & quot ; for the person who 's ears are ready to hear , this book is sweet music indeed ! !
