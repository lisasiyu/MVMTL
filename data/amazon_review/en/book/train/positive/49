does strategic thinking impact innovation ? the way you think in the lab and the office really can directly impact innovation . even though this book was written about business , i have learned how to reapply its lessons to innovation - specifically kenichi helps to define and measure success and define the `` deliverables '' or `` outputs '' that innovation has to produce in order to become a reality . kenichi has a clear description of the biggest factors ( the 3 c 's ) impacting your success in business - the company , the competition , and the customer/consumer . if you look at innovation in this context , kenichi is actually also helping us innovators define `` what success looks like '' : the product/technology the company makes , how technically different or better it is than competitive benchmarks or alternatives in the marketplace , and whether conusmers like it and want it . on the projects i have worked on , advised others on , or simply observed the ones that make consistently hit at least all 3 of these deliverables and often additional deliverables to . those that fall short of all 3 consistently fail . hope this helps scientists , managers , entrepreneurs , and anyone with a creative or problem solving mind . dr. ali alwattari innovation author and practitione
