beautiful and brilliant this collection of essays masterfully ( or mistressfully ? ) weaves together autobiography , thealogy , feminist theory , and first-rate religious scholarship into an intoxicating blend that is at once moving and informative . christ raises many critical points that anyone doing contemporary theology ( particularly jewish or christian ) should seriously take under consideration . i am an american male graduate student in philosophy of religion who is pretty familiar with writings in feminist theology/thealogy , and i must say that christ 's prose ( in this book as well as her other work -- '' rebirth of the goddess '' is my personal favorite ) is some of the most lyrical and provocative stuff i have ever had the pleasure of reading . this type of religious writing is just the breath of fresh air the often stagnant academy needs . taste and see for yourself
