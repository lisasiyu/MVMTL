is this book worth your time and effort ? yes it is ! as i sit here thinking about the experience of reading the book , and it is an experience i assure you , i can tell you that there are slow periods in this `` story '' when you hope it will be `` over soon '' . so , do n't expect an `` easy read '' on this one . but the main idea is so `` universal '' and the story in its totality is so well written , that you forgive any `` lapses into boredom '' of the narrative . in fact , that 's partially what the book is about : `` small town boredom '' of an intelligent and thoughtful and self examining lady in the early part of the 20th century . and , further , it 's about the `` will to overcome '' and the `` courage to overcome '' this boredom and pettiness of the small town by the main character who is a `` downtrodden female '' of that era . i think this could be considered a `` woman 's lib '' book . as you read you will `` cheer on '' the main character , carol , as she faces down the town pettitness and town bullies and even her somewhat staid but basically `` good guy '' husband . the main thing that is bugging carol is this : she `` has n't found her true life 's occupation '' and she feels `` trapped '' in the little podunk town of gopher prairie and in her marriage so that she 'll never `` find her true self '' . ( wow , what a name for a town ! o ) this theme is a universal theme because everyone , even men , have the same driving force of finding `` who am i '' and `` where do i really belong . '' it 's a `` universal theme '' . thus this is an `` important book '' to read if you have ever had similer thoughts and restiveness about `` where do i belong '' and `` what is my true purpose in life . '' just keep reading past the `` slow parts '' and you 'll find that your effort will be rewarded . email boland7214 @ aol.c
