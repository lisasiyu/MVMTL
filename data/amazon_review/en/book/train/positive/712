life changing some of this is just common sense . but some of this was life changing for my family . the chapters in this book build upon themselves and as they grow they develop the theme of families being worth the effort . there are stories of real life situations , quotes , examples and more . one chapter is about making a plan and making a statement . and while i know this is based on a business type mode , we tried it . we made a family statement and it has been a large part of our lives . my children will recite it and use it as a reminder of what we expect of them . it is a great book . one that will have a place on my bookshelves for many years to come .
