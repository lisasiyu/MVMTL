i ca n't believe some of yall ... .. genevieve ( jenny-v ) is a damn good read , and i ca n't believe some of you all are rating it 2 to 3 stars . everyone has an opinion , so that 's why i beg to differ . this book kept me on the edge with its home-town drama . i would occasionally rub the old lady 's leg when i got to those good parts . i became so wrapped up into this dialogue , i could hear the voices , smell the cigarettes , touch ... well , that was the old lady . i loved it . mr. dickey is a great writer and i plan to buy every book that he writes in the future . unless he starts to get flakey and starts writing about aliens . that 's my two cents
