a master storyteller - a masterful rendering chris abani ranks right up there with chinua achebe and wole soyinka in my book . he peels away the glossy shell of life and dives right into the soft underbelly where life and death compete side by side . graceland took my breath away with its vivid rendering of lagos and nigeria , it 's compassionate protagonist , and its heartfelt stuggle to do more than merely survive . abani writes with such passion and insight that i was easily swept away with every sentence . i used to work in nigeria , and it all came rushing back to me with this book - the sights , the sounds , the smells , the pace . . . it 's all there . raucous music mingling with car horns . burning tires overpowering the barbeque chicken . palm wine and beer . overfilled jitneys . waterlogged slums . bar beach market . i have read this book twice already and am still not tired of it . in addition , i 've read his poetry in `` daphne 's lot '' and `` kalakuta republic '' and found them to be as melodic and memorable as `` graceland . '' i definitely recommend that you buy and read this book . it will earn a place in your heart and your top ten fiction list .
