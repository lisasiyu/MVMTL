self-loathing , self-doubt , how can a child love herself ? this was the first book i 've read by toni morrison , and it did not disappoint . the story takes place in ohio in the early 1940s - before the civil rights era , before martin luther king , jr. , and before rosa parks ever stayed seated on the bus . the story is told mainly from the focus from a young black girl about another young black in the neighborhood . the other black girl , pecola breedlove , comes from a family that is poor with a father who is an alcoholic . pecola is considered ugly and her greatest wish is to have blue eyes , as she firmly believes this will make her beautiful . naturally , the story involves much more than this , and toni morrison weaves a story that catches the reader up from the very first words and does n't release them until the final page is turned . ultimately , the idea of self-loathing is plainly seen - not just within pecola , but within an entire community , an entire race . pecola 's story is not a pleasant read , yet it is difficult not feel a tenderness for this child . she begs to be nurtured . many people who saw me reading this book told me it was a `` black '' book , but i disagree . the idea of self-loathing - either within oneself or within a community - is not specific to any one group of people , to my way of thinking . however , toni morrison has so captured the feelings and forced the reader to face them , that this book speaks to any and all who opens the pages . no child should be made to feel they are less simply because of who they are . a very moving book , highly recommended .
