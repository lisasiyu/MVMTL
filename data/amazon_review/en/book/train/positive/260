this book will never see the bookself ! this book is so great it will never see the bookshelf . as a first time mom , with my mom across the us , this book came in handy a lot . i started to read this before my baby was born , and learned stuff i never even knew . afterwards it came handy as a refrence , especially when my baby got sick ( which was a lot ) . this book is great for any first time mom as a shower gift
