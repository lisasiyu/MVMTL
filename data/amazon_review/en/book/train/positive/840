an inspiring read a wonderful book to read any time , but especially when you are searching for answers to why you hurt and how you can help yourself and your family not hurt anymore . i love the idea that we have the power to heal ourselves ( some would say miraculously ) . we do not have to feel dependant upon the `` gods '' of medicine and pharmacies in order receive a false `` cure '' heal yourself ... for good ! read this book then make a way to go to one of his classes . it will change your life
