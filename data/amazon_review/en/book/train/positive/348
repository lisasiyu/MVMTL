highbrow , lowbrow , or just plain cool ? a pivotal look at the development of latin american popular music , novelist alejo carpentier 's historical tract was originally published in 1946 , and came out of raging , decades-long intellectual debates about the nature of cuban and latin american culture . this is the first english translation of this work and includes a lengthy introductory essay by the editor , explaining the author 's role in the cuban intelligensia ... & quot ; music in cuba & quot ; was an attempt to settle some of the controversies about the & quot ; legitimacy & quot ; of cuban music , and to resolve the apparent differences between tony , europhilic art music and the grittier rural style that came to dominate the island 's popular imagination . it 's an intellectual , somewhat egghead-y book , but rich in cultural depth ... the new foreward is also very valuable , giving proper context to carpentier and his work , and a sense of the academic and philosophical life of cubans abroad and at home in the early 20th century
