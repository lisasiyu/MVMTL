great writer , interesting read this was an extremely well-written and well-executed book from a technical standpoint . the writing was smooth and concise , with excellent flow , and the story unfolds in a way that seems almost effortless . wolff adopts a remarkably objective tone in examining his own life , a tone which avoids making a melodrama out of his unfortunate childhood , while also creating a certain honesty that ( eventually ) makes you feel sympathy for a teenager who is not always easy to like . a side-effect of this detached viewpoint , however , is that at first i felt somewhat removed from what was happening . but i slowly warmed up to the young wolff , and by the end i came to cheer for him . i also recognized many of the feelings he had while growing up , feelings that are hard to admit to and even harder to put into words . wolff did a great job of exploring these feelings in an honest , tasteful way that was somehow both subtle and clear . overall i would recommend the book highly , and i plan on reading more from this author
