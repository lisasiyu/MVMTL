worth reading what can one say about this book that has n't been said before ? `` speaker for the dead '' is fundamentally different from `` ender 's game . '' those expecting epic space battles and wild technology will instead be confronted with science fiction in which the primary science is anthropology , which is a welcome change of pace . `` speaker for the dead '' is by turns gripping , moving , frustrating , interesting , preachy and grossly manipulative . it 's not perfect , but what is ? wise readers will stop the ender series at the end of `` speaker for the dead '' and pretend that `` xenocide '' does n't exist . do n't say i did n't warn you
