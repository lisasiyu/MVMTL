a charming children 's book i loved richard peck 's 'a year down yonder ' it was sweet , funny , cute , and well written . i have been made a deffinite richard peck fan from reading this book , it 's the first one of his books i 've read . 'a year down yonder ' is about mary alice dowdel , who has to leave her chicago home to go live with her grandma in louisiana , when her father loses his job . mary alice is at first skeptical about living in this small town with grandma dowdel , but soon she realizes that grandma is more than she appears ... ... and after that you 'll just have to read the book . you do n't have to read 'a long way from chicago ' the preceding book to 'a year down yonder ' to understand it . so , please enjoy 'a year down yonder ' by richard peck
