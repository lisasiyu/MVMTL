excellent book this book is full of excellent advice . i have been concerned about the products that i use for cleaning for a while and this book gave me a great one-stop resource to start doing something about it . the introduction on how to handle the mountain of stuff we tend to accumulate was a welcome bonus ( buying a copy for my ex-wife just for that ! )
