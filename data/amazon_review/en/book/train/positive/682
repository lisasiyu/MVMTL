sleeping with fear ! ! i have to say i agree with most of the other reviews.. kay hooper is one of a verrrry few authors i buy in hardback.. i was dissapionted in the book.. where were the agents with their psychic abilities.. it was hard to follow where riley was going . the ending seems a bit thrown together.. i mean her and ash were talking one min and the next she was off in a hummer..i like what she tried to do with the book but i think she fell short.. it seems to me kay hooper was not able to write the amnesia well into the story at all.. i sure hope the next book is better i think i will wait for it in paperback
