excellent catuionary tale ; funny and lively not too many children 's authors could get away with a story in which a bad little boy is eaten up by a lion , but sendak handles this potentially unsettling story line with a master 's touch . children will love the repetition of `` i do n't care , '' which seems to be pierre 's response to everything , and the varied rhyme scheme keeps the text from becoming a monotonous set of couplets . after his exasperated parents leave him home alone ( the picture of them walking away from pierre 's perspective might actually be more of a threat to the listener than being eaten ) , a lion shows up at his house . the foolhardy pierre is not impressed in the slightest , and wo n't be cowed from his trademark line when the lion asks him if he would like to be eaten . after pierre 's parents return home , they figure out what happened , assault the lion , and take him to the hospital , where a chastened pierre is extracted uninjured . sendak is one of those authors whose work continues to shine more brightly than the hundreds of derivative picture books out there . like shel silverstein and roald dahl , there is a hint of wickedness to his work , but it 's all in good fun . this is a classic , pure and simple ; a complete sendak collection is a good idea for any child !
