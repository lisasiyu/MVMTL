could be worse , but could be more thought-provoking i agree that the included articles could be better . they are dry & amp ; i find that they do n't encourage a lot of discussion without prompting . they seem like & quot ; safe & quot ; choices designed not for thought but sheer modelling . what i do really like is the prewriting activities included at the end of each chapter . my students always appreciate all of the writing they have done by the time the draft is due , though i have added to the exercises to make the more in-depth and individualized . not the ideal comp 1 book , but certainly not the worst i 've used
