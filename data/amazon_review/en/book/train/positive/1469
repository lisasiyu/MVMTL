how to write : annie 's way ! in this book annie talks about what she does to write . each author has their own idiosyncratic and philosophical ways and means about how they write . annie shares with us some of both of her own . she prefers a place without distraction . a room with `no view ' is preferable . she does not even have too many basic heating or air conditioning requirements . she will get by . she finds a room over a garage or a pine shed without out any windows just perfect . no distractions . philosophically she talks about the value of the reader knowing the lengths to which the author goes to create what they do . she questions the relevance of that information . and throughout , she discusses the position the author has ; the removed and yet constrained perspective that the writer possesses in creating the work they are writing . finally , she talks about the author having the power to discuss extremes . conceptually , the idea of `` absolutes '' being the focus of all non-fiction writing is mentioned . the author 's ability to set the tone , the mood and the results are discussed , but with the caveat that the story sometimes leads the author , and not the other way around .
