thomas groome transformed my vision to religious education . i 've already read this book 13 years before . at that time i was a seminarian and very interested in the catechesis . when i finished this book , i had to change my focus from the boring knowledge to the wondering life . he presented 5 steps from the abundant sources of philosophical , psychological , educational , and religious theories . now i have been ordained to being a priest . i am re-reading this book . there are lots of needs to be changed in my attitude for education as before . this book is a kind of mirror for correcting my makeup . life is always more important than any others . our story and vision of life should be effected by jesus story and vision of life . thomas gives us an appropriate method . on the other hand , i think this book should be revised for practical needs . frankly , it 's really hard yet to get understanding
