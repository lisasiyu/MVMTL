simple so not only is this a great play by shakespeare but it 's also an easy version to read right along side the original text . no need to get out the old dictionary for those words that you stumble across trying to guess the actual meaning of because it 's right there next to you . this does n't take away from the play at all either . speaking of the play , this is a wonderful romance that reminds us how naive people can be if they are n't exposed to all of the harsh realities of life . the lady in this play practically falls in love with the first man she lays eyes on that she has n't grown up with ! it may have something to do with the magic that her father possesses . better yet , it has everything to do with her father and the spirits that are under his spell . after you 're done with the book , try to find a live performance of this play
