fascinating read on the changing of victorian society ! i just finished this nice long read , and i must say it was very well written : trollope shows us a fascinating view of how the changes in society can affect the people living in it . we are given a view of all sorts of characters : from the volatile , swindler melmotte to the swaggering , gambling coward felix carbury , to his antithesis , his staid , country cousin roger carbury , and felix 's silly & conniving mother lady carbury , to his sweet & saintly sister hetta carbury ... the mousey marie melmotte , the marriage schemer georgiana longestaffe , the wonderful yet fallible paul montague , and the independent & brash american , mrs. hurtle . these & many other characters collide to give us a fascinating read , as their lives intertwine again & again , on so many levels . the staid & proper upper-crust victorian society of yesteryear is slowly melting away , as english virtue & honor is being overtaken by lying , cheating , swindling , stealing , and much more . where being a proper , honorable gentleman used to bring its own reward , now it is the more `` modern '' social rules that are taking effect in london society . will virtue or vice triumph in the end ? an excellent read , highly recommended !
