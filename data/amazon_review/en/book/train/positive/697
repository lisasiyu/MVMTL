a great , exciting book , it put me in touch with what my dad must have gone through i wish my dad was still alive to see this book , and that i could talk to him about it . he ( robert h. hofer ) was a machinist 's mate on the santa fe for most of its career , and i remember hearing him describe the saving of the franklin , and seeing steel burn as the franklin 's magazines exploded and showered the deck of the santa fe with fire ; and also what it was like to work down in the engine room while the ship manuvered off the beach at iwo jima , exposed to shore fire . the descriptions in this book are incredibly vivid and exciting , and answer a lot of the questions i wish i could ask my dad today . forgive any errors of fact -- maybe the author has read all the reviews and will put out a revised version in the future . if you 've ever wondered what it must have been like to be 19 years old , in the middle of the pacific , fighting the japanese in the biggest naval battles in history , then you 've got to read this book
