entertaining and informative look at crossword construction in an age when the advent of computer-generated sudoku seem to be taking over , matt gaffney responds with this very eloquent and entertaining exploration of standard crosswords and how they are created . gaffney , an experienced puzzle constructor and editor , offers glimpses into the history of crosswords and their attributes , but the real strength of his book is its insight into the effort that constructors go in making gems for puzzlers . he discusses the way that puzzle themes have evolved over time , the limits of themed and non-themed puzzles , challenges that constructors have posed themselves , and how new-wave constructors have pushed the boundaries of puzzles using technology to help them fill grids and using their twisted brains to find ever-more-intriguing clues . this book is well written in a conversational style filled with humorous anecdotes and includes interviews with many editors and constructors . of most interest to me was a chapter in which four constructors are given partially completed grids and are asked to use their brains or computer assistance to generate `` fills '' that they think are best . the results are beautifully divergent , and the way that judges viewed them and rated them points out that the nature of `` beauty '' in crosswords is still a contested area . like amende 's `` crossword obsession '' and romano 's `` crossworld '' this book focuses on a very small field , but the thoroughness and humor that suffuse it make it a strong addition . this book will offer you insights into puzzles if you are a novice and will generate laughs of recognition and empathy if you are an expert or constructor . i recommend it . will j
