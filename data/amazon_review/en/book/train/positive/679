lifts the veil to see inside england 's upper class lives i thought this book would be brit chick-lit with some aristocracy thrown in , but was in for a surprise . it 's an analysis of the british upper class and the aspirations of the middle class through the story of edity lavery who catches herself an earl . the adjustments she must make trying to fit in makes an interesting story . actually each scene gets analyzed from different angles , but for an american reader the rehashing of tone of voice and raised eyebrow is probably necessary . much of the story would have passed me by without the explanations that accompany it through the voice of a well-born actor , the earl 's mother , edith herself , and a host of other characters . things get messy when edith finds life in a stately home a crashing bore . intrigued by a handsome actor , she contemplates chucking the prestigious marriage that she worked so hard to achieve .
