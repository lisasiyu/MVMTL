excellent story for my 3-year old i thought this was a wonderful story with exquisite illustrations . my 3-year old was enthralled with it , and checks it out from the library whenever she can . it 's a good story about responsibility and treating animals with understanding , as well as getting ready for santa 's sleigh ride
