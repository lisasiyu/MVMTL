the great war in retrospect there are many reasons why world war i has been labeled the great war : it was the war to end all wars in the minds of those who lived through it , who were directly and indirectly affected by it , who continue to reference it as the war with the most emotional cost . in times when wars seems to constantly queue since that inception of world war , wars spreading from ww ii , through korea , vietnam , the gulf , balkans , eastern europe , spain , africa , iraq , afghanistan , south america and on , taking a long hard look at the great war will hopefully center our attention on a past time that can be analyzed and from which we can hopefully learn . now that jay winters ' brilliant book 'sites of memory , sites of mourning : the great war in european cultural history ' is available/affordable in paperback , every household should have a copy as children grow into the years of this century . winters ' examination of the devastation of ww i and the ways in which it informed all of the arts , the architecture , the literature , films , memorials - the people of the globe - is a mighty assignment and he is more than successful in humanizing his message . this book overflows with photographs of places , faces , bodies alive and dead , paintings , sculptures , film stills - each of which drives home winters ' powerful message . sad though it may be to admit , war is a part of life on this abused planet : the more we study it the more we hopefully will reduce it . winters wants to make sure that we remember , that we read , view , walk through , see , hear , and listen to the remnants the great war left behind . this is a powerful , necessary book and should be required reading and viewing for us all . highly recommended . grady harp , august 0
