get to really know your cards first , i must say that the previous reviewer shuns the author 's decision to include other books as recommended reading , yet i find that when an author does this , they are helping the reader truly expand on the subject , and it shows that the author is secure enough to not feel that their way is the only way . this book has been the most helpful book for me to learn the tarot , and about myself and friends/family . there 's a bit of numerology in it , and some lessons that are fun to do , at the same time , these teach more about the cards . i would recommend this book to novices and skilled alike
