great communicator who knew god i would say that this is one of my favorite books . tozer communicates in a way that makes you think . he knows how to make you get you thinking about your 'religious ' ways and pursue the living god . this man can communicate in a way that is not over your head , but yet takes you deep . if you have n't read this book and would like to have a more intimate relationship with him , this book is a very good place to start as it will direct you to the god of the word
