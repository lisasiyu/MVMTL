a masterpiece ! ! ! it broke my heart to see anyone compare this masterpiece to a disney film or a modern work of art . there is no comparison . i first read this book 17 years ago and was so captivated that i could not put it down . i often wonder why hollywood tried to reproduce this book at all , since not one single movie has ever come close to giving us a glimpse of all this book has to offer . the ties and the love and the betrayal , the architectual detail alone , all of it make for one of the most profound works of literature ever written . please do not be spoiled by the quick reads that one is most aquainted with today . take the time to reaquaint yourself with this extraordinary work that will leave you heartbroken and amazed by the end .
