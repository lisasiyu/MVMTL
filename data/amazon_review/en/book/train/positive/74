a critical analysis worthy of acclaim among the books in defense of globalization , this is among the best for the methodlogical care with which the author has presented his arguments . the text is lucid and very appropriate for students . perhaps the only deficiency is a reluctance to engage the question of institutional reform with the wto that could potentially compromise environmental and social protection . the failure of the doha round and the wssd in this regard is neglected . however , the author does an admirable job debunking a lot of myths that are so vitriolically presented by antiglobalization activists .
