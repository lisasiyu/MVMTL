a very good start for eliminating self sabotage i really like this book . as a professional motivational speaker , who is trained and experienced in many motivational disciplines , i find this book touches on some very key things that one needs to master in order to be a success . the part i found particularly relevant was the part on career acrophobia . this section really touches on why many people just do n't get ahead . it explains the glass ceiling and self sabotage phenomena very well . the only reason this book does n't get a 5 star rating , is that it 's a little weak on how to effectively address , the emotional issues it talks about . there are far more effective ways of addressing these issues , but this book does give you a good start . i 'd recommend it . in everything truth , faith and love destin
