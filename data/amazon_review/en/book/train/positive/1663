best drug handbook on the market ! i 've had every edition of this drug handbook for about 10 years now , and i use it often . i 've seen lots of `` other '' veterinary drug handbooks , but they pale in comparison to plumb 's . there 's just the right amount of information here -- not too much , not too little . other handbooks seem relatively lacking in content
