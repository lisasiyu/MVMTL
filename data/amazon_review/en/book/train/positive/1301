for aspiring `` bark '' itects as a lifelong cat lover , i normally would not have glanced at this book , but my nephew , now a jr. in high school , has chosen architecture as his career . that , plus his love of dogs , caused me to have a look at the contents of this book as a possible fun gift for him . glad i did ! the imagination , the styling , the artistry , and of course , the love that obviously went into the creation of this book , proved to be a great gift choice for my nephew . even if there area no canines sharing your life , this would be a great coffee-table book to keep on display for friends and guests to enjoy
