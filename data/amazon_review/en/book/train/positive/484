laugh at yourself - then understand ! this book was recommended to us by a psychotherapist when we came to discuss family problems . it was a great help through the first few weeks of therapy - and progress followed rapidly . psychoanalysis never had such a coherent explanation ! and the voice of john cleese makes a great delivery for the info . bravo
