living large with an opionated dog if i had used the `` make the dog obey '' theories and techniques on my opinionated male great dane , he would n't be here today . he is too big for me to `` make '' him do anything . he is also a sensitive beast and needs encouragement not punishment . i had to find ways that did 2 things : make it easier for him to do what i asked and offer him the rewards that he values . pat miller 's book showed me how to do that . pat 's book gives the theory and the practical steps to apply to your dog . one book can not cover all possible situations but as the basic primer for most dogs and their humans , this one does the job . this book is the one at the top of my list . it 's for people new to dogs and to those who want a way to train themselves and their dog into a more comfortable and complementary relationship
