great story , what 's with the ending ? i love this story , i was loving it from page one up until the last comic . i mean here we have a great subtly running plot in thorpe , silver , and the deceased doctor , but then suddenly in the last issue we see none of the three stories resolved . yes , we are implied strongly that the doctor does away with thorpe , but that isnt good enough , what of thorpe 's empire , how does batman find out , and do we ever see the ghost again , maybe we do n't , maybe we 're better for it . but as for silver , at least i was sad to see her walk away as yet another superhero-girlfriend-itis casualty and not have anything more happen along the lines of her life in general , or batman 's general dealing with it . anyways , at least these were just issues and not an intended mini-series , so all of these qualms are pretty much null and void . as a whole , its an awesome story
