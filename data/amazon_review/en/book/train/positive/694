good start i 've used some version of this book for many years now , and i 've seen it evolve . i think , as other reviewers have said , that there are some simplified portions of the book , especially those parts dealing with monetary economics . there are other portions which lay out the principles as only these authors can , and those parts are extremely helpful and valuable . this book allows me to teach my notes and thoughts with a textbook serving as a reference and an introduction -- it does n't get in my way , in other words . i use it along with several other texts , and i think it gets the job done . students seem to like it as well , mainly for its clarity . for someone wanting to learn the basics , this is an excellent choice
