very enjoyable ! at first when i tried to read it i thought the language was a little too descriptive but i realized that it was crucial to the mindset of this time period . in 1870 's new york society , detail was everything from what food you served at gatherings to the type of carriage you rode in . everything one did or possessed made a statement about who they are and what they stood for . you get this point clearly in the beginning when the characters are introduced . the main character newland archer comes from a respectable family so it would make sense that he would marry may welland who comes from the respectable mingott family . but things do n't run smoothly when may 's cousin countess ellen olenska returns to america after leaving her european husband . rumors ensue among members of society forcing newland to take sides with ellen because of may . but soon newland sees in ellen a free spiritedness that he does n't see in may . soon he finds himself trapped in a triangle . the whole plot kept me fascinated because just when you think something is going to happen an interesting development occurs . just remember everything is n't what it seems in the book . on the surface a party is given for a member of the family , but underneath are harsh judgments and diversions of person 's intentions . by the ending i was surprised but then again not surprised . i can see why this book is still acclaimed after all these decades
