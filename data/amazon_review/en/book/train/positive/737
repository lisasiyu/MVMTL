interesting book on understudied topic de becker 's book is an interesting introduction to a topic that we rarely give critical thought to , namely our survival instincts , fear , and ways of coping with dangerous situations that most americans are likely to face . the dangers that de becker talks about are more likely to affect women and celebrities ( i.e . stalking , rape ) , but he also talks about robberies , teen suicides/murders , intra-family crimes of violence , etc . he repeatedly talks about how predictable crimes are based on people 's past behavior , as well as the simple measures we can use to determine whether or not strangers likely mean us harm or have intentions other than those stated by them . my main critique of the book is that it sometimes came off like a big advertisement for his firm , which specializes in security services and consulting rather than as a guide for everyone . nevertheless i recommend the book , especially for younger and middle aged women .
