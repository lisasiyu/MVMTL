excellent biography this is a spectacular read , well balanced in all aspects of jfk 's life from cradle to grave . although rather long , the pages flow nicely . the author takes the middle road , and sees jfk as a great leader in many situations , but not perfect nor a saint . this produces a well-rounded and complete biography . new information on jfk 's health is sprinkled throughout . as a caveat , this book is about jfk 's life , not his death . less than ten pages of over 700 are involving the assassination . so regardless of what you think or feel about november of 1963 , if you want a book focused on that , find a different book instead of leaving negative reviews
