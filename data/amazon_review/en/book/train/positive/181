two cold cold worlds this is one of my least favorite bellow novels . but because it is bellow it has a lot worth reading in it . his thoughts about society and culture may not always be exactly on the mark , but they usually stimulate and inspire . in this novel the hero is a bit less sympathetic than many of his other main characters . henderson , herzog , humboldt , sammler , augie march have vivacity and life that dean corde does not . the dean 's wife too falls short of bellow 's livelier and more appealing feminine creations , for instance the ramona and madelaine of herzog . so too the whole spirit of the work has about it a pessimism and bleakness which contrast strongly with that of augie march , and henderson , and even in its way , herzog . this book is really a winter book , and it has coldness and dying in it . and it has the oppression of the communist iron curtain world in romania , and the depression of chicago 's most beaten and desperate streets . the characters and the story seem less alive than the ideas . again this is not one of his best . far from it . but it is bellow and because of that a worthwhile read .
