riveting excursion into small town relationships . salem 's lot has become a yearly staple for me . when the days begin to grow short , and the air gets a little thick and crisp , i like to pull this book out , and go for a lie in the hammock . it has been a fall favorite , since my freshman year of college . though not entirely wholesome , this book is one of the most puritan of stephen king 's prolific library . there are really no graphic sexual scenes , and the language is tame , in comparison to . . . say , the stand . but you do n't care about that . you want to know why i thought it was a heck of a good read . king is fascinated by small towns . i can say that with a good deal of authority , because two-thirds of what he writes about takes place in small , maine towns . it 's not the four-way intersections , and the cowpoke attitude that seems to capture his interest , but the dynamics of the small town , itself . there is a certain attitude , in a small town ; kind of like high school cliques , but on a grander scheme . a small town has its own atmosphere ; its own incestuous existence . stephen king enjoys watching as relationships frazzle , and small towns are demolished , with the ghoulish glee of a small child knocking over sandcastles . 'salem 's lot mixes stark dread with a rockwellian nostalgia that oozes out of the pages . the result is a horrifically delicious milkshake that covers some traditional vampire ground , but also manages to stay fresh and poignant . if the cemetery scene ( in which a father grieves for his dead son ) does n't give you goosebumps , you are truly a jaded individual .
