thousand pieces of gold the film ( one of my favorites ) inspired me to acquire the book and as usual i found the book to be far superior to the film . the norm since converting a book to film is similiar to condensing . the book did lack in factual detail which would have made it longer and far more interesting , as a factual historical novel . as a piece on racial discrimination and women 's fight for equality it is the best of reading . for those interested in the subject the book and film are well worth adding to your collection .
