amazing this is an incredible piece of work ! it is one of the top 5 best and most impacting books that i 've ever read ( and i 've read a lot ) . there are so many thoughts and principles that have stuck with me . this is n't a book you read where you come away wondering what you learned because you ca n't articulate what you read and/or learned . with this book , there are amazing teachings . it is much better than so many other books on business , leadership , and life balance . as an family man , mba and non-profit student director , his book and my application of its principles have truly left a great impact on my life and in turn the lives of others
