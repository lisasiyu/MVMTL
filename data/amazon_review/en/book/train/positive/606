joel gives fuel to the empty soul i read this book within 4 hours on a flight . it really changed my perspective on life and how to put a painful past behind me . i have bought at least 10 books for my friends whom are going through some very trying times . i ca n't speak for them but i know it 's altered their lives and thinking . it 's an easy read book you wo n't want to put down
