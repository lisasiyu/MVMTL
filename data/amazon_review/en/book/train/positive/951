interesting this book by susan mackey-kallis provides an interesting approach to classic movies like star wars , the natural , lion king , 2001 , etc . using a mythological perspective . the ideas of joseph campbell and carl jung are illustrated using examples from these films . i found the book to be very informative . a good read if you are at all interested in film or mythology . another good book to check out by the same author is `` oliver stone 's america , '' which takes a similar approach to stone 's films .
