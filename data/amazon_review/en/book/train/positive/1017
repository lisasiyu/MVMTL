what russian literaute ought to be in a letter to the fourth congress of soviet writers solzhenitsyn writes , `` lierature that is not the breath of contemporary society , that dares not transmit the pains and fears of that society , that does not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers - such literature does not deserve the name of literature ; it is only a façade . '' cancer ward is no façade . a truly moving story of life and death , disease and recovery , cancer ward is a novel with impact . the characters are brilliantly portrayed and it is they who tell the story . from loyal party member pavel nikolayevich to labor camp survivor oleg kostoglotov and through all the characters whose lives fit somewhere in between , the virtues and faults of socialism are examined , dissected , and layed out clearly for the reader . while his contemporaries were busy writing safe novels , novels which towed the party line and supported the prescribed views of stalinism , solzhenitsyn took a grave risk . he wrote novels which reflected truth . he wrote novels which portrayed the real life trials of the people . and , in the end , he wrote novels which were not published in the nation he so dearly loved . make no mistake . alexander solzhenitsyn was no rebel . he truly loved his country and supported his government . his use of brutally honest literature was meant to strengthen his beloved country . it was solzhenitsyn 's hope that by portraying the weaknesses of his country he might help eliminate some of those problems . alas , his works were largely ignored due to the unrelenting censorship of the soviet government . fortunately for the rest of the world his works were not lost . they found their way out of russia and onto the stage of world literature . for this we can all be thankful . cancer ward is an enriching novel and a worthy addition to anyone 's library . this is not a book you want to pass up
