great book seriously , i had to write this review because of all the people who gave it such a low rating . are you kidding me . ok there may be a few things wrong with the book . i would n't mind a few pictures here and there . however , to say that the whole book is terrible is a bit extreme . i have a bunch of cookbooks and this is the one i continually go back to to compare recipes . i sold baked good at a farmers market and his oatmeal chocolate chip cookies got rave reviews . he also gives so many options on a way to change a recipe . like his cheescake . he gives you a way to light it up or make a dense one . he troublshoots each recipe in case something did go wrong . very good book
