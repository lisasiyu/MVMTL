outstanding , a comprehensive and valuable text ! fumon tanaka sensei 's mastery of kobudo , iaijutsu , and jujitsu is well articulated in this excellent work . the writing is much clearer than many asian master 's first works in english . the layout is extraordinarily well done with outstanding photos and illustrations that really augment the text . content includes budo ( martial arts ) history , jujutsu , kenjutsu , and samurai tradition . the nito-ken ( two-sword ) techniques included herein are not widely taught and rarely described in other texts . basic , intermediate , and advanced honmon enshin ryu applications are well laid out , with many okuden ( secret ) mastry level techniques portrayed . the focus is primarily on sword to sword applications though there is also a small section on sword vs. yari ( spear ) , naginata ( halberd ) , bo ( staff ) , and shuriken ( throwing star ) as well . there is also a bit of muto dori ( no sword ) techniques covered as well . the author really knows his stuff and communicates it effectively . tanaka sensei has been studying martial arts since 1956 , achieving an 8th dan black belt in kobudo , 7th dan in jujutsu and kyoshi iai suemonogiri kenpo , 5th dan in bojutsu , and 4th dan in kendo among other accomplishments . while you can not learn any martial art solely from a book , this work is an excellent place to learn about these systems or augment your dojo training . highly recommended ! lawrence kane author of surviving armed assaults , the way of kata , and martial arts instructio
