my favorite book ! i just got this book and i have already become obsessed with dreams of building my own rolling home this summer . the photographs are all very beautiful , and the book is also full of great drawings and diagrams . not much text , but what 's there is very well written . this book has inspired me to live my life in a whole new , fun way . this is definately worth buying
