great action i just finished this book ( for the second time , actually ) and enjoyed it just as much as reilly 's other books . the hero of the story , william race , is what many of us would like to be : a regular guy who , when thrust into extraordinary situations , very capably becomes the hero . of course the action is over the top and unrealistic . it 's supposed to be ! i tell everybody who asks that reilly is the best action writer i 've ever read . i 'm not sure why some people blast his books so bad . do a little research and know what you 're getting into . if you like high-powered , non-stop action , this is the guy for you . if you 're not , then here 's a clue : do n't read reilly 's books ! ! ! sounds pretty simple
