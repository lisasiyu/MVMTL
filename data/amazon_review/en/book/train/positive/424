terrific , insightful book i think some of the negative impressions of this book stem from the fact that people were expecting something different from `` joe bob briggs . '' well , the truth is that before he was joe bob 's , real name is john bloom and he was ( and is ) a fantastic award winning investigative journalist . his serious side really shines here . he has written a very accessible , erudite and enjoyable book of criticism here , and his critiques of these challenging films still resides within a moral frame work . he strikes a balance here that i think few critics could pull off given the subject matter . but mainly it 's just a great read , even for those that are n't necessarily film buffs . the generous and well-done layout is also worth commending . i highly recommend .
