short , simple & sweet yet power packed with life changing principles i had heard of this book through someone else and wanted to read it because of the self-help quiz at the book 's website . however , when i got the chance to read it , i finished it almost in one sitting . like one of the other reviewers said , it reminds you of the basics and how the act of being nice to someone no matter what their station is in life can ultimately change your life . what i like is that the book does n't teach you to fake being nice ; it challenges you to actually be genuinely nice to others , often with no thought of gaining something in return . a simple principle but as its many examples illustrate , a powerful one that can impact your life in ways you 'd never expect .
