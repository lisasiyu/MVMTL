geared more towards parents than teens my son saw my copy of `` yes , your teen is crazy '' ( which was an excellent book by the same author . ) i thought this book would be geared more towards teens -- as i planned on giving it to my son to read -- to understand why parents act the way they do . however , it was not written for a teenager . it was very similar to the `` ... teen is crazy '' book .
