laurie colwin 's best ... i 've read it half a dozen times i am a huge fan of laurie colwin 's writing , so i am baffled by the reviewers who did n't enjoy this book as much as i did . to me , her writing is sophisticated yet very comfortable . i can identify most with the main character in this particular book of hers as i also married a bit later in life and am trying to have a child despite being a little long in the tooth . the longings jane louise has for the domestic bliss that other people in her life seem to have so easily are all too familiar . this book will not hit you over the head with a message , and it does meander ... which is just like life for most of us . and i for one sometimes enjoy a book that does n't leave me with a headache . reading is so much like eating - balancing what 's good for you with satisfying cravings for those things that are n't - and for me , laurie colwin 's books are like hot tea with milk and sugar on a cold afternoon . grown up , but sweet and comforting - they always hit the spot . and i still find myself in disbelief that there will be no more books by this great writer
