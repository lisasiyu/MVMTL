u2 fans ... . a required book ! ! as a u2 fan since the beginning , this is a book i will cherish . although the `` i '' is friend/photographer , anton corbijn ... . you will feel like it 's your own photo album . taking you via pictures ( and corbijns personal notes ) , through the years of u2 the baby boy , to u2 all grown and on their own ... and in a league of their own . as many times as people have said `` a must have '' , i truly have to tell u2 fans to buy this book ! ! ! even if you only love it half as much as i do ; - )
