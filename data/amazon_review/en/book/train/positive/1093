jewish tenements this is really an artful piece of work . eisner was a revolutionary . he paved the way for stories that were embedded in reality . he really inspired another legend , frank miller who produced daredevil 's best run and sin city . these are some really gripping stories that grasped at my heart strings i felt sorry for the wife of the alley singer , i felt sorry for the rabbi who lost his daughter , etc . well it seems i just felt sorry for these folks . if you 're a comic fan , you love reality represented and you like tan and white ( which eisner said is the color people dream in ) then this is the book for you
