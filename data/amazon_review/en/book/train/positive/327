america 's educator is amy goodman the last honest journalist in america ? along with maybe 20 others - maybe yeah ! ! ! what i admire most about ms goodman is her persistence - while there are other hard-working investigative journalists - seymour hersh , robert fisk , to name a few - no one - but no one - punches in as many hours on the clock as she does . all of which is evidenced in the book which is a summation of the highlights of her research leading up to the build-up of the war in iraq and through the war as it stands now . what is essential in this rendering , however , is that the reasons for our current policy are made explicit - as they are daily on her magnificent show on radio free america - pacifica . it 's nice to see it collected in an easily referenced and indexed hard copy
