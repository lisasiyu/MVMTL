different than rise to rebellion , but still very , very good . 'the glorious cause ' is the second in shaara 's two volume piece historical fiction concerning the revolutionary war . 'rise to rebellion ' was the first , and i believe the superior of the two , but 'the glorious cause ' is an excellent novel as well . 'rise to rebellion ' was the superior of the two novels due to the changes of heart that the readers sees in john adams and benjamin franklin concerning the issue of independence from england . 'the glorious cause ' has little of that type deep soul-searching . however , it is a fantastic portrayal of the difficulties encountered by the continental army and george washington , in particular . if i were to have my druthers , i would have preferred that shaara had broken this 600+ page novel into two novels and expanded them both by delving more into the politics of the day and the difficulties of fighting a war with the governmental structures and restrictions that the contintenal congress was hampered with . in addition , more battles and fronts could have been explored , such as the ill-fated american invasion of canada and benedict arnold 's naval adventures on lake champlain . that being said , these are still a highly recommended novels - either for the american revolution novice or the enthusiast . well done , mr. shaara
