a nostalgic classic this is a beautiful book . it is reminiscent of the images and style of children 's books published at the time when disney originally released sleeping beauty . this is a real tribute and a cherished edition to have from one of disney 's best and often overlooked fairy tale classics . it has a real place in my heart
