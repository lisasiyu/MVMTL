the mystery of the zombie hunch as the concept of the modular structure of the brain emerged , objections to the idea took the form of `` well , if my brain 's made up of computers , somebody in there has to be in charge . it had better be me ! '' this comment , paraphrased from philosopher jerry fodor , typifies what daniel dennett has been contending with for many years . although the `` cartesian theatre '' notion , that the body was one aspect of our being and the mind another - `` dualism '' - has supposedly been supplanted , it has not lost its hold on our view of consciousness . we continue to insist , in some form or other , that `` somebody , and it better be me '' is inside our minds looking out at the world . although we ca n't find that `` self '' in there , we have a hunch it 's there . when dennett wrote `` consciousness explained '' in 1991 , it seemed the `` homunculus '' representing our `` self '' had been laid to rest . this excellent collection of essays and lectures , is an update on that earlier work . as lectures , they have a conversational tone , yet impart many deep insights . addressing consciousness through four major themes , dennett shows us the project of eradicating `` dualism '' remains incomplete . until that view of `` self '' is discarded , our understanding of consciousness will remain misleading . the first theme he addresses is the `` zombie '' . philosophers have posed the idea that a duplicate person , identical to you in every way but one , is logically possible . the person would act as you act , talk as you do , have the same preferences and distastes . but it would not be conscious . this proposal presumes that something in you could be identified that is lacking in the zombie . for most of us , who still feel our `` self '' remains somehow separate within us , the logic seems reasonable . dennett carefully examines the implications of the proposal , and dismisses it as modernised dualism . if a region of the brain holds the key to `` self '' it remains out of sight and undetectable . perhaps the most challenging segment of the book deals with `` heterophenomonology '' . this tongue-twisting phrase refers to the methods used in cognitive science . because consciousness is `` often celebrated as a mystery beyond science '' dennett challenges researchers to take a step back from commonly accepted techniques . become a `` martian '' cognitive scientist to broaden the scope of the work . one facet of this approach relies on understanding what `` folk psychology '' is , then building from there . we prefer to believe that what we believe is entirely private and unaccessible . heterophenomonolgy , he contends , will expose aspects of our consciousness we view as a `` mystery '' . one of those `` mysteries '' has been wrapped in the idea of `` qualia '' . probably one of the poorest concepts in philosophy , `` qualia '' are things said to possess `` intrinsic qualities '' . when you carefully examine those `` intrinsic '' properties , they begin to fade and vanish . if `` qualia '' is in an object we see , such as colour , how can it change without our noticing ? tests of `` change blindness '' indicate we can miss much concerning `` qualia '' . even the philosophic community , dennett notes , can not agree on a definition of `` qualia '' . yet , like the homunculus in the mind viewing the world , it steadfastly remains in use . the author examines this idea further in relating the story of `` mary '' , the colour-deprived scientist . in `` consciousness explained '' , dennett proposed the multiple drafts model of consciousness and cognition . in this collection , he enhances the original concept . with no centre in the brain , consciousness necessarily must be a distributed process . the progress of imaging and other technologies have expanded our view of the brain 's functions . dennett argues that the brain is `` fame '' not `` television '' . the process is one of competition for dominance , no matter how fleeting . the mind is not a `` top-down '' or `` bottom-up '' process , but a `` sideways '' one . ideas , experiences and other informational bits jostle for `` clout '' . it 's not easy to shed the idea of a special `` self '' in your mind , but all that 's going on in there is still you . as usual , dennett has challenged successfully the `` established '' views of consciousness . clearly , he argues , consciousness is neither an arcane `` mystery '' nor beyond serious and definitive investigation . the mind-set erecting barricades using the bricks of `` qualia '' and the mortar of the `` cartesian theatre '' can , and must be , overcome for serious investigation to proceed . delicacy and care must be employed , but the prize is understanding .
