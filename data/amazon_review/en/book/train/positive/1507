one of the great contemporary american novels this book is perhaps my favorite american novel of all time . kesey 's brand of storytelling is highly engaging and makes this book readable in one sitting . however , he is most admirable for his characters . the protaganist of `` one flew over the cuckoo 's nest '' is randle patrick mcmurphy , a brash and determined young delinquent with a devil-may-care attitude . mcmurphy feigns a mental disorder in order to be moved from prison to a mental ward . upon entering the mental institution , mcmurphy stirs up all kinds of trouble by befriending and influencing a bevy of mental patients , all with their own interesting eccentricities . all of this is done to the dismay of the dictatorial `` big nurse '' who becomes mcmurphy 's nemesis . interestingly , the story is told through the character chief broom who for years has pretended that he is a deaf mute , an aspect that affords him greater perceptability . i highly recommend this book -- it will humor , sadden , move , and excite anyone who reads it . i have also concluded that -- in my limited experience with literature -- randle patrick mcmurphy is the greatest character ever conceived by an american novelist
