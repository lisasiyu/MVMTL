a journey i do n't do a lot of reading for fun . but this book i could n't put down once i started it . it did n't take long for me to be drawn into the story and i could almost taste , see , and experience with the chracters . i vividly experienced this book . that does n't happen to me often . the quiet american is a powerful work . i recommend this book especially to those people who like me do n't read much fiction . i wrote a longer review on bn.com if you want to read a more detailed review that i wrote .
