interesting but not the greatest i remember reading this work years ago in connection with the study i was then making of american jewish literature . my impression was much that of another amazon reader . it is at times a vivid account of a new immigrant experience , but the tale is not told with the deepest intensity of feeling . it may be unfair but the comparison which comes to mind is with henry roth 's `` call it sleep '' which is a fictional work but one which goes deep into the soul and consciousness . this work is a more externally directed narrative , and has its virtue in giving a picture of one person 's move to the new world
