book=excellent , binding=poor love , love , love the book . reading his recipes has changed me from an `` adventurous cook '' to a truly great one . thanks mr. bittman . but about that binding ... my copy is now a 80 volume edition . i am sick of digging though all of the loose pages to find the recipes that i want . after i take the book from the shelf , there are always a number of pages that did n't travel with the cover . ugh . i have no idea how to fix this . i 'm here for another copy . *sheepish grin
