post-apocalyptic religion dick wrote this in collaboration with another sf great , roger zelazny , though the end result is not really one of either author 's best efforts . in a post-world-war-iii wasteland a religion has grown up around the god of wrath , whose human embodiment is one carleton lufteufel , the government official who detonated the doomsday device that contaminated the earth 's atmosphere with radioactivity . limbless painter tibor mcmaster sets off in his cart on a quest to find lufteufel to capture the god 's true visage in a painting . there 's some interesting speculation around the encounter between a vitiated christianity with this life-negating religion ( deus irae means `` god of wrath '' ) and a somewhat zen-like spiritual renewal may be found in the novel 's conclusion . the religious preoccupation gives the novel interest as a kind of reflection of dick 's other greater novels of the late 60s and 70s , despite the somewhat casual and fragmented history of its composition
