the final chapter ... or is it ? this is a book you expected massie to write ... ..since nicholas & alexandra was written in ( i think ) 1969 , an update since 1991 was critical . it gives you an idea what was being discovered in dna research and proving the bones found were who they were . its a book a romanov observer should have , or at least read to glean the information from . worth it , for sure .
