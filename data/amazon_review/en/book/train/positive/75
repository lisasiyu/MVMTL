great great book , definitely one of my favorite king novels . a lot more brutal and a lot better then the movie ( which was great ) . the only thing i did n't like were the exerts from `` misery 's return '' , i hate romance novels even if they are written by stephen king so i skipped over most of them . but the rest of the book was amazing and even though i 'd seen the movie and pretty much knew what was going to happen it still had me in suspense and hooked through the whole thing , i did n't want to put it down and finished it in 2 days ( which is fast for me ) . so if you 've never read a king book before this would be a good place to start
