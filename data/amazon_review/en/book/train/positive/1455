findind faith brian does a great job of thoughtfully and logically addressing basic questions that people face then trying to navigate the maze of `` spirituality '' in our culture . like the c. s. lewis classic `` mere christianity '' which is quoted often in the book it does not attempt supply all of the answers the `` life the universe and everything '' but offers thought provoking logical arguments for meaningful faith in a real god . his conversational style is easy to read and the arguments are compelling . i highly recommend it no matter where you may be on your spiritual journey
