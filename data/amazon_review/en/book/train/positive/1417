great book ! this book is very good for the beginner . but no unix book can teach everything . that 's why i found it better to also buy the unix essentials dvd . it 's way better when you have both . and it only costs $ 5,325.99 . you need these dvds . you really do ! hee hee ! just kidding . but i really am sick of all those fake reviews that advertise these over-priced dvds
