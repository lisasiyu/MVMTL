great synthesis of the spiritual disciplines as a chaplain in hospice care and for a professional sports team i am always looking for books that synthesize larger topics or `` weightier '' works and bring practical applications to the forefront . calhoun 's contribution does an excellent job of presenting ( succinctly ) the necessary introductions into the spiritual formation practices that have been a part of the church for so many years . the greatest advantage for myself is the ability to use this book as a launch pad into other parts of the community that cover the various disciplines in greater depth or detail . and the practical aspects of the book make this a necessary purchase ! this book is a must read for lay leaders , an excellent resource for pastoral leaders , and a welcome addition to any church , school , seminary , or personal library
