great supplementary reading . the most redeeming quality of this title is its readability . talbott is able to convey all the drama and excitment of life in international politics . that said , this certainly is n't a title which will help you get a complete understanding of india , pakistan and nuclear weapons . i read this book to supplement required reading for a course on war in south asia and it greatly helped in terms of reinforcing key events and players . i reccomend this to those who already have a reasonable understanding of the situation in south asia and want a bit of light reading and would like to see the soap opera aspect of the affair .
