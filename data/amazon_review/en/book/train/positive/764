this is a great book ! this books makes the cutest models and manipulative things ! if you make lapbooks , or notebooks for your units this would be the thing to get . there are things here i have seen nowhere else . it is adaptable up or down to the grade level it shows . perfect for homeschooling . i have used some of it in a group as well
