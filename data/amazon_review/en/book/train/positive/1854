looking for something similar ? i love this book ! it plays , quite successfully , with douglas adams 's idea/question of what happens to gods when people stop believing in them ? if you like this book you will also enjoy `` the long dark tea-time of the soul '' by douglas adams and `` american gods '' by pratchett 's friend neil gaimen ( though this one is darker and gritty - exploring some of the less flattering parts of america ) . `` good omens '' by pratchett and gaimen is a comedy about the end of the world . if you like the first three books i listed here you will like that one too .
