great book , but be aware of what it isn't this is a great book , and well worth purchasing if you want to learn about finances for investment properties . it is not all that it could be , but do n't let that stop you from using it to get started . all that having been said , here are the things that i had to be careful about : 1 ) ten performance measurements and ratios are presented in chapter 6 , and they represent the heart of the book . there is little overview of which ones are most importance or how to use or weigh conflicting or offsetting results . 2 ) the book is heavily centered on spreadsheets , which the author offers to sell to you . others have criticized the spreadsheets for being locked . i used the book to recreate my own version of the spreadsheets , and the extensive explanations in the book helped , mostly , to make sure that i got the underlying formulas correct . what i noticed , however , is that the book sorely needed a financially sophisticated editor . for example , the spreadsheet on page 193 has an entry for `` expense/foot . '' in fact , this entry is none other than the oer - operating expense ratio - that was developed in chapter 6 . why go to all the trouble to create and define ratios , if you are n't then going to use them . other parts of the spreadsheets were equally problematic . for example , the net cf 's - presumably `` cash flow '' - for a 3 year exit only had the receipts for years 1 and 2 , and not for year 3 . lastly , the book has nothing to say about ( a ) maintaining and growing a real estate portfolio of multiple properties as opposed to a single property , or ( b ) evaluating the relatively new 1031 multiple tenants in common investments that some long time owners are trading into in order to stop being a full time property manager as well as an investor .
