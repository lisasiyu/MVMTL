pretty neat book as the synopsis indicates , this book is about a cat that dies 8 times before it finds it 's life-to-be whle he is living the ninth . there 's a little angel-like picture of the cat with angel wings leaving each time the cat dies . it 's interesting but oftentimes , i think a little much for the toddlers . there 's a bunch of info in this book that makes it fun to discover and explore and actually , i think the artwork is better than the actual story . the idea behind this is good , but i think i agree with the other reviewers that more and equal focus should be placed on the story itself , and not just in the illustrations . my favorite part is seeing what 's going on behind the scenes in the illustrations alongside the pages . it 's a nice book but maybe look for another one of brett 's books if you 're reading this to a toddler . it 's not as entertaining as say her gingerbread baby book
