wow another great book , which comes as no surprise . the first book ends with him being removed from his home , permanently , due to his mother 's abuses . this book gives us an insider 's look at the foster home system , flaws and all , which rings quite true . i spent a week there myself , and have some delinquent cousins with a bit more experience . i suppose it 'd shock a lot of readers , however . meanwhile , what shocked me was that his mother was still part of his life . grr ! great book . it 's brilliant as well , and naturally i expect the same of the third part in this trilogy .
