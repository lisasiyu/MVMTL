makes me want to go build a new house i review a lot of architecture books , and this one more than most makes me want to go out and build a new house . the subject of the book is small houses . it consists of pictures and the story of some fifty houses , all of which are less than 1,300 square feet . many of them are much less than 1,300 feet , indeed down into the 300-400 square foot size . i live in a small house -- 900 square feet or so -- that 's about a hundred years old . but compared to the layout , the beauty the simplicity of design , mine 's a dump . i 'm getting the urge to go visit a realtor friend . one thing about these houses is that many of them are on what would be considered hard to build on lots . and such lots tend to be cheap . there 's a new architect in town that 's fresh out of school and may have more originality than the older guys . maybe if i give her this book , with a few houses marked . hmmmmm ! one thing i did n't like , most of the bed rooms are on the second floor . i was in a house once that had a fire . the amount of smoke generated in just a minute or two was incredible . i do n't want a bed room upstairs , if necessary i want to be able to close the door to keep the smoke out and get out through a wondow or emergency door . other than that , this is a great idea book . the pictures are beautiful . there 's not as much detail as i would like , but adding detail would have to mean either fewer houses or bigger book , so i guess it 's a nice balance
