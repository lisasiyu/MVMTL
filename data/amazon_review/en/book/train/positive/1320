it 's good ... even for men i know this may sound weird in light of the fact that powter has been labeled fem-nazi and the like , but she has a new male convert in me due to the sober and staying that way . it completely changed my view of her . i read the book non-stop from front to back . i immediately identified with the sugar/caffeine cravings whenever i tried to stop drinking . i knew/know from personal experience that eating/being healthy really helps me not drink . and i readily identified with her observations about current recovery programs . i was in some shock over the connections she makes between the government and big business , but that was naive on my part . this book really simulated a response from me on many levels . it may have saved my life and possibly my marriage
