excellent high resolution print found nowhere else i can use `` picture book '' to describe full moon , as images contributed as the major part of this book . do n't think that this book is not worth reading , indeed , it is on the contrary , this is an extraordinary book , because of the photos . there are a lot of astronomy books contain lots of photos , but when you read them , you would find the images are not so good at all , but not because of the photo itself , because of the low resolution . and if you are familiarize with those photos , you would immediately notice that the original photo is not so small in resolution . it is really a very bad idea for the publisher and editor to ignore the importance of image resolution . however , when you first look into full moon , you will find you 're getting into a different world as you are already delighted by the spectacular images of the moon taken from apollo mission . normally , owing to the technological limitation in 1960s and 1970s , all images are only mostly available as hard copy and not so high resolution . however , project full moon can turn those hard copies into very high resolution images . i can even tell you that , nasa even do n't have such high resolution images before . since these reasons , i would rank this book as my list of top 10 astronomy book . if you really love astronomy , you must not miss this book , miss the extraordinary journey to the moo
