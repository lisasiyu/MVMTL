do n't judge this book by its cover ! i 'd seen the movie `` valley of the dolls , '' whose characters are pictured on the cover of this book , but only recently did i read jacqueline susann 's magnum opus . what a pleasant surprise ! this engaging novel , despite its length , is a fast read . it is better -- far better -- than the film . ( the movie , however , is a `` must see '' for its over-the-top acting , 60 's fashions and `` so bad it 's good '' storyline . ) although initially billed ( to great effect ) as a steamy romance novel , the book is much more substantive . each of the characters is well-developed , and each has human flaws that lead to her success or spell her undoing . before it was fashionable , susann used the character of anne welles to explore one woman 's attempt to ignore the pressures to marry early and instead devote herself to a career . susann examined the problem of the abuse of legal drugs at a time when it was seen as primarily a teenage phenomenon . neely o'hara is initially a sympathetic character , but has enough of the `` bitter greens '' ( envy , jealousy and bile ) which , when added to an insatiable ego and a large quantity of pills , leads to her rise and fall . and jennifer north knows what she has and knows its advantages -- and limitations . these characters are real , and one need not be in show business to know them . although written in 1966 ( with a story that begins in 1945 ) , the plotline is not dated . neither is the message : susann asks whether having everything you ever wanted really is the key to happiness . there is a reason why this book has remained a bestseller and continues to enthrall a new generation of readers .
