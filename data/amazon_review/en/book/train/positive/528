well done book for church education staff this book is an excellent resource for church education staff . this book covers some basic principles ( or laws as he calls them ) regarding teaching in the church environment . the law of readiness is my personal favorite of the bunch , as it basicially states that both student and teacher must be prepared for the teaching environment . this is so true and often followed in higher education , but perhaps not very well followed in church education . the sad news is that typicially the teacher is blamed for the students poor scholarship or lack orf learning . but according to henricks a student must study , must come to class on time , and must be interested in the material to proactively learn . there is much more good stuff in this book . grab it its a great read
