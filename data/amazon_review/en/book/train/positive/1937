ca n't argue with results you can argue all you want about qualifications of mr. cherniske . but i will say that my daily caffiene intake was from 600-1100mg a day for years , i quit cold turkey about a month before i started reading the book ... and the withdrawal was incredible ... .headaches , shakes , irritable beyond belief . you ca n't say this is n't an additive drug while you 're slugging down four or more startbucks coffees a day . for months and months i 've had hard a time sleeping , waking up in the morning feeling like i have no energy at all . within two weeks of quitting caffien , i feel great . i still go to bed at 11:30-midnight and get up the same time at 5:45am , yet in the morning i can now get up without any problems and i 'm awake the whole day without fatigue , feeling more energized . i changed nothing else in my diet or routine . i still eat the same stuff as before and have not started exorcizing , or most of all ... have taken none of the suggested suppliments in the book . the only thing i did was stop drinking coffee/coke and started drinking more water . so save yourself a few bucks if you do n't want to buy the book , but do yourself a favor and cut out caffiene . the withdrawal sucks , but it does n't last for ever . if anything once you get through it , it will give you reason to stay away from caffeine . da
