nice introduction i like john 's style in writing this book . when i started studying manifolds , i had little understanding of some of the deep concepts of topology . this book was an excellent introduction . what is so cool about this book are the exercises , and they are all connected with each other . it makes a sumptuous meal . the other book on smooth manifolds is definitely on its way to being a classic among beginners
