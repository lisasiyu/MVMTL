if you 're struggling with behavior issues , read this book . exasperation with our son 's behavior led to the purchase of this book . he 's now 3 1/2 . he is high energy in most everything he does . he 's more energetic , more intense , more inquisitive , more dramatic . the older he gets , the `` more '' he has become . this book helped us understand that there are many other kids just like ours , that `` more '' is not bad ( like his prek teacher had us thinking ) and that parenting a spirited child requires a different set of skills . the author does n't give any one sure-fire way to help with the daily struggles you face with a spirited child , but she does direct you and help you to understand . without this book , we may have never understood what spirit is in a child
