great for me , but 40 years late this is an execellent book . on the downside i 'm 72 years old so i should have read this 40 years ago . the author is clear & it 's readable for most anyone . however i think today 's readers may find the material dated , with some cliche 's that were probably very `` hip '' in the mid '60 's . yet today i beleive we can con verese with most anyone & arrive at these type mind games on our own without the need of a therapist . if i were able to time travel back to the '60s , woodstock , timothy leary , ... & read this book with `` that '' mind-set , i would rate the book 5 big stars
