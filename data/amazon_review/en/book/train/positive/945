indispensable for western gardeners it 's about time somebody published an inspiring photo driven book about western gardens . the sunset western garden book may be the bible for western gardeners for its wealth of information but it does not serve to inspire the way a book full of real gardens can . with more than 500 photos of western gardens this book should be destined to be a classic . the great thing is that it is not just a beautifully designed , coffee table type book . the text is authoritative with dozens of full page charts and it seems to have been reviewed by a who 's who of garden experts . the author suggests plants from all over the world that are adapted to a summer-dry , mediterranean climate and the photographer shows them in gardens not just close-up details . hooray for this book . we western gardeners are too often frustrated by books and gardening advice originating from other regions . this book is so beautiful it will frustrate gardeners in those other regions who will want what we now have
