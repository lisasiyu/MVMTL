mcphee is amazing mcphee joins a merchant marine as he tries to find a ship to work on - hence the title - then journeys with him as the boat does its work . i picked this book up because i 've read other books by mcphee that make subjects that i would normally not even think about fascinating . this book was no exception . for readers who have read his geology series ( compiled into anals of the former world ) and found it a bit too technical and dry , this book will be a refreshing change . i never would have thought i 'd be interested in this subject , but mcphee made it interesting
