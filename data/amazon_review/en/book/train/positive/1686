a ride on the descending road of modern history `singapore grip ' recreates the world of pre-wwii singapore . farrell centers his tale around the blackett and webb conglomerate based on rubber plantations , but extends to wide-ranging export-import business . singapore was created to be a trading center for the british empire and it succeeded beyond any reasonable expectations . as war edges closer the air of unreality gets thicker . even when the japanese attack malaya in late 1941 , these people just do n't get it . singapore grip explores this world in detail and from many different perspectives . the higher in the colonial hierarchy , the harder it is for reality to penetrate . walter blackett , scion and head delusionist is still planning the company 's 50th jubilee while the japanese are bombing the island and even singapore town proper . `singapore grip ' is a vignette in what huxley called `` the descending road of modern history '' . the war gathers slowly , life begins to change , but not dramatically at first . but , the vise inexorably tightens and the world of the characters crumbles under the relentless pressure . escape from the island seems at first an absurd idea , but it gradually becomes ever more desirable until it finally becomes impossible in the crush at the quays . if you are tempted to turn away from this book , do n't . `singapore grip ' gathers force and clarity as farrell slowly adds the pieces to his masterful mosaic and the reader is duly rewarded . the book has been recently reprinted in the excellent new york review of books classics series . highly recommended .
