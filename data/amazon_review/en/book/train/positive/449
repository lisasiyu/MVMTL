a classic through and through this book is really good on many levels.theres really 2 stories going on.1 is how these 3 kids spent thier summer this one time , which is its more endearing side and the other story about this chick that got raped and how a racist town wants to pin it on this black dude.then theres this creepy boo radley guy and all in all its a great book.one of those you have to have read to call yourself educated about literature
