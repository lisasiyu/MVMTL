a darker phineas finn in phineas finn , anthony trollope wrote about a happy-go-lucky young irish member of parliament who romances the ladies and achieves a minor ministerial rank in the liberal government . a dispute with his party regarding the irish question , however , results in his leaving politics and returning to ireland . phineas redux brings phineas back , but the slogging is now harder . the vicious infighting between daubeny ( disraeli ) and gresham ( gladstone ) has soured phineas somewhat . he is repeatedly slandered by a yellow journalist named quintus slide ; and many in his party , including some of his friends , believe that the irishman is carrying on an adulterous affair with lady laura kennedy . at one point , the aggrieved husband takes a pot shot at phineas , but misses . matters turn still darker when j. bonteen , a political rival to phineas , is murdered one night in the street shortly after a quarrel with phineas at the universe club . the major set piece of phineas redux is the trial of phineas finn for the murder of bonteen . opinion is evenly split on the question of his guilt and the issue seems to be in doubt until mme max goesler , whose love finn had rejected in the earlier volume , conducts her own investigation and produces evidence that turns the tide and results in a resounding acquittal . if trollope were a lesser author , everything at this point would be all sweetness and light . here , however , phineas suffers what appears to be a nervous breakdown and contemplates pulling out of politics altogether . what trollope presents us with is an updated version of the book of job , with the difference that phineas averts his face from his new good fortune and concentrates on his losses . his good friends rally round the young m.p . and slowly wean him from his depression . the pot of gold at the end of this dark rainbow is mme max . phineas proposes to the wealthy young widow and is accepted
