a practical , result oriented approach when my wife left me , instead of telling me there was another guy , she was grasping at straws when she blurted out , `` you never listen to me . '' she did n't have the guts to tell me there was someone else , so i thought this was something i could fix . lost art was one of many books i bought in an effort to `` fix '' myself and save my marriage . of the books i purchased about listening , this book was the only one worth what i paid for it . there are some really terrible books out there on this subject . part two of my story ... .. my father was a man of few words ... ... especially over the phone . when i read lost art , i finally understood the `` dynamic '' between him and i . phone conversations which used to last a minute or two were now lasting thirty minutes . one conversation we had was about an hour long and at the end of it , he told me that he loved me ( which is a big deal in my family ) . a month later , my father went into intensive care . three months after that he passed away . i 'm so happy that we had those conversations because i do n't feel like we left anything unsaid between us . as for my marriage , it 's over . however , my soon to be ex and i get along very well . i wo n't say that we are good friends because that would be a lie . but i do beleive we are getting along a lot better than we would have if i had never read this book . i do n't believe she left me because of my lack of listening skills , but i do believe that we are getting along so well because of these new skills .
