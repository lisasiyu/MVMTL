a book to reread frequently one of the most wonderful things about rabbi kushner 's writings is that he is n't afraid to tackle the hard questions . if we indeed have a shepherd , why is n't he doing a better job ? to this question , kushner says , `` the psalmist would teach us to see the world , without illusions that nothing bad will ever happen , but without the fear that we will be utterly destroy this is a lovely book full of hope and wisdom . drawing on the individual lines of the twenty-third psalm , rabbi kushner ( known best for his book why bad things happen to good people ) creates 15 essays that are thought-provoking and inspiring . he outlines the historical background of the words of the psalm , noting `` the earliest ancestors of the hebrew people who gave us the bible were nomads , owning no property , bound to no one location but traveling with their flocks and herds wherever there was pastureland for the animals to graze on . '' the analogy of god to a shepherd makes perfect sense in that environment . the beauty of the analogy is that it still speaks to us today . the image which is evoked is one of caring and greater knowledge . ed by the things that do happen . '' kushner is skilled at relating biblical literature to questions and concerns of today . he relates the verse to terrorists , einstein and daily living . he provides insights and advice as to how we can live our lives more effectively . his words also provide hope to all of us : `` you may have to work hard to earn your living ... but you do n't have to work hard in order to feel good about yourself . all you have to do is stop striving , relax , and say to yourself , i feel good about who i am . '' this slim volume will stay in a handy place in my home for years to come . it 's a book i will come back to again and again for wisdom , courage and peace
