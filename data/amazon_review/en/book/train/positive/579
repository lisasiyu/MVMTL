excellent review of the enerhy situation very technical book with a great overview about energy and hydrocarbons in particular . i would not recommend this book as a first book about peak oil , this book is definately written for an audience that has more of a scientific background , but if you are concerned about the phenomenon of peak oil and have the ability to grasp basic scientific concepts , then this book is excellent . not so much political as some of the other peak oil books , deffeyes is a second generation petroleum man and a university professor . he deals with the fundamental aspects of peak oil as it relates to oil as a natural resource . still , i believe that this book is essential reading to anyone trying to come to grips with the idea of peak oil and i highly recommend this book to all concerned people that can deal with the basic science involved . peak oil is a fact , and everyone needs to understand the reasons why the human race needs to reduce our consumption of oil as soon as possible
