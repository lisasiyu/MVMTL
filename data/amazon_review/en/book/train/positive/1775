great use of conversational humor a friend of mine challenged me to find an example of a book that displays the one thing that remains southern in our late 20th-century culture , and with eudora welty 's & quot ; losing battles , & quot ; i found it ! southern families have been strung across american since the end of world war ii , but the one thing that keeps us together is the family reunion . welty 's work reconfirms this , and with her gift of conversational writing , created a masterpiece . if you 're lonely for a bit of catching up on family information , even though the one depicted here may not be your own family , this one is it
