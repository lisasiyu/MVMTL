history comes to life ! the bible is the deepest , most intelligent , and powerful writing ever penned . because it is such a profound book , parts of it may at times seem confusing . many times i struggled through the pages of the old testament trying to comprehend the history . sometimes i would give up , becoming weary of the long string of names or descriptions of who begat whom . why did god 's word have to be so difficult for me ? i so wanted to be able to read the bible and be as interested in its history as i was in the tudor era . of course , i never dreamed that there was a book out there just for me . when my mom presented me with adam and his kin by dr. ruth beechick i immediately devoured it . the story , the history , the bible ! mrs. beechick retells the story of genesis like no other author has . i found myself intrigued and delighted as i read about eve 's heartbreaking struggle in the garden of eden , the tragic murder of abel , the fascinating story of noah , and even the tower of babel . it was like reliving history beside these amazing figures and the spectacular events which surrounded them . i could actually feel eve 's longing for the forbidden , i mourned for noah as he was made fun of and taunted while he built the most amazing boat in the world , the boat that god instructed him to build . in adam and his kin history comes to life and you experience what life was like thousands of years ago . in my opinion , this book is a masterpiece and i can give it nothing but the highest praise . j.m . age 1
