grade school mental workout ! ! ! this book is the best of its kind -- nothing comes close to the number and variety of mental puzzles of various levels of difficulty ... word games , optical tricks , math puzzles , et cetera . this book is amazing . i 've given several to teachers . excellent for third grade up to high school . the only thing i 'd change about the book is the color : the book only has black , white , gray and blue
