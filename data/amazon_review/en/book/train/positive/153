excellent resource for understanding a complicated issue . dr. rydelnik has done an excellent job of synthesizing his study of history and the bible to bring clarity to an often-unclear issue . this book gives the reader a good grasp on the history , development , and current state of the the land of israel and the conflict with the palestinians . it also provides us with an invaluable , clear presentation of what the bible has to say on the issues of who can claim ownership of the land , and of israel and the arab states in prophecy . i highly recommend it to anyone who would like a better understanding of the middle east conflict , beyond what the headlines tell you .
