detailed transformations of algorithms for optimal desighns this is an excellent book , written by one of the authorities in the field . it offers detailed design techniques that will help the system designer explore the 3-dimension design space and achieve optimizations in all or either of : area , time , energy consumption . the use of specific examples illustrates the techniques , while complicated backround information is well-organized in the appendices . i used the book as a recommended text book in my 1-semester `` vlsi signal processing '' graduate-level class and the students really loved it . it covers all availble techniques , from the simplest to the most advanced ones , with full explanation of the theory , with complete and detailed implementation steps for a wide range of signal processing algorithms.since the book does not deal with the design at the physical level , but with transformations of the processing algorithms so that their vlsi implementations will satisfy certain criteria of optimality , it is not absolutely mandatory that the reader has already taken courses in vlsi design , although this could help appreciate the benefits offered by the techniques detailed in the book . the exercises found at the end of each chapter help the reader apply the learned techniques in all kinds of applications . i am convinced that the thoroughness and the high standards accomplished by the author in the writing of this book will help establish it as the leading text or reference book for several years to come
