far , far superior to guyton , in my opinion . both guyton texts i received were manufactured defectively , coming unglued along the strap of the spine . poor job , saunders . typical . vander 's human physiology is an excellent textbook in the sense that it answers all of the right questions at the right time , while you are studying . also , more chemistry in vander 's , and in the long run that was important to me , since the atom is the basis of everything . beautiful illustrations and photographs , and again , when compared to guyton ( where the illustrations were cheap and even shameful ... made by a high school art student ? ) the professional presentation and pedagogical context of dr. eric widmaier 's text was much better than the `` old '' standard . depth of coverage in some areas might be slightly less , but still the learning is there for the taking . i love this textbook , and i am convinced students studying from it will fair as highly on board examinations as those trying to learn from any other standard text in the field of introductory physiology .
