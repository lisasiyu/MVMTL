`` streamers '' : a powerful glimpse at military life `` the vietnam plays , volume two , '' by david rabe , contains two plays : `` streamers '' and `` the orphan , '' together with a 1992 afterword by the author . the book includes production information on both plays . `` streamers '' was produced and staged in 1976 , and `` the orphan '' was first produced professionally in 1973 . `` streamers '' looks at a group of army soldiers who are facing the possibility of being sent to vietnam while the war is going on . rabe focuses on a group of three roommates , all junior soldiers . as these troops talk and argue together with the other soldiers in the play , rabe shows how tensions within the military can create fracture lines along many axes of difference : race , sexual orientation , educational background , rank . early on in the play rabe introduces the theme of homosexuality in the army ; this theme plays a significant role as the story unfolds . also explored is the relationship between younger troops and experienced combat veterans . `` streamers '' is a play that may seem a deceptively straightforward slice of military life , but i found it to be a dense and complex text , rich in irony , that rewards careful reading . it 's a powerful play that effectively presents a group of military personnel as a microcosmic world of tension , lust , anxiety , anger , and violence . particularly piercing is rabe 's look at the intersection of verbal `` violence '' and physical violence . i found `` the orphan '' far less interesting than its companion piece . in it rabe melds ancient greek lore with late-20th century american concerns . although the play has some strong moments , overall i felt it lacked effectiveness . i felt that rabe missed a golden opportunity to really use the trojan and vietnam wars to shed light on each other . nevertheless , the presence of `` streamers '' in this volume makes the book well worth owning , especially for those with an interest in the literature of war . recommended companion text for `` streamers '' : `` a sense of honor , '' a novel by james webb
