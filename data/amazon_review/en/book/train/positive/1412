uncovering the realism of mountaineering ... a real look into the world of mountaineering that has n't been glamorized or overly dramatized ( in the case of other authors ) . the primary focus is denali , but the book often shifts attention away from it , giving the reader a good look into the mountaineering career of jon waterman and a bit of insight upon many others . for the experienced mountaineer , they can most likely relate to many of jon 's experiences . to the less experienced , it will give a sobering wakeup call to the realities of mountaineering . i must disagree with the reader from ny listed below as stating that & quot ; the author falls into the trap of thinking that climbing is going to give him and some other fellow climbers an insight into life beyond that of the ordinary man. & quot ; for anyone who has survived a truly epic climb , one does gain a bit of insight into life that they failed to notice beforehand , and that many others do not completely understand ... do this regularly enough , and it can in fact change a person . the book was not self-indulgent in the least ... merely giving a first hand account of his experiences , both good and bad . if you are planning a trip to denali , this should be required reading ...
