for the philosopher of mind , this is the start of the road . *disclaimer : i am writing this as a philosopher of mind so any parts of the book or chapters not related to this are not what i am addressing . * i do not mean to say that bennett and hacker have all the answers , but their `` ordinary language '' approach , along with their debt to wittgenstein , ryle , kenny and strawson , says something about their book . most contemporary philosophers of mind ( sprague , strawson and hacker , among others , excluded ) have rightly dismissed the soul , but have decided that there is something `` mysterious '' about consciousness , or perception or emotion , or what have you . in response , bennett and hacker have shown what `` consciousness '' really is : the conscious acts of people existing in the world . this is why we know that other people are conscious actors : they do conscious things such as watch birds , or play chess , or eat ham sandwiches . if michael tye 's or david chalmers ' or colin mcginn 's problems of consiousness ( e.g . that i can know that you feel the same pain that i feel , or that you see the same color that i see ) are indeed problems for you , you should read this book ; if it does n't prove to you that they are not problems at all , at least it will give you a new way of looking at the problems so that you may come to your own interesting conclusions
