from a deep well i was introduced to william willimon through his sermons . he is a genius preacher and a prolific writer , having published hundreds of sermons and dozens of books . the insights in pastor are the fruit of a life long lived in god 's service . it is not easy being a pastor amidst the cultural mega-shifts underway . many of us find ourselves in the throws of a vocational identity crisis . what in the world are pastors to give themselves to ? are they primarily preachers , chief executive officers , ones who empower the laity , counsellors in the clinical vane or spiritual directors in the catholic tradition ? drawing from a deep well of theological and historical insight , as well as years of pastoral experience , willimon tackles these and other questions arranged in thirteen well-crafted chapters covering the full spectrum of pastoral theology . pastor balances theory and practice , and is full of real-life examples from willimon 's own experience . one example is the way he comes against the individualist spirit of north american christianity , and calls for pastors to see themselves as participants with all of god 's people in transformative communities of faith and not merely as religious managers . i only wish that i had this resource twenty years ago .
