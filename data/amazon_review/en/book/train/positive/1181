always check the language notes before buying a book i ca n't believe the only 2 bad reviews were given by people who di n't know the book was written in spanish . i read the book and i personally give it 10 stars for its historic content among other things . first , the title is written in spanish , not german nor english ! ! ! second , if you feel the vendor did n't provide an accurate description of the book such as the language edition do n't blame the book . further , if you want to blame somebody because you ca n't read the book , blame the editors for not publishing an english version . not all books are translated into english and viceversa . third , for those who wrote the bad reviews give yourself 20 stars for publicly admitting that you were careless/stup.. enough to buy a book that you could n't read . under the editorial reviews you have this note : language notes text : spanish i hope this note helps for those would be buyers . gracias .
