pure beauty i can not rave enough about this book ; certainly i have not been moved like this by a literary work in some time . gorgeous from start to finish- sometimes whimsical , sometimes heartbreaking , always intelligent , fresh , and full of magic . clarke 's writing is impeccable and a pure joy to read . one always has the sense that she 's subtly mocking her characters even as she allows us to love ( or hate ! ) them . the story is breathtaking and moves along with exquisite pacing . allow yourself to be lost in her world !
