beautifully done ! elizabeth strout comes back better than ever with this wonderfully written story . a family subsumed by grief , confined by societal norms , is able to , in their own way , overcome obstacles and begin to find the true meaning of love . unfortunately , the ending did n't quite live up to the rest of the book , but still well worth a read
