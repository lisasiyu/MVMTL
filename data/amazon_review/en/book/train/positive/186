great read for those interested in travel , foreign affairs i finished kaplan 's ends of the earth today . i liked the book . kaplan has consistently been one of my favorite authors ( atlantic monthly ) his theme is consistent : many nation states are not really nation states . i felt that his comments about iran were especially poignant , given how some view iran as part of the `` axis of evil '' . i get the sense that when this book was written , kaplan had great hope for the future of iran as they struggle with theocracy . ecocide , or the killing of natural resources is a new topic for me that kaplan introduces . according to kaplan , many developing nations have traded immediate benefits for the long term health of their natural resources . his observations are very very interesting , especially his observations from the post-soviet nations like uzbekistan . kaplan is a bold , imaginative and thoughtful writer , he is not merely another journalist or another travel writer . his message , right or wrong , is sincere and based on his own personal observations . i highly recommend this work for anyone interested on new perspectives in current affairs .
