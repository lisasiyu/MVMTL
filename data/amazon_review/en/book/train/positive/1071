a mystery about foxhunters - with clever dialogue i have enjoyed all of the mrs. murphy mysteries , in part because i 'm a cat-and-dog person . the illustrations are a plus , done by people who really know and love animals . outfoxed is written in ms. brown 's easy-to-stay-with style , with lots of commentary from the animals involved . the book may tell more about foxhunting than you might care to know , but rita mae brown makes the human and animal characters so likable that you keep wanting to know what happens to them next . i hope she will give us more books in this style , as well as keeping on in her collaboration with sneaky pie brown in stories about mrs. murphy 's doings
