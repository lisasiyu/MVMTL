best engineering text on statistics the third edition has been improved but has the same practical feel as earlier editions . real data is used for most examples and having the `` entire book '' on a cdrom including the data sets , solution manual and supplimental material puts this text `` over the top '' in terms of usefulness . it is an excellent reference for the practical engineer who uses statistics only occasionally . i use this in industry and teach internal ( to the company ) courses using this text . the cdrom really makes it the text of choice
