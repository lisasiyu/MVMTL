master of figure and fantasy this book collects a series of boris ' paintings , plus a few very detailed pencil drawings , done between 1979 and 1982 . if you 're not already familiar with boris ' work - well , you probably are whether you know it or not . he has done years work of book covers for edgar rice burroughs , as well as reams of posters . the one constant through all his work is passion for the human form and human power , both male and female . these paintings range from the lush and sensual to humorous or macabre . a hookah come to life has a demonic presence , but a bar of soap come to life ( and licking the bather ) is more charming and a little silly . even the simplest pictures have overtones - that bather is truly a beautiful woman , leaving me just a little envious of such close contact . maybe not envious either , but off in thoughts of my own . and the preface is right , 'erotic ' is much too simple a word for all the different feelings and combinations of feelings that come from having or holding a strong , healthy body . my only complaint is a sameness in the female figures presented . the faces are beautiful , long and elegant , but mostly the same . the figures - the one figure , really is beautiful , but i value the uniqueness of a figure and the differences between figures . cloning can serve a narrative purpose , certainly , but sameness wears . even the loveliness of danielle anjou , acknowledged as a principal model and collaborator , wears . boris is the master of the figure in fantasy art , and has been for many years . this is a great sample from an earlier time in his career . it 's almost impossible not to like . //wiredweir
