amazing this is a great book . it is written for the common person that may not be all too interested in history . i could hardly put it down . after having to read hundreds of tedious history books for my degree , it was nice to read something with a bit of emotion . while he can not be 100 % accurate all the time it is still very good for people who want a swift read about wwii soldiers
