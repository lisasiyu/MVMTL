needed more suspense . after box 's first three excellent books , i found this a bit lacking . it felt very slow at times and had a number of things left unexplained . i do n't mind the element of mysticism but it did n't feel complete . joe , his family and friends are great characters , the story definitely had me turning the pages and completing it in a day but it was n't quite as strong as his previous books . do n't misunderstand ; this is still a very good read and a series i shall continue to follow , but i hope the next entry will have a bit more suspense to it .
