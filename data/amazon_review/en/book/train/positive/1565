a poet remembers his prairie town if one hears the name sandburg , the first thing to come to mind is probably & quot ; fog & quot ; or & quot ; city of big shoulders. & quot ; but in reading this wonderful memoir , we are reminded of what a fine prose writer the man was . the tale of his struggling swedish immigrant parents finding their way in late nineteenth century america and young & quot ; charley & quot ; as he liked to be called , as the name carl marked him as a foreigner , is a fascinating glimpse of a bygone time and place . the interesting jobs that young carl took on , such as traveling the back roads selling stereo-optican views , and his conversations with a civil war vet are rewarding and insightful . i believe this is a wonderful read for anyone with a love of biography , history , or simply good storytelling
