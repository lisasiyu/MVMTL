magnificently engrossing novel , finest kind entirely involving , entertaining and nuanced ( that 's the new adjective , right ? ) novel about hollywood ( woo-hoo ) during the huac witchhunt . some might call this book a soap-opera but , would that be so bad ? most everything the revered faulkner wrote is not only soap opera but , gasp , southern gothic soap opera . loved this book which brings back to public consciousness a black period for the u.s. and for democracy and discusses it with a grey palette . wonderful , exquisite , consuming reading . well written , with very knowing eye and irony ; it 's a do-not-miss-book !
