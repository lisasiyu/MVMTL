great book ! i suggest this book to anyone who wants to , or are thinking of , delving into c - no matter how deep ! what i love about this book is that it 's good for a non-motivated person like me as well , because the exercises at the end of each chapter really make me wanting to finish them up ( sort of like how teacher used to make us do it in high school . ) if you think you already know the material of a chapter , then just skip to the exercises and try to see if you can do those - if you can , then just continue on . if you ca n't , then simply check over the chapter again to re-test your knowledge
