the highlight of the five volume set ( thus far ... ) [ ... ] this five volume history of the victorian bourgeois follows a freudian schematic : the first volume dealt with love , the second with sex , and this volume with agression . this book was my favorite of the three i 've read so far . gay picks apart the victorian penchant for cloaked agression with admirable scholastic fortitude . his discussion of foucault 's theory of prisons is a high light for this entire five volume set . his critique of what he calls the `` social control '' theorists is that they fail to take into account the ability of the powerful to delude themselves into thinking they are doing the right thing , even when they are most assuredly not . why stop here ? only two more volumes to go..
