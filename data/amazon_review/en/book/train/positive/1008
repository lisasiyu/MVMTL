is it reality or a blend of reality and fantasy ? i read this book thirty years ago ( do you think i waited long enough to write this review ? ) and enjoyed it very much , but found it perplexing . i , myself , am a yogi , but this story would strike most people as being a blend of truth and fantasy . but what is wrong with that ? it is a beautiful story that teaches us many things about the way yogis look at life -- and death . do not approach this book with a critical eye on truth . instead , think of it as a type of epic poem . reflect on the reality of it at your leasure ! one thing is true about this book : the author wrote this book with great love of all humanity ! if you have developed an interest in some aspect of yoga and want to learn something more of what traditional yoga ( as opposed to the `` designer '' versions touted lately ) is about , give this a try
