another good book not sure if this is the last book in the series or not . it ends abruptly . however , it was a good book to read , so 4 stars . i had artemis fowl , and 2 charlie bone books at the same time . i read all , but my kids dropped charlie in favor of artemis . hence the 4 stars . as usual , the series becomes somewhat predictable - evil always bullies , good never seems strong enough to resist , some unknown char has to help them out
