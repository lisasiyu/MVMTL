not just for secondhand shoppers ! i think this is the only book of its kind on the market now , so i would recommend it if only for this reason to women who like to dress well at low cost . however , it 's better than i expected , thanks to an author who gives very detailed information about what makes a garment well constructed , down to the buttons . this book is useful for anybody shopping for clothes anywhere , new or not . it 's probably even a great gift for someone who sews their own clothes , that 's how detailed it gets about garment construction . this book 's main audience are women who want to get bargains on designer clothes ( it even gives helpful lists of designer names and their & quot ; poor cousin & quot ; lines ) , and therefore are more likely to shop consignment rather than thrift . it 's still helpful to vintage/thrift shoppers too ( especially section on stain removal ) but i wish she had included more tips for those shoppers , as well as more info on shoes . i think a sequel is in order because i think the author probably has a lot more to say . if so , please include a chapter on shopping for clothes online . this book has nothing on this topic , which is an art in itself ! i 'd also like to recommend al hoff 's thrift score
