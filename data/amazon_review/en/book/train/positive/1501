the book that changed my attitude about tough times . robert schuller 's book & quot ; tough times never last but tough people do & quot ; gave me the insight to understand life and the knowledge that everyone goes through tough times at some point in their lives . the challange is how we deal with those times and how each one of us can take these difficult situations and turn them around into something miraculous . when you think you just ca n't take one more step and you read this book you will know that you can and as dr. schuller says , & quot ; inch by inch anything 's a cinch ! & quot ; if you are going through very tough times i strongly suggest you read this book so that you too can become a & quot ; possibility thinker & quot ; and turn your & quot ; scars into stars & quot ;
