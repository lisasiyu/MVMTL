brings us back to the basics i 'll always be a country girl at heart , and this book appeals to that heart . i got philip gulley 's book and & quot ; people of passion & quot ; by carl mays at the same time , and immensely enjoyed them both ( even though they are quite different ) . front porch tales is about the author 's life and the people with whom he has come in contact in his small town . through short , interesting , and witty stories , he reveals much about human nature and what makes people tick . through his tales , gulley emphasizes grabbing hold of life and really living it rather than just plodding through . it 's a simple book , but certainly one that should not be overlooked , because of the value it offers . this easy , flowing , and fun read left me uplifited and i recommend it to other readers who want to get more out of the life that god has given them .
