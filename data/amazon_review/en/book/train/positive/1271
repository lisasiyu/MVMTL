a great read in november of 1985 when i was seven years old my fatherwas watching a mini series ( remember those people ) on cbs . it was kane and abel and after watching it for the last 22 years i have been fasinatied with that story . i did not know until 2006 that it was a book so i bought it and its sequel . i loved the prodigal daughter although i do have some things i would have done differently . i for one who have call the book the prodigal children with a focus on richard childhood as well . one of my favorite things in the novel was that while florentyna was a democrat richard was a repulican ( the good kind not the crazy ones you have today . ) i guess becuase although there is around a 10-15 year age difference between the chacters and my own parents that is how they are . ( my favorite scene in this is when richard puts a barry goldwater bumpersticker on their car she rips it right off . another one is when richard after telling his wife that he did not cheat on her florentyna said `` you should have slept with her '' meaning richard 's old girlfriend becuase that would have cemeted a business deal ) i also did not like fact that richard died and they brought in edward wincheaster as a second husband or that the book went into a future that never could come true . but then again that is nit picking . by the way a book in which a blond 60 something chicago born woman seantor becomes the first female united states president . hillary some british guy made you polish
