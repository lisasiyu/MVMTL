what i 've been waiting for ! ! ! i saw the group of eight in concert about a month ago and i was so disappointed to see the performance end . i really enjoyed their poetry and this book just gave me another dose of it . sometimes you need another dose to fully get into poets , because when beau sia came to northern michigan university , i did n't care for him . i did n't think he was funny . but when i saw him in chicago , i cracked up . poets are funny people . sometimes they just take some getting used to and some grow on you before they can open their mouth ( i.e . lemon ) . i 'm curious why the ninth poet was n't on the tour , but atleast i got to read his poetry in this book , which was excellent from beginning to end . my favorite poem is & quot ; love poem & quot ; by lemon , but the rest are all good in separate styles . all the different techniques and language are what make this group so entertaining . keep up the great work ! i was advertising for them coming to chicago like i would get commission for it and i 'm going to do the book the same way
