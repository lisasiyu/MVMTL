this `` masterpiece '' should be required reading for `` every '' mormon ! i too , having done much research on mormonism over the years as others , had put off reading this `` excellent '' expose while doing research on other cultic religions . i finally sat down to read this `` work of art '' and truly believe it should be `` required '' reading for every single practicing mormon , but as god gives each and every one of us a `` free will `` of choice , i can only pray that mormons in their `` delusionment '' will read these reviews and purchase the book for themselves and seek the `` real truth '' in the word of god , the bible ! not only did fawn brodie do a wonderful work in her own research of mormonism , but also tied together `` masterfully '' the research and writings of others on this `` cultic '' religion to conclude with a `` true '' masterpiece in print ! with `` all '' of the thousands of expose 's on the writings and actions of this `` false prophet '' joseph smith , i 'm truly `` amazed '' that millions of people continue to embrace and follow this `` false '' religion ! we have many verses , of course , in god 's word that speak to the very `` issue '' of `` spiritual blindness '' ! i find it truly `` amazing '' and a `` paradox '' that joseph smith went to great lengths in his life to expose the false doctrine of `` catholicism '' only to `` replace '' it with his `` own '' false doctrine ! i would `` encourage '' all mormons to take a look at this book with a truly `` open mind '' and an `` open heart '' to the truth of god 's word in the bible . we are not `` gods '' and will never become `` gods '' either in this life or life `` after '' physical death !
