dreams in action i love the idea of this book , the story behind it , and the wisdom it contains . with a great mix of inspiration and nuts-and-bolts information , the book covers a multitude of topics , and gives the reader room to expand on her own ideas . this would make a great graduation present , new-phase-in-life present , or a `` big '' birthday present for someone who has put her `` try-it '' days behind her .
