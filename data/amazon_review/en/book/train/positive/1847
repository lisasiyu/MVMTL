fascinating ! as i am a scholar and an expert of na-dene groupings , i find this to be one of the most fascinating and remarkable volumes of the handbookd of north american indians . the photos and linguistic data are absolutely fascinating and the authentic information -that so captivates every micro-molecule of my attention- is astonishingly elating ! i have recently been able to determine -thanks to the many rare and authentic photos of this book- that many of the northern 'athapaskan ' tribes are not totally 'mongoloid ' , as i had previoiusly surmised . i have discovered indian ( from 'india ' ) and turkish strains that are especially , concentrated in northeastern british columbia and northwestern-northwest territory bands . these findings have shed much light on my na-dene origin theories , regarding the genetic makeup of the na-dene forbears . awesome ! !
