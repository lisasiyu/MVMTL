great for the cartoonist this is a well done cartooning book . as an amatuer with only a hint of talent at drawing , i gained a great deal fromt this book . it helps you to see the simple shapes that most cartoons start from and how to build upon it . it is more geared toward the teen audience , but adults and even young children could gain much from it . the directions are simple to follow and there are tons of examples and illustrations . even a non-artist like me was able to turn out some impressive cartoons . this would be a great book for anyone interested in drawing and/or cartooning
