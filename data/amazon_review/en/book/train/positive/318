try not to get over whelmed by the technicalities ... this is a technically meaty book for the medical professional that can overwhelm the layperson . yet the area of autism , asperger 's syndrome and pdd study is in desperate need of the fresh out-of the-box thinking that this book provides . a parent can learn alot skimming over the `` why 's '' and `` what fors '' . for example ; focusing on bold print sub-points instead of trying to follow the fine points of metabolism described in the following paragraphs , will serve you well . this book will give you a good overview of groundbreaking research and treatment . most of all , it will give parents hope that our children may still be capable of functioning better , not just coping with limitations .
