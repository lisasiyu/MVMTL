oriental haute cuisine with no gimmicks , by a master two weeks ago my girlfriend snow and i dined at tetsuya 's new restaurant mju at the millenium knightsbridge hotel in london , prompted by snow 's raving of tetsuya from her winters in sydney . the only dining option is an eight-mini-course tasting menu , but since the man himself was in town ( tetsuya spends only one week a month in london ) we were all for it . we thought the portions were adequate , but i suspect people used to nyc portions might go home hungry . i must say that his cuisine was awesome - highlighting the flavors of fresh ingredients , and many of the courses were based on raw or undercooked items . although the presentation of the food was highly stylised - just look at the photos in the cookbook and they are similarly presented at your table - the cooking is unfussed and the philosophy predominantly reflected the japanese appreciation for simplicity and french classical culinary techniques . the result was that every dish managed to emphasize yet enhance the flavor of the main ingredient . compared to nobu , tetsuya is hardly fusion and very asian at heart . most of the courses served at mju are included in the cookbook , so we know that these recipes have been tried and tested . what 's most gratifying is the listing at the end of the book of food sources for mju - london lags nyc in terms of high-end food stores such as dean & amp ; deluca and citarella , so the list is very useful , and it allows me to dream about learning to cook at the level of a master like tetsuya
