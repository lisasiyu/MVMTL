engaging exercises to train your intuition famous mathematicians have often emphasized the role of visual intuition ; e.g. , hilbert : & quot ; who does not always use along with the double inequality a & gt ; b & gt ; c the picture of three points following one another on a straight line as the geometrical picture of the idea & quot ; between & quot ; ? who does not make use of drawings of segments and rectangles enclosed in one another , when it is required to prove with perfect rigor a difficult theorem on the continuity of functions or the existence of points of condensation ? & quot ; ( from his famous address at the 1900 international congress ) . this book is a collection of well over 100 one-page proofs , collected from various sources . the topics range from number theory to calculus , and most of them require no advanced mathematics . typically there is a statement of a result , with a labelled diagram showing how it is & quot ; proved & quot ; ; in some cases there are a few auxiliary equations along with the picture . these are not simple , often requiring quite a bit of thought before the & quot ; aha ! & quot ; moment . working through them is a valuable exercise for the student of mathematics -- having seen , e.g. , six different visual proofs of the pythagorean theorem , one comes to really *understand* the result , not just & quot ; follow the logic & quot ; . i have not encountered any better way than this book to & quot ; see & quot ; how mathematical truth is discovered and proved . it can be valuable as a supplement to courses through precalculus and elementary calculus . perhaps one of its best uses is to inspire teachers to present results in a more lively way then & quot ; definition-theorem-proof & quot ; or & quot ; just memorize it & quot ;
