this is where i came in ... stormy weather was the first hiaasen novel i read . i picked up a paperback copy at a remainder sale . never heard the name of the guy and did n't expect much ; but it was cheap , and so ... boy , was i wrong ! since then i have made sure that i read every hiaasen in and out of print , and i 'm about to catch up on some of his real old stuff . his writings opened up the world of the writers and the universe of that nook of america called 'florida ' , which is about as whacky and demented as it comes . actually , i 've _been_ to florida , though not down to the keys ; but it 's amazing what you miss when you basically just pass through or dip in and out of it . no wonder piers anthony used it as the setting for a bunch his , firmly tongue-in-cheek , fantasy novels . stormy weather , to get back to the subject , piled on charcaters i 'll never be likely to forget , from the skull-juggling augustine to the simply impossible 'skink ' . a never-ending litany of ascerbically presented character sketches and hiaasen 's usual -- entirely justified ! -- tirade and caricature of venal politicians , environmental rape and greed ; plus some truly and honestly _stupid_ people . fun and games and i never looked back . there are other 'florida ' writers i 've come to like , especially james hall and laurence shames . depending on my mood , i sometimes like them better than hiaasen , especially laurence shames . all three of them offer different perspectives on life in and beyond that strange place called 'florida ' . as i said , it depends on my mood . hiaasen usually ends up at the top when i 'm in a 'south park ' disposition ; needing satire with heart . and i need some more of that now and soon and please ! till noever , owlglass.co
