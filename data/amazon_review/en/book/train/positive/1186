do n't know what i 'd do without it ! i 'm a science copyeditor , and i truly do n't know how i 'd manage without this book . if it has to do with chemistry , it 's here ( thank heaven ! ) . and there 's a wealth of clear information about how to format math , a wonderful list of unit abbreviations , and even a fair amount about physics- and biology-related terminology . it has the most lucid and concise explanations i 've seen about when to apply italics or roman . and it 's reasonably priced . of course , if you specifically need to follow acs style , this book is de rigeur , but even if you do n't , you 'll find it invaluable for science copyediting
