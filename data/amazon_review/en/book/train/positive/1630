very good book i used this book as a primary preparation tool for the sun certified business component developer ( scbcd ) exam . being a beginner in ejb , i found this book to be very friendly . i liked the layout of the book in general and the writing style of the author in particular . only relevant pieces of code are presented to focus explanation of topic in question . a complete running application may be downloaded from the author 's website . the multiple choice questions at the end of every chapter and alerts in every chapter made remembering main points easier . deployment descriptor elements are clarified in considerable detail and they are explained well . please note that there are errors in this book - some of them are fairly obvious such as using a capital letter as opposed to a small letter ( java versus java ) while others are not so obvious but noticeable by experienced java developers . regardless of its minor faults , i consider this book to be a valuable addition to my library . normally i would have a cut a star for the errors but because of its content quality , i felt compelled to give 5 stars . i just passed the exam today thanks to this book . i know that i will not hesitate to buy another book from this author . thanks mr.sanghera ! i recommend this book highly without any reservations whatsoever
