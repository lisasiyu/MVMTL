habermas ' opus is timely ! the german political and social philosopher jurgen habermas is heir to the semantically rich tradition of frankfurt school thinkers . these men ( and sadly , they are mainly men , although hannah arendt is in some sense in this circle ) were seriously threatened by the collapse of the weimar republic . their decision to go into exile in the united states should probably be controversial . habermas is profoundly influenced by marx , weber , freud , and talcott parsons , and wrote this book in the context of uprisings against the viet nam war . what we are seeing right now , bush versus gore in a contested election in which the very structure of the united states government is being questioned , could be illuminated by careful study of this book . i commend it to the attention of anyone who would better understand a moment in united states history which has been descibed as a constitutional crisis
