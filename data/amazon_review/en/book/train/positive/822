an amazing life story this book is a wonderfully informative and touching story of a great and honorable man . through totch we learn of a nearly forgotten way of life and we see the everglades as it used to be . i appreciate his honesty and plainspokeness and i 'm thankful totch made this book to preserve an important history . i also recommend the three movies made about him : totch brown 's tales of the everglades and 10,000 islands , the everglades outlaw totch brown , and yesterday 's everglades
