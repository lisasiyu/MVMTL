welcome back ! another great story in the world of dragonlance ! i was so sad at the end of the war of souls trilogy , as i thought it meant the end of the world of krynn for me ... i was wrong , and i celebrated the day i found out that margaret and tracy were writing prequels . however , after the star wars debacle , i was slightly concerned that this was going to be a `` phantom menace '' . i am glad to say it is not . this book takes place between autumn twilight and winters night , and revolves around riverwind 's evacuation of the slave of pax tharkas after the rebellion , and tanis , raistlin , sturm caramon , flint , and tas 's search for the hammer of kharas - used to make the dragonlances . this book focuses largely on flint , which awesome considering that he played a much diminished role for the majority of the series . flint leads the companions in the search and has to deal with the dwarven bureaucracy and xenophobia in thorbardin . compounding the difficulty is an especially clever and ambitious draconian who has fooled the world into thinking lord verminard still lives . i swear , fans of tas will love this book - as always he has some of the best lines and gets himself into the strangest situations . my only criticism , [ which is not aimed at the authors ] and one shared by many reviewers , is the abysmal editing . there were missing words , spelling errors , type-o 's and so forth . while this does not detract from the well-conceived plot , it does slow the natural flow of the read . hopefully the publishers will take an extra week for editing on the next instalment . anyhow , this was a great read for fans of the series ! relic11
