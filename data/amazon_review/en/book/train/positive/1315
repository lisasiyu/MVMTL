lindskold is back on track in the fourth installment in jane lindskold 's ongoing wolf series , the heroine firekeeper , her sentient wolf companuion blind seer , and her friend derian carter have all been kidnapped and taken to a nation called loglimi well south of the locales of their previous adventures . the loglimish are aware of the intelligence of the 'royal beasts ' firekeeper was raised by , and the creatures play an important part in their religion ; so the prospect of being able to establish through firekeeper better communication with the wise beasts is enticing and , at the same time , potentially threatening to many loglimi . as in the opener of the series , firekeeper 's entry into the court , or in this case temple , produces considerable friction . firekeeper is soon busy investigating the strange relationship between the loglimi and their animals ; at the same time ( and the reader may have to stretch a bit to accept this development ) she learns more of her own background . and there are , of course , nefarious plots underway which require the unique talents of firekeeper , blind seer , and derian to defeat them . no time is wasted in setting up the story ; the capture takes place before the first page . as a result , the other continuing characters from the series are n't present at all . but the removal to a new location avoids the feeling of staleness that crept into the previous volume . that makes this the best book in this series since the first
