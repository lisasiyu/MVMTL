a comic gem ! 'the dog of the south ' is a perfect novel . this sounds like hyperbole . it is short ; there is very little in the way of plot ; the characters do not develop in any way : yet the book is as engaging and entertaining as anything i have ever read . before embarking on my second reading ( just a fortnight after i finished my first ) i planned to write down my favourite lines from the book . i gave up because i was transcribing almost the entire novel . no synopsis can do it justice . ray blount , jr. has said of this book that 'no-one should die without reading it . ' i 'm with him all the way
