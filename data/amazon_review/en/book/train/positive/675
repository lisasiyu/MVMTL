it is a lovely notebook however it was not for me all i really wanted was some place where i could keep track of the books i read and my thoughts on them . this book is wondefully laid out but it is oriented more for people who belong to reding groups or book clubs etc . if you just want a little book diary for yourself then do not buy this book . do yourself a favor and buy a regular notebook but if you do belong to a group or like to discuss your books then this is an excellent buy
