interview with the vampire i read this book when it first came out in paperback and have since read most of the others . the reason for my recent purchase of the book was for a friend who enjoyed reading it and has since purchased book 2 . all the vampire chronicle books i have read i have enjoyed and would recommend them to anyone interested in reading these types of books
