curriculum at its best i 'm reading this book as part of english at my school , and i find it 's absolutely brill ! allie 's a real inspiration to me , as i 'm planning to be an actress myself . and though askew seems too dark for me , he 's proven of great interest . we 're even using kit 's style of writing from his story of lak for future stories in the curriculum . we have n't read part 3 yet , but when we do , i bet it 's just as white-knuckling and full of suspense as the other two parts
