a great read for primates of all types i only discovered edgar rice burroughs by accident a couple of years ago when i picked up a copy of this book `` just because '' . it turned out to be far better and far cooler than any expectations i might 've had . if you think you know tarzan and have n't read this , i 've got news for you . you do n't know tarzan . he 's a hundred times more savage and a thousand times more interesting than all those movie versions of the character . he 's also surprisingly complex and sympathetic even as he slaughters nearly everything that crosses his path . i 'm amazed this book was written nearly a hundred years ago . it 's so graphic and unapologetic for tarzan 's bestial nature . that said , there are a few small flaws . elements of the plot can be a bit contrived , but since it usually serves to get to more action , i can forgive that . burroughs 's writing , while still engaging , is a little stilted by today 's standards . and it does n't end with tarzan getting jane . that 's the story of `` the return of tarzan '' . not ending in a book always bugs me . i hate cliffhangers . i do n't need to be blackmailed to read the next one . you can read this book and enjoy it without reading the others . still , even the great edgar rice burroughs loses a star for this flaw because i really hate cliffhangers . sorry , eddie . do yourself a favor and pick this up . it might ruin you for other so-called adventure stories , but it 's worth it
