utterly fascinating this book is so lushly written that you ca n't help but feel as though you are watching these characters ' lives unfold from their kitchen windows . it feels like they are your friends , especially margaret . max is a sweet guy , whose heart is in the right place . edie , i did n't care so much for . the plot twist is surprising , if not a bit humorous with the running joke throughout the novel , and a little far fetched , but it does n't hurt the book in any way . this is a five star read all the way . there are so many little details that minot gives that toy with your emotions . things that a lot of authors would leave out or would n't think of to begin with that really give this book an added realism . i was sad when it ended , but will definitely look for more books from this author
