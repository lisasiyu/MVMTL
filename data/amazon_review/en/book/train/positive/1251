fabulous book what a wonderful book . quite often , a book is real good until the ending , and then i 'm let down , but this has a really good ending too . this tale is really excellent : a verbal piece of art . i liked all the lineage and interconnections in this large musical family . i learned what it 's like to have mucic within you -- to write as well as perform . i liked the character developments -- no one all good or all bad , but all very interesting . i recommend this book highly . one learns about us history , country music , human nature , and it 's entertaining to boot
