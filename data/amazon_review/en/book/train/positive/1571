please read this to your child ! i highly recommend this story to all children . i have a young son who is dyslexic -- the book was recommended to us by his tutor . but as i was reading this i could n't help but feel all children would benefit from hearing it . this book is a wonderful example of how children manage to overcome difficulties . it can also help show children to be more compassionate to those who are less fortunate . it is delightful
