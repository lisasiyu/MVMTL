excellent . it sticks with you for decades . of all of the books that i read when i was a child , this is the only one that i truly never forget . i have captivated the attention of my friends and their children by reciting some of the best verses . the rhyme and meter is exquisite , providing an almost musical theme through each episode . the vocabulary is perfect for young people and fun for adults . it utilizes advanced words , while not burying their meaning from beginning readers . the characters lend themselves to creative new voices for each reader to explore . all of theses remarkable qualities , and it maintains a serious lesson for young people , that guns are not for fooling around
