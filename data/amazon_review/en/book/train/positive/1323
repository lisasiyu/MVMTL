visits from the afterlife i really enjoyed this book ! ! ! it was very interesting to know that your lost loved ones are in fact still here and watching over us and it is also interesting to know how they trancended to the other side . i esspecially enjoyed the part about the celebs and how sylvia browne actually talked to them
