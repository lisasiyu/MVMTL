no one today writes better or writes better stories . beyond the quality of kelton 's stories , especially this one , is the quality of his characters . his leading character , an individualistic , independent , honest and brave rancher , is one of the most admirable people i have ever read about . this was the first kelton book i read , and i became a kelton addict . i have read and re-read this , and highly recommend it . excellent
