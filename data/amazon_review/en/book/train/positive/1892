post modern authentic part way through the book , i paused and thought about these messed-up lives and unexpressed emotions , then it occurred to me that these guys are just like everyone i know . to me , this is why i found the voices so authentic . i am vince 's age and shared his attitude toward those of his father 's generation . there is little narration and much stream of conscious thinking which makes the book , at times , hard to follow . develop a score card of characters and relationships early since it does get confusing . ultimately the four stars are for the implicit language which limits the scope of the book somewhat . although the dialog is onviously authentic , i know that i missed some things since i am not from the neighborhood and the dialog almost assumes that a reader must be from nearby
