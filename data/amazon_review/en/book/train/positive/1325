liberating i 'm updating my review , because i think the first draft was skimpy , and i feel like i have a better view of this book now that more time has passed since my first reading . the crux of the book is guskin 's concept of `` taking it off the page . '' this was extremely valuable to me , and it turned cold readings from being scary to being my favorite part of the acting process ! `` taking it off the page '' is applicable to rehearsals , too , though , and to freshening up ongoing performances . the book lightly touches on a lot of different types of acting : auditions , rehearsals , sit-coms , serials , small roles , big roles , touring , film acting . i think guskin wants to explain briefly what you need to do differently for each of these situations . the book is too short to teach all details for any of these , though , so you will need other sources . the book is very important to me , and my first experience with it was that i read it , and my very next rehearsal was the best rehearsal i had ever had . i felt so free , it was amazing . that is his main objective , to free you up to enjoy and explore .
