very good book this book is terrific . the moves between outland , fairyland , and england are very confusing at first , but once you get the gist of the work it is a very enjoyable ! the way bruno talks is theonly very annoying part . his oos and other such shortenings ( y'reince comes to mind ) are very odd , but he is always followed by a correction by his sister sylvie . all in all , this is an amazing book
