a world of wisdom in one book ! as an author , maeve binchy makes me want to throw in the towel every time i have the privilege of reading one of her books . she is the dickens of our day . no one can bring characters to life , and use a turn of a phrase like her . she is so pointed in her depth of understanding humanity , it 's incredible . i am so glad she chooses to share the gift with her readers rather than just run off with the cash she 's already made . : ) this book is one of her best , with the setting of rossmore being its own true character and all the supporting characters making it a place so real , i want to book a trip now ! bravo to the master ! !
