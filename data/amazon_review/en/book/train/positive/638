worth the read most of the reviews above are political diatribes against keynes and his central conclusion that expanded government involvement is necessary in the economy for stabilization purposes . the key to understanding keynes is the notion that at particular times in the business cycle , an economy can become over-productive ( or under-consumptive ) and thus , a vicious spiral is begun that results in massive layoffs and cuts in production as businesses attempt to equilibrate aggregate supply and demand . thus , full employment is only one of many or multiple macro equilibria . if an economy reaches an underemployment equilibrium , something is necessary to boost or stimulate demand to produce full employment . this something could be business investment but because of the logic and individualist nature of investment decisions , it is unlikely to rapidly restore full employment . keynes logically seizes upon the public budget and gov't . expenditures as the quickest way to restore full employment . borrowing the money to finance the deficit from private households and businesses is a quick , direct way to restore full employment while at the same time , redirecting or siphoning off the funds from the private sector which caused the over-production in the first place . although difficult to read , this book is essential to our understanding of modern economics . far from being destructive , it alone has been responsible for nearly 60 years of growth without a major depression as we experienced worldwide in the 1930 's . i recommend you read this book
