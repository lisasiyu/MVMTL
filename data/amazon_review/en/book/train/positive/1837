short , complex , informative i 'm shocked at the negative reviews this book has received . i found it to be a brilliant introduction to an incredibly complex thinker and person . far from bashing jefferson for his views on blacks and women , appleby apologizes for him , and basically agrees with her negative reviewers here that we should not judge an eighteenth century figure by twentieth century standards . appleby has a remarkable feel for the politics of the early republic , and does a brilliant job of recreating for a modern reader exactly what the federalists and the democratic-republicans were fighting over . she makes a strong case that jefferson stood for democracy , against elitist opponents who sought to exclude common people from voting . the core of her argument is that jeffersonian republicanism is at the heart of our modern conception of democracy , and that both contemporary political parties -- the democratic and the republican -- draw equally on his legacy . an important argument to remember in these partisan times , and it gives us hope that we can overcome our current profound divisions
