interesting outlook on what angels do for ordinary folks . this author always has a unique look at religious views . practical applications and a lot of stories illustrating what the angels have done for folks . no scientifc proof but the author freely and upfront says so . i like this author and have had positive experiences using some of her instructions . if for no other reason her ideas do no harm and are very good for stress and the everyday worries we all have . i enjoy her books and you can read in one gulp or piecemeal and still come away with a different perspective than you started
