yum this wonderful book is not just full of recipes , but full of memories . any cook book can list ingredients and directions , but not all of them also contain stories about the recipes . mrs. small 's crab cakes are delicious and i do n't blame dorothy small for keeping it to herself until the very end . thank you , lari robling and mark thomas
