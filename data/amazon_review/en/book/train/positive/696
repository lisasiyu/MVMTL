a modern masterpiece dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather , the divorce of his parents , and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up , 16-year-old john grady cole heads for mexico with his friend lacey rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen . they find a hard , darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer . cole is scrupulously ethical and strong-willed , and he needs to be . every time he shows love or compassion for another , he is made to suffer for it , and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere . cormac mccarthy 's prose style is challenging at first , but i soon grew accustomed to it . his long galloping sentences effectively emulate the rhythm of travel , and his simple yet often startling turns of phrase bring the landscape of the texas/mexico border region to vivid life .
