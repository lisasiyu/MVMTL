words fail me this is my all-time favorite book from my all-time favorite author . the ending of this book will stay with me forever -- it captures so eloquently the precious fragility of life , of relationships , of family . if you 're looking for action packed melodrama , look elsewhere . but if you 're looking for insight into the day-to-day details of what it is to be human , you 've hit the jackpot here .
