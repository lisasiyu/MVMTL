inspirational for anyone who reads this book i find chuck norris 's story amazing because no matter what anyone else said he worked towards and achieved his goals . an interesting concept of this is how he always shows respect and a smile on his face to everyone he meets , even people who scower at him . he does this because its a proven fact that if you fight someone 's negative attitude with more negativity , nothing will get solved and most likely there will be arguments or maybe even fights . this is one of the many lessons you can learn out of this book , go buy it today . i knew i could learn something out of it and i have learned a lot . i 'm glad i bought this book
