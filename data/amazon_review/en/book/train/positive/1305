great for newlyweds ! ! since i have been married i have fallen in love with my crock-pot ! we both work and it is just the most wonderful thing to come home in the evening and already have dinner ready to go . sometimes it just does n't seem worth the effort to cook for just the two of us , but the crock pot always makes it just so easy . using my crock-pot has saved us so much money by not eating out , and the ingredients that this book calls for are very inexpensive for the most part . it is also much healthier than eating out several nights a week . the best part of this book is that you can always find a recipe that sounds great and you have all the stuff that you need for it in the house . really , all it takes is five minutes in the morning to throw it all in the crock-pot and then you have a great dinner ! i almost always just put the meat in there straight from the freezer and just add an hour or so of cooking time . this would be a great gift for a shower or housewarming . overall , it is a very simple book that always produces tasty and healthy dinners
