refreshing ! i purchased this novel nearly ten years ago . at the time of the purchase , i did not realize that it was a series . so , this book lay gathering dust on my bookshelf , until one day i completely ran out of novels to read . i picked it up , and i was captivated after the first few pages . i did n't want to start the book without reading the ones prior . fortunately , jonathan kellerman is a good enough writer to write a series that does not have to be read in order ! this novel-the clinic-is one of the most fast paced that i 've ever read . i could not put this book down for the life of me . i had to know the who 's , the when 's , why 's , and how 's that were so skillfully placed ! there are so many twists and turns to keep the reader interested , and so much information into the lives of the characters . i recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good novel , especially one that is just as much of a mystery as it is a suspenseful thriller
