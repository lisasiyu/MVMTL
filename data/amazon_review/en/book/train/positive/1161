great book for interested physics students when reading books about chemistry or physics , the level of depth is usually to the electron , proton , neutron , and there is usually some mention of quarks and antimatter and dark matter , but with no explanation of where these ideas are coming from . this book gives a good , nonmathematical description of the standard theory ( model ) of particle physics , which gives a good account of what particles are known , how forces are treated using particles called bosons . the books will answer any questions about what is known , but without proofs . i plan to study physics as an undergrad , and probably grad too , and have always been attracted to learning about the fundamental particles . this book was very satisfying for me , and will be for other interested students . kane provides information about not only the standard theory , but also the facilities where research is done , where the field is going , and what a future student can expect . a quick read and definitely worth the time
