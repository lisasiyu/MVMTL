an engaging and very thorough history of the hope diamond this is a fascinating book ! kurin gives a color and life to the history of the hope diamond , showing the interesting characters and lives touched by the `` curse '' and also those lives that have been positively affected by the diamond . there are photos , paintings , illustrations , and cartoons interspersed in the text to help bring alive the history of the gem . the writing was smooth and accessible and i truly enjoyed the look into history and past cultures as the author brought us on a world and historical tour of the hope diamond
