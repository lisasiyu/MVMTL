excellent application of the mbti to relationship dynamics despite its somewhat maudlin title and front cover , this book is very interesting . it based on jungian mbti theory which in my view is a very powerful tool for understanding people 's personality . the book itself is not theoretical : it gives a brief description of the 16 types and then there is a couple of pages for each of the 136 possible combinations . much has been printed about the mbti , but this one has a very interesting practical approach . for each combination , you find a paragraph on the strengths , a paragraph on the weaknesses , and a short list of key recommendations for each partner . even if you know everything about jungian psychology you can still discover some new insights on personality relationships . for the anecdote , my intj recommendation list ( with my esfj wife ) is a pretty goood summary of everything i do wrong at home
