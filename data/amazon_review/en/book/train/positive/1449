four-year-olds and i find this book delightful . the first time that i read this book was with a group of four-year-olds . they enjoyed it so much that they immediately asked to have it read again . the story and pictures draw one into an imaginative world . the little girl in the story is looking for her stuffed dog , sally , who is lost in the quilt . the squares of the quilt become a wonderful landscape with the little girl calling , & quot ; sally ! & quot ; trying to find her dog . the second time through the story the four-year-olds were calling , & quot ; sally , & quot ; along with me as i read . delightful
