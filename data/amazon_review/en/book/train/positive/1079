for every edgar cayce student i have read 7 of edgar cayce 's books , this is my 8th . i told myself that i would n't read anymore egar cayce books until i 've read his life story . i 'm still reading edgar cayce books after reading , & quot ; there is a river ... & quot ; and now i appreciate his books much more now that i know who the individual is . this book is very in depth , but there are some questions that i have that remain unanswered about his life . perhaps i 'll get more info from the book , & quot ; edgar cayce : an american prophet & quot ; . what i love about mr. cayce is that through the whole book , no matter how much fame he got , or how many people looked up to him , he always stayed humble and close to the bible , which says a lot compared to some psychics that become arrogant just because they have stronger psychic ability than most people . he used his ability not to get rich , but to help people even though he was poor himself . god bless is soul
