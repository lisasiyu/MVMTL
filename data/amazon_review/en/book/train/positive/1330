women is a great , candid , easy to read , crazy book ! ! bukowski writes so well in such an easy to read style that it is hard to put the book down . so i ended up reading this book in about a week . i 'm reading ham on rye now and it 's the same thing , addicting . you ca n't put the darn thing down because you want to see what happens next . he 's like a print version of a reality-show .
