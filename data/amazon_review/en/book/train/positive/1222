a nice little reference the compact size of this book makes it easy to keep handy , and it is full of useful information . some may ( through personal experience ) disagree with parts of it , but it will be invaluable to any new owner as it covers such an array of topics . the easily readable style does n't talk down to you , but is as if you have a friend talking to you . i think it is excellent
