amazing ! this is the first art book i have purchased and i am glad to say it was a wonderful buy . the orientalists is a book full of astounding images and rich prose . the author has written an art book anyone , including a lamen like me , can enjoy reading . how many people actually read books on art , i would venture to guess that most would simply place a book of art on the coffee table and occasionaly glance at it . however , i was unable to put this book down . i found a greater satisfaction in reading orientalists than reading most other books . i learned so much about the rich history of this particular art and strongly reccomend any avid readers to buy this book . you will not regret it ! ! !
