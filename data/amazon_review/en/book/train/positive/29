this one will keep your kids interested ! great book ! we had the 2006 edition for my 7-year-old son last year and he could n't wait to get his hands on the new 2007 . he takes it to school for free reading time and all of the kids love it . even our friend 's 12-year-old says it 's very popular among that age group as well . it 's great because it has something for everyone , is educational , and the sections can be read in short sittings . the cover is almost worn out because he takes it everywhere . we now give this book as gifts all the time
