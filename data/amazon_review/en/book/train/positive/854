helpful and interesting having read and reread this book i feel confident in recommending it to anyone interested in learning to deal with with workplace conflict and cohabitation . the author persuasively and logically argues that most workplace conflict is driven by fears that we may not even be aware of . using the practical strategies put forth in the book has allowed me to gain greater understanding of where fears come from and how to cope with them . this book would be a valuable tool for anyone interested in turning discord into harmony , both at home and at work . the final section of the book suffers slightly from what felt to me like a shift in tone and emphasis . this part of the book seemed to be where the author became concerned with sharing his own personal worldview and therefore might be less useful for the hardcore business reader looking for workplace strategies to implement . that being said , i found this portion of the book to be interesting and enlightening to read simply as a human being and not as a `` business person '' . highly recommended .
