please keep writing i thought this was a very solid follow up to gorky park . the characters lot in life and situation make since to me . the same strong character building comes through to thus book and that dark , a bit desperate feel is there also . i look the feel of the book , in describing the fishing ship - i can smell it , the description is that good . i also liked the story , i was wondering how he was going to give us a fulfilling murder mystery to solve and he did it . if you liked his last book in this series then you will really like this one
