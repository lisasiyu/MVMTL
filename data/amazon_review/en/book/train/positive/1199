a blessing to all reader it takes me a long time to finish this book . i just could not stop going back to the previous chapters , reflected on it and amazed by the insight and spiritual depth of nouwen . i read it in bed times , and in the subway . whenever i go into the lines , my spirit was lifted up high , thanking god who let me know myself and him more . the 3 movements : from loneliness to solitude ; hostility to hospitality ; illusion to prayer are all essential elements of the answer to the question & quot ; how to live a spirit-filled life in the name of jesus christ & quot ; . each sections are as wonderful and unmissable as the others . this book gave me a brand new dimension of understanding on & quot ; christian 's spiritual life & quot ; , on caring and interacting with others and on the nature of our almighty god . i was so impressed that i spent several nights translating around 10 pages in the second part into chinese and read it in my church fellowship . i thank him again and again for leading me to read this
