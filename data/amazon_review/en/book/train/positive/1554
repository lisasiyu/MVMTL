all 13 stories it looks like amazon has taken the reviews of the audio casette set with the same name and put them on this product . there are 13 stories and not 5 as the cassette reviews state . they take up 6 cds . there is one technical flaw . the labeling is wrong on four of the cds . the number is correct ( 1-6 ) but the list of stories on 3 and 5 are swapped and 4 and 6 are swapped . once you solve that mystery things go well . these are short stories and not novels so you should not expect complex plot development or character descriptions . they are a good way to kill half an hour of otherwise wasted time in your life .
