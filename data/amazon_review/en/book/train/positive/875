a must read i love greg iles ! have been a fan since spandau phoenix - mortal fear is iles ' second offering and it is one of my all time favorite books . it deals with computer technology and a computer sex site - and a killer who is using it for his prey . the use of character developement is astounding and the tension is nonstop . for those who like iles , and have n't read his earlier works , this is really a must read - if you are a fan of this genre and have missed this one - you will be thrilled
