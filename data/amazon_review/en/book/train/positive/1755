one of `` bookdom 's '' absolute best reads ! this has got to be one of the most touching and powerful books i have ever read in all my 48 yrs as an avid reader . for anyone who doubts that god takes broken people and makes masterpieces , this is a `` must read '' . to see the hand of god weave these lives together and make a beautiful tapestry was a joy for me . i have very few books that made me cry , but this one evoked every extreme emotion from me . to top all that off , it is a true story . an absolute pleasure and a cherished experience .
