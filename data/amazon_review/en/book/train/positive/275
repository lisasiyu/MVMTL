excellent resource - for traditional weddings this book has been a very good resource for our wedding . however , i have found it lacking in a few areas . it does not have any information on destination weddings . i was also a little disappointed to not find a section on how to tastefully handle a departed parent . overall , this is the best book i have found on the topic of wedding ettiquette and it meshes nicely with emily post 's etiquette .
