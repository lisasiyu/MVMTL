just the text , ma'am this modern library edition runs true to form , lacking much in the way of supplemental material or notes but providing a good basic presentation of the text on quality paper in a good binding . an edition to keep on the shelf for occasional reading rather than a student 's book . if there 's a really good scholarly edition of the `` morte '' out there i do n't know about it - anyone ?
