mystery novel about washington intelligence this 1974 novel used sources like `` the politics of heroin in southeast asia '' by alfred w. mccoy , and the others listed in the 'preface ' . it takes place in washington dc . ronald malcolm works for the `` american literary historical society '' , and reads detective and mystery novels to summarize its plots for his employer . one day their new accountant tells malcolm there is a discrepancy in the records ; of seven crates shipped from seattle only five crates arrived in washington . this had not been noticed previously . the accountant reports this loss in a memo . malcolm reports to work on thursday . it is his turn to go out for sandwiches for lunch , and he uses a basement exit for a short-cut . he also runs an errand . he returns to find the front door locked ; he has to use his key . then he finds that all of his co-workers have been killed by professional assassins . malcolm leaves the building and calls the `` panic number '' from a public phone to report the maximum damage ; he is told to disappear and call back later . when malcolm calls back , he is told to make contact in an alley of a georgetown theater . but his rescue team takes a shot at malcolm , who fires back , escapes , and goes to ground . will malcolm be rescued by he cia or found by the killers ? and who is the double agent ? after you read this novel you can better understand the film , which is a simplified and condensed version ( called `` three days ... ) . the story was changed from drug smuggling ( to censor drug references ? ) , and relocated to ny city . this story seems implausible to me , since eliminating the one link in seattle would avoid the furious investigation that would follow a massacre of seven in washington dc .
