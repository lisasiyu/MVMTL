authentic , delicious italian cooking i love this cookbook ! the recipes are very authentic and the variety is excellent . i make a recipe from this book at least once a week , and i 've had the book for a year . i recently bought a copy for my mother-in-law . i 've had people tell me that my food tastes better than something from an italian restaurant . the recipes do involve a lot of cooking , since most of them use fresh herbs and vegetables . but the quality makes it worth the time ! happy cooking
