academic , funny , balanced it is n't al franken , michael moore , anne coulter or michelle malkin . it 's an objective history , with analysis and some predictions . i 'm a left-wing , liberal , european guy with a decent knowledge of us politcs and i found this book very useful in taking that to the next level . it is definately from the `` economist magazine '' stable , which is good - their pieces are well argued and very easy if your reading age is over 16 . a lot of poeple have found that coming to this book with their preconceptions is n't a bad thing - it is well researched enough and well argued enough to stimulate debate in your mind without lecturing or talking down . they do n't assert one thing or another as correct , but present a timeline and show how fragile the conservative coalition is in reality ( christians , economics , guns , `` values '' etc ) . but argues that even if the coalition fractures the strands of conservatism will remain ( good or bad ) for a long long time to come . w
