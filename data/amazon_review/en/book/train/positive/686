what we know about constraints on population growth obviously , the population of the world has been growing dramatically for the past few centuries . how high can it go ? at how high a level can it be maintained ? what restrictions are placed by the available resources , such as food and water ? this book asks many of the right questions . and it admits that we do n't have all the answers . but it does give some clues about where we may be headed . cohen shows that basically , if we want to support people indefinitely on 3500 kilocalories per day from wheat energy , with 9000 cubic kilometers of annual fresh water supply , well , we can support only 5 billion people . we 're already beyond that . right now , we 're using up resources at an incredible rate . and while the earth could support 10 billion people in theory , it is hard to see how it could do that for long in practice . the author thinks that we 'll never get to the absolute maximum that the earth can support . most people would all be right on the edge of starvation , and we 'd simply be unable and unwilling to stay in that state indefinitely . but i did realize after reading this book that we could stay at about 5 billion people for a very long time if we put our minds to it . standards of living would not be high , but they would be tolerable for the majority , and the ones who found such a life acceptable would keep having children who found it acceptable . those of us who have political views ought to wonder if time is on our side or not . and that is why i think it makes sense to try to imagine what options are available for our mutual future . that 's why i think this book is worth reading
