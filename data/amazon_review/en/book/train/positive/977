a fast paced look at downtown nyc post 9-11 i enjoyed this book . a portrait of an actress trying to search for her place in the world after witnessing the fall of the twin towers . great details for those familiar with the locations and people that make downtown new york its own universe . some names are changed to protect the innocent , but even if you have never ventured south of times square , i believe you will be able to enjoy these characters and their attempts to `` make it '' . a quick read ( i finished this in one sitting and i am not a fast reader ) , fast paced , smart and funny . i am looking forward to reading other books by this author
