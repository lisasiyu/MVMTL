about geography of the area the author of the chapter 1- robert h.heusen is sincere at p.2 saying that other local ethnicities were indigeneous to the area where armenia was established much later-e.g.the khaldeans , the urartians etc . ; that ancient authors wrote about it clearly.i would add that strabo in the ic.wrote in his geography of the world that the armenian political unit was created by a certain general of the army of another country on the land snatched from the iberians/moskhians ; this is in vol 5 of strabo , the loeb classical library edition in 1936 ; this is the area where the republic of armenia was created in 1918.i recently learned that its name was planned to be 'republic of erevan ' ( not armenia ) and the league of the nations promised to the government of kartu i.e . georgia that the creation of armenia in caucasia was a temporary measure-f.nansen from that league of the nations desired to create some footing somewhere in the world for refugees driven out from the balkans and that soon the league of the nations would move the republic of armenia and her armenian and other refugees-unwanted citizens of turkey-to the mediterranean.these facts are known from materials published by f. nansen available in english and some translated into russian now on the web.the creation of that republic and that of azerbaijan in 1918 in the area was the gross violation of the human rights of the indigeneous nation called by several names : the iberians , the moskhians , the kardi etc . r.heusen is absolutely right in telling readers that even before world war i , the armenians were a minority in what became the republic of armenia in 1918.after reading those truthful remarks it was a sad surprise to me to see on the next page `` a map of the historical armenia '' encompassing greater territory than the great britain.r.heusen wrote the former was 238,000 square miles against 228,000 square miles of the latter.the term armenian plateau is frequently used by the author.it is unwelcome as other names were usually used for that plateau.moses khorenatsi is discussed at several pages.it is over two centuries that he is widely denounced for being a fictitious author and therefore called pseudo-moses khorenatsi.i have thoroughly researched materials on that author in publications , in unpublished archives of prof.mikheil tamarashvili known as michele tamarati in rome and paris.many authors in xix century revealed the absurdity of the writings attributed to him : among them mr.lenormann , ilia chavchavadze criticised that pseudo author and his promoters from the mkhitarist congregation in venice- western europe for spreading false information . 'gate of alans ' ( p.152 ) usually has a better term in historical sources : the gate of aragvi.metsamor mentioned at p.49 is the distorted term from kartu term 'metsamuli ' meaning 'cherry colour'-as nearby clyffs are reddish with minerals.this kartu/kartuli designation was given to those clyffs , the nearby village and the river by ethnic kartu population millenia ago before aliens-armenians among them-immigrated to that area-some as refugees , others as invaders accompanying alien armies.authors of this book mention a huge number of writings of persons- including the ancient persians , greeks , romans , kartu ( shota rustaveli , history of kartly , dionysius the areopagite , georgian chronicle ( p.242 ) ; myriad of modern authors and those of xix-xx cc.the book is clearly addressed to modern young ethnic armenians and teach them that they are entitled not only to what was made the republic of armenia in 1918 ( itself an abuse of the human rights of another-indigeneous nation that has created a kingdom including the territory of that area in much early days ) , but to the region'greater than the great britain'.still i give to the authors of this book 'excellent ' , i.e . 5 stars- for excellent misinformation
