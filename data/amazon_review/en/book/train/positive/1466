highly recommended ! written for business executives , this book will help you understand the dynamics between corporate identity and value creation in business . lawrence d. ackerman believes that the true strength of an organization is reflected in its identity , and its ability to use its identity to drive the creation of products and services that provide value to customers . ackerman posits that there should be a cycle between the identity of the company and the profit it generates . the wealth produced by the identity of the organization should feed back into the identity that creates it . the author has outlined a set of guidelines to identify value for the organization . ackerman calls them the laws of identity . for example : 1 . the law of being : `` any organization composed of one or more human beings is alive in its own right , exhibiting distinct physical , mental and emotional capacities that derive from , but do not transcend , the individuals who make up that organization . '' 2 . the law of individuality : `` an organization 's human capacities invariably fuse into a discernible identity that makes that organization unique . '' 3 . the law of constancy : `` identity is fixed , transcending time and place , while its manifestations are constantly changing . ''
