closest thing to founding fathers that we have left these days , you do n't see many people with the interest or guts to do what jon stewart and his co-workers do . in america , the book , they aim to teach misinformed americans what their government is really about . many people do n't actually know what the heck goes on in the government , nor do they care . the book , filled with hilarious tidbits , great explanations , and well thought out presentations , aims to make the government interesting . it 's got history , how the government works , modern day conflicts , theories , ideas , people , and what our founders did for this great nation . it should be a book in every classroom and required reading for every citizen . jon stewart and the authors of this book went out on a limb for this . they went against the grain and did what they knew was right . it 's our duty as americans to criticize the government . when there 's something wrong and you have the ability to fix it , you have the responsibility to fix it . hopefully this has changed america
