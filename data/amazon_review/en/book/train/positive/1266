love of nature grows the more we know i am delighted with this encyclopedia which i ordered as a present for my six year old . this handsome book has beautiful pictures and lots of information covering many aspects of nature . attractive and accessible , it provides great rewards for the young reader whose love and respect of nature will grow as their knowledge expands . i expect it to be used in greater depth as my daughter grows older . for now , she loves to open it up and see what she finds - and becomes engaged immediately . i highly recommend it
