loved it ... i loved this book . the pacing was perfect , the characters well-drawn , and the writing style engaging . mickey haller , the lincoln lawyer of the title , and protagonist , is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his lincolns . he gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker . the author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read . this is the first michael connelly book i 've read , but based on this one , i 'm going back to read his others
