want sk 's scariest short story ever ? look no further ... in this collection of 14 short stories by everyone 's favorite boogeyman stephen king , there is a one particular story in here called `` 1408 '' that is in my honest opinion , the scariest short story that king has published to date . it deals with a haunted hotel room and i 'm not telling you anymore than that . what i will say is that i 've read this one story at least ten times and it never fails to make the hairs on my neck stand straight up . if you , dear amazon shopper , like the feeling of being terrified this is what i suggest : get your hands on a copy of this book . when you 've done that , make sure you save `` 1408 '' for a night that you 're alone . try to read this one when you 're nice and relaxed and really try to let yourself get immersed in king 's masterful storytelling . i guarantee that at least nine out of ten of you that follow my suggestions will get spooked something awful . as for the rest of the book , it really is a return to form for king as far as his short story collections go ( `` nightmares and dreamscapes '' , the book and not the tnt series , was n't all that great save for a couple ) . most of the stories here are hits rather than misses and `` 1408 '' is n't the only story here that will give you the chills . `` the man in the black suit '' is pretty intense ( not to mention king won an o. henry award for that one ) . `` riding the bullet '' , the famed e-book from a few years back is here also , as well as a nice little side tale from the dark tower series titled `` the little sisters of eleuria '' . i recommend this book to the fans and the non-fans alike as this is a great collection . plus , `` 1408 '' is calling
