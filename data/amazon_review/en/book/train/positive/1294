excellent antidote to revisionist history ! this is a marvelous guide book . we intended to visit plymouth on our vacation this year but did not make it . however , we plan to take this book with us when we go next year . dr. jehle goes through all the signifcant sites at plymouth and takes you through the history ( the real history , not the revisionist , politically correct nonesense that passes for history today ) of that site/monument in detail . he acknowledges the contributions of both the pilgrims and the native peoples and highlights the strong faith of our founders as well as that of many of those in the native population . i highly recommend this , especially if you want to teach your children the history of our founding
