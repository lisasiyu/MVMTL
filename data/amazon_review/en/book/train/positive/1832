prophetic visionary this work is a testiment to chester himes ' brilliant insight and characterstic of the schitzophrenic relationship most extremely talented black artists have had with america . much praised for his urban crime series , his more politically charged work was often ignored . this book and the truths it reveals about america 's ability and inclination to create entire groups of people with nothing to lose speaks volumes about today 's society as it did when written by the author . many who read this will be afraid , as well they should . you will be entertained none-the-less , and hopefully inspired to think . the ending leaves something to be desired , i suspect that is because mr. himes was not alive to complete it himself
