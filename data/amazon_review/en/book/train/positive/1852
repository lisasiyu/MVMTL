not a feel good parenting memoir in our house we call somebody like rachel a whineramer . she really knows how to complain . but she writes so well , you do n't care . she had one passage where she describes the ideal ( and unlikeliness ) of the baby bottle coming out of the sterilizer , getting filled and passing to the baby 's mouth without being contaminated . funny stuff . i found the book to be empowering . i felt as a parent , i was just a little better than she was . that is her gift . like jesus , rachel crucifies herself as a crummy mother so that the rest of us can feel ok about ourselves
