`` some people are still water '' . . . being a survivor can be agony . . . alison mcghee 's story is about 17 year-old rose surviving a collision in which she and her older sister , ivy , were innocent victims . rose agonizes throughout ivy 's lengthy hospitalization , and the accident is replayed over & over ; also the mother 's 'coping mechanisms ' - keeping her hands busy while her mind and heart can not allow the release of ivy from the hospital 's life lines . this is a heart-wrenching story , like a movie that must be seen again and again - my reading became skimming at times : i identified rose as a middle-schooler & did n't want her story to tell young girls that sex is a good release from the agony of being alive ; nor is it safe , or without other consequences . ( i was never comfortable about the time our daughters spent on the school bus ! ) mcghee 's characters became a part of my life , not to be sloughed off easily . ( do n't miss her other teen novel , `` snap '' - - also excellent reading for adults . ) reviewer mchaiku agrees with the judges for minnesota 's 2006 book awards that the author 's `` poetic text authentically and movingly reflects the thoughts and actions of a teen who is desperately trying to salvage her life . '' alison mcghee 's writing , and the characters that developed strengths , the quotes which melded to become prime movers for the telling , and the friends who cultivated the writer 's talents - - all are to be admired . ( p.s . : i do wonder why alison mcghee left the adirondacks for minnesota ? ! )
