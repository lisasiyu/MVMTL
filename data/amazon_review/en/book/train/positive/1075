you never know what to expect next this book is probably one of the best pieces of literature i have ever read . the ability of the author to go back and forth between characters seemlessley is impeccable and can never be duplicated by another . the idea behind breakfast of champions is a conflict between two main characters , kilgore trout & dwayne hoover , both with seemingly separate lives and completely different views on life , but once their paths are crossed , their lives change forever . in the beginning , a description of the characters are offered with extensive background information all leading up to their lives at the present and how in some way , shape , or form , they both rely on eachother for sanity . the author then goes even further to describe how their present life predicaments are affecting their outlooks on life and their performence both sexually and mentally are changing with every breath they take . vonnegut goes back and forth between voices , a pious & omniscient figure to becoming either both or one of the main characters , al done seemlessly and impeccably . kilgore trout writes stories that the author comes up with which are then transduced as being sources of porographic ideas and dwayne hoover is a man who is beoming more and more psychotic everyday , he is losing his grip on reality and with the coming of kilgore trout to an art convention that dwayne is also attending , trout 's stories , specifically one about all people being pre-set robots , causes dwayne to snap and go on a rampage harming those who are most closest to him as well as people who need to be harmed , but still have no right to be harmed by dwayne . if anything , this book is a masterpiece and a work of art and i would recommend this book to all whose mind is as twisted and confusing as the author 's , as well as someone who can put up with consistent references to the male genitalia , as grotesque as it might become
