one amazing adventure for a thief the story starts with an introduction to a somewhat cantankerous , yet highly amusing character , gen . he is stuck in jail , having been caught thieving . he bragged about the theft , which is what got him caught . he is taken from prison and told that the king wishes for him to steal something for him that many believe to only be a myth . gen 's only other option is death . so onward the journey goes . he travels with the magus and his two apprentices , ambiades and sophos , plus the admirable soldier , pol . gen is treated as a subservient fool and most times is thought of as nothing but a tool to enact the theft . this viewpoint lends a somewhat snide , yet funny and endearing perspective of the story . i enjoyed watching as the character dynamics changed throughout . plus , on their journey we are introduced to the legends of their gods through campfire stories , which i found a wonderful addition to the story . they added flavor to the history of the lands and gave us an understanding of how the people thought and why they did what they did . i thoroughly enjoyed reading this tale . yes , a worthy read indeed
