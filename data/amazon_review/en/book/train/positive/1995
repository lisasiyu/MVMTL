self reflection i have had this deck for many years now and have not found any better cards to date . they just tell it how it is , simply , without fuss , and without blame . if you do n't want to see your reflection , then do n't look in the mirror ! they articulate human nature exquisitely . mine come everywhere with me . i used them professionally for a few years very sucessfully . i would n't be without them . they are the best friend you could ever have . if you want to develop your better nature/spiritual side , then buy some today . i am not so sure about the enclosed booklet , but i found the book - the secrets of the tarot , a valuable backup . i still see new insights into them even now , and i am sure that i will for years to come
