much-needed history for today 's young women i 'm so glad to see a history for today 's young women about what it was like before title 9 - which , while it was n't that long ago , seems unreal to my daughter 's generation . i remember the days before , when the boys got the gym and were formed into athletic teams while the girls got what passed for pe - calisthenics in the cafeteria ! ( and instructional time was used to move the tables and chairs aside ) in a day when feminism is facing a hostile backlash , ms. blumenthal 's book is a valuable reminder that `` what used to be '' was n't as rosy as some claim , a reminder of the gains made in sports by talented girls , and of what we do n't want to return to ! five stars
