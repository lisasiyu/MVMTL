good , but not one of the better andy carpenter stories a good fun book but not as good as some of the author 's prior efforts . kenny schilling , a football player in an `` o.j . '' type standoff with the cops is accused of murdering another player . he wants andy carpenter to defend him . kenny has no recollection of what happened while the murder took place , just like one of andy 's prior clients ( remember `` open and shut '' ) . andy takes on the case and seems to change his theory as to what transpired almost every 50 pages of the book . hidden in the background of the story is his relationship with laurie , who has an irresistible offer that would involve breaking up with andy . you need to wait till almost the end of the book to find out the outcome ( unless you already had a sneak peak into the author 's next book ) . though the book is better than a lot of courtroom thrillers out there it is slow the first 150-200 pages ( the book is only about 300 pages ) and andy seems to not be as sharp witted and interesting as he was in the author 's prior works . also , the author tries to fake out the reader twice with resolutions but both times there are still a lot of pages to go and so unresolved fine details ( reminiscent of the movie `` taking lives '' ) that the reader is far from fooled . this book should be read but you should start with the author 's first book ( `` open and shut '' ) before getting to it .
