a fine work of literature that can stand alongside any in english i just reread it recently as an adult . i had this boxed set of three hardcover e.b . white books when i was a kid - charlotte 's web , the trumpet of the swan ( which i remember as my favorite of the three , though i hardly remember it today ) , and stuart little . i was so happy when the cheap paperback they ordered here was the same printing - same illustrations and everything . anyway , coming back to it as an adult ( or sort of adult ) was surprising - it was so beautifully laid out , the tone , the story , the dark deep themes - as a short novel , it stands with the best of literature . i know there 's no such thing as a `` perfect '' novel , but as far as any literary criteria can be applied , it is absolutely beautiful - symmetrical in all the right places , gentle as it deals with the harshness of life , all the dark undertones - the sheep in the background with their collective understated cruelty , templeton the amoral hedonist , the cruelty of time that makes little girls grow up - and yet somehow tenderness persists . it 's elegant and real and cosmic and full of quaint americana . certainly not only for children . a fine novel by any standards
