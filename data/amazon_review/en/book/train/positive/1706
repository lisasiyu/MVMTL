zen keys is lifechanging i had always had a semi-interest in buddhism , derived from ecstatic readings of 'dharma bums ' by jack kerouac ( another must-have ) , but disappointed as i couldnt find 'big sur ' at the bookstore a month ago , i chanced upon the religion section , and zen keys shone out on the shelf , i picked it up , read a page of thich nhat hanh 's contemplative prose , and immmediately bought and took it home devouring it in my bedroom for hours . nhat hanhs compassionate and understanding approach to zen buddhism makes learning about it easy , and also very rewarding . his take , which is no ones take at all but rather the truth , about zen makes for free-minded thinking thru the eight negations , mindfullness of everyday life , and the wisdom of the zen masters in the kung-ans at the end of the book . i can not help but be forever changed by this simplistic yet beautiful overlay of zen buddhism . anyone , everyone , americans and materialism and all , must read this , dont lose your life in forgetfullness and apathy and be lost in worldly pursuit , be a monk
