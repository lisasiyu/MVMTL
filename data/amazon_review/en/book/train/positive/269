smart , fun , and pleasingly cynical i 'm at home on bed rest and desperate for something good to read . this book did the trick.. the narrator is smart , funny , and clearly aware that it is next to impossible to do much about most of the evil sleaziness of the world . certainly it is impossible to make changes in individual lives , one at a time . ( or maybe i 'm just jaded , too . some may call it maturity . ) clearly , the narrator is the most decent character in a novel full of morally bankrupt people ( from both sides of the tracks ) . ironically , his career is blindsided due to what others perceive to be questionable morals . anyway , join max as he watches pathetic people with and without class , power , and agency screw up their lives even more than they already have , and help him make sense of it . great literature this ai n't , but a smart , fun , cynical read it is
