a book of epic proportions - literally ! reader beware - 800 plus pages , so this is no book for story time . extremely prolific , james a. michener writes as only he can write about the caribbean , that vast expanse of ocean surrounded by cuba , puerto rico and the extensive small islands smattered across the seascape . this is a powerful history of these islands , and james michener takes us from the 1300s when a peaceful tribe of arawaks are horribly destroyed all the way to castro 's cuba . this is the sort of book one would do better learning about this area from , as the author weaves plot upon plot into a brilliantly masterminded historical novel . you will learn more from this book about the caribbean sea and its islands than any history or geography class could give you , and you will have more fun doing it ! i gave it four stars simply because with a book this size , there was bound to be some dreadfully boring parts , and there were . if it were a bit shorter in length it would lack nothing but a pulitzer
