an excellent devotional for men . as i struggle to renew my faith and walk with the lord jesus , i find this devotional bible an excellent way to start and end the day . it 's comforting how each daily devotion seems to address deeply personal issues regarding my feelings and concerns regarding being a better husband , father , and , most importantly , a better christian . highly recommended
