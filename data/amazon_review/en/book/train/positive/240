excellent introduction to the field for physicists perhaps the best feature of this book is that it aims to convey the theory of lie algebras and lie groups to physicists . in doing so , the author is careful to give a very simplistic approach so that one not familiar with the subject can understand it . not to say that the book is elementary , since it builds rapidly into the far more interesting aspects of lie groups . a very good read
