entry level modeling on max i found this book to be very well written and easy to understand , for the most part the book will take you by the hand in modeling a character ( using 3ds max 3 ) . if you are a total newbie you will find this book easy to comprehend and follow wish in my opinion will set some foundation for you if you wish to buy and read more advanced books on the subject . on the downsize the book does a little attempt to explain texturing a character and does n't go in deep in the process of designing the textures of the characters . but all in all a pretty nice book for entry level character design
