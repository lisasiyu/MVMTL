sweetness ! i am loving this book , but let 's get one thing straight . this is not a cupcake book , as the cover would lead you to believe . in fact , i only saw one reference to a cupcake from a regular layer cake recipe , even though it is written by one of the owners of new york 's famed magnolia bakery , which has gained notoriety for its cupcakes . at any rate , the recipes contained in this book are pure magic . so far i have made the white layer cake with chocolate chips and peanut butter icing ( as suggested ) , and it was quite a hit with friends and family . other recipes i 'm going to try in the next few days are the sour cream coffee cake and the buttercup golden layer cake . this book is all about making things from scratch like they did in the olden days , but you could also mix and match homemade cakes with store-bought icing or vice-versa . read the introductory section with tips and pay attention to the details ( e.g. , use cake flour instead of all-purpose or self-rising , use butter/sour cream at room temp. , etc . ) , which will make all the difference . the section with icing recipes is short but covers a variety of flavors . it 's definitely not an atkins-friendly cookbook or any of that , so you know it 's good for your sweet tooth ! i would definitely recommend this book to any baker , novice or expert , and am looking forward to buying 'the magnolia bakery cookbook ' ( co-authored by appel ) next
