unconceivable story , but an amazing piece of literary work ! the partner has quite an outrageous story line , but the way in which grisham tells the story is absolutely amazing : starting with the climax , grisham leaves the reader confused and uncertain on his or her feelings for certain characters ; as he works backwards telling the story leading up to the climax through events in the present , all the pieces fall into place and the confusing events and feelings in the beginning now make perfect sense . yet another great novel from john grisham
