excellent - very well written this book brought both tears and empathy to myself and everyone else who suffers intense and real depression - to hear someone so eloquently describe the various chapters and measures of depression ( `` suicide , etc '' ) - this is an enormous and life work of incredible literature and an accountancy of the horrors and nature of depression . i highly recommend this book to anyone suffering the very darkness of depression - which i can not describe , yet this author does an incredible job of doing such - to those dealing with those they love working though and understanding depression . highly , highly recommended . i can not accolade this book or write enough to express my gratitude and comfort ( in hearing/knowing of others - including the author ) of other 's darkenss which we label as `` depression '' -- i just wish i was as good an author or writer as this ; i am in amazement in the manner which the author has explained the nature of melancholy -- depression -- and the darkness which it covers
