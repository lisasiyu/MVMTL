folksy but conducive of thought crystallization i found this book unsatisfactorily casual and slap-happy for the work of putative been-there-done-that expert with such lengthy tenure in and around things ufological . yet , by reading this , i did manage to concretize a philosophical system that has been emerging for years as i read one ufo book after another -- while also reading widely in other things paranormal , as well as a spate of less abstract fields , such as history , science , linguistics , anthropology , and such . let us posit that aliens ( 1 ) exist ; ( 2 ) have the technology to visit remote star systems ; and ( 3 ) took greatly enhanced interest in earth only when it developed weapons systems capable of either harming other civilizations ( i.e. , in combination with its rocket technology ) or of destroying itself ( which would constitute a crying shame from the viewpoint of fundamentally beneficent aliens who respect other sentient life forms ) . keyhoe leads me to believe -- amid his conspiratorial musings and his subtle hints at what was meant by what was really meant by what mr. x thought that mr. y intended -- that they are watching us and executing a hands-off policy until such time that we pose a direct , immediate danger to ourselves ( this will occur long before we pose a direct and immediate danger to exocivilizations ) , at which time -- starfleet-style `` prime directives '' od non-interference notwithstanding -- they will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the harmonious continuation of our culture . whether that means utterly conquering and enslaving us , or surreptitiously seizing control over certain key organs of our governments ( possibly to include forging certain elements of the whole-earth government whose existence einstein endorsed as a logical and necessary eventuality ) , or just providing cultural `` guidance counselors , '' who can really say . it is indeed food for thought to ponder the likely -- well , the possible -- archetypal alien ethos and surmise what it might intend for us and why it should , or will , occur when the time requires it
