5 stars are not enough ! this is surely one of the greatest collections of 'linked short-stories ' ever written -- it matches calvino 's cosmicomics and borges ' labyrinths . lem is a total genius . a writer of playful little fables that are also philosophically profound ( and logically consistent ) . this book is a brilliant companion to lem 's the cyberiad , with which it shares many themes and ideas . lem has a beautiful style : he can make engineering terms sound poetic . his rigorously modern metaphors are as original as those of j.g . ballard , but more varied and lyrical . for lem , the periodic table is an unwritten poem . this book is the final and true ode , and each line is a fantastic , fabulous , incredible story . i give this book 200,000,000 stars . and that 's only because i 'm not feeling so generous today . it probably deserves a googolplex ( 1 to the power of 100 raised to the power of 1 to the power of 100 ) of stars . at least
