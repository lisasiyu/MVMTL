no stuffed puppy here protagonist donna trenton sure is in hot water , or should hot weather be more appropriate . as if being trapped in a dead pinto with a sick child in the middle of summer while a mean dog surveys the vehicle is n't enough ... but when the mumbo jumbo beast happens to be inflicted with rage on top of that , you can safely say that , besides being toasted in many ways , this lady definitely should have stayed in bed that faithful morning . but , alas , like in any stephen king novel , one has to pay the price , and since woman adultery is the case here , poor donna has a lot to chew on , to say the least . writing in a alcoholic stupor ( as stated himself ) clearly does n't stop king from delivering an effective read . indeed , cujo is gutso with lots of blood , excitement and canine hair . its first half may be in neutral mode with its character development and action setting , but when the gear is shifted , watch out . driven to despair has never been more fun in the hand of this maine man . cloned perhaps in its `` jaws '' bite , cujo is nonetheless pure king when it comes to compelling plot . just like its saint-bernard creature , the author clearly knows how to deliver the goods with drooling edge of your seat moments and in-your face action prose . yes , the novel aims for the bubble gum crowd but what a flavorful load of fun this one is -- enough to hail it worthy of a sleep-depraved moment award , for sure . enjoy. -- -- -martin boucher
