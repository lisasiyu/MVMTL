excellent book for those looking for hope i read this book several years ago and it has been very importan not only in my personal growth as well as being a book i highly recommend for my clients . borysenko 's ability to write in a profound meaning manner , while not resorting to technical language.. makes this and other books by her accessible for laymen . if you would like to find a light out of the & quot ; dark nights of the soul & quot ; , this is the book to read
