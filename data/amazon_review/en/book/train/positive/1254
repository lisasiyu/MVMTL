enlightening description of immigration and languages i started reading this wonderful book 6 months before i left brazil towards israel . after finishing the first part ( paradise ) i just could not keep on reading , and i abandoned the book for a while . after i landed in israel i re-took the book and was delighted again with the realness of it . a thought occurred to me that the reading was so descriptive of the immigration sentiment that i just could not understand it before immigrating myself . the book helped me to understand and to organize the infinite sensations that come with the leaving/arriving to another country . how the language affects the way we think and act , how sadness and happiness are mingled into one strange feeling , how we cope and forget without noticing , and how we urge to succeed and prove that we can be part of the new country . in addition , the book also brought to me new feelings and curiosities about my grandparents , whom also escaped from poland and russia in the late 40 's . hoffman describes so well how the old traditions and languages influenced the new live of those who left their country because of prejudice and persecution ! one passage that i am specially fond of : `` no , i 'm no patriot , nor was i ever allowed to be . and yet , the country of my childhood lives within me with a primacy that is a form of love . ( ... ) all it has given me is the world , but that is enough . it has fed me language , perceptions , sounds , the human kind . it has given me the colors and the furrows of reality , my first loves . the absoluteness of those loves can never be recaptured : no geometry of the landscape , no haze in the air , will live in us as intensely as the landscapes that we saw as the first , and to which we gave ourselves wholly , without reservations . '' it reminds me of wordsworth when he writes about tintern abbey . a wonderful life-changing book .
