solid crime/mystery/suspense unlike the first repairman jack adventure , the tomb , which was horror/science fiction , this one is a straight mystery . wilson does try his best to shamelessly tug at your heartstrings , tossing in some abandoned babies with aids , and also some child pornography . add a modern-day japanese samuri , some american mercenaries , some arab villains , and you 've got is a fast-paced novel that could be made into a pretty good movie
