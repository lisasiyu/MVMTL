systematic theology is an outstanding theological work to be quite frank with you , i was simply going to come online and recommend that you do not buy the abridged version , but make certain that you are getting the full , unabridged 4 volume set . however , i was surprised at reading one review which makes a comparison to monty python . that reviewer also suggested that chafer 's approach was for a believer to check their mind at the door of a church before entering . i must admit , i have no idea where this person is coming from . chafer has one of the most careful , logical and systematic approaches to theology that i have ever read ( and i have a huge library ) . i know of several pastors whose ministry was changed profoundly because of this one book . there is nothing anti-intellectual about chafer 's approach ; there is nothing which is dumbed-down . bear in mind , this is a 4 volume set . my abridged version is about 1000 pages . in particular , chafer 's approach to the angelic conflict is exemplary . i have only one criticism , and that is with the abridged version : somethimes , a point will be made which is true , but the scripture quoted is not directly on point . i do not know if that is the fault of chafer or the fault of the abridged text . my recommendation is , if you are going to own just one book ( or set of books ) which cover nearly the entire realm of doctrine , this should be it .
