very good book for security policy enablers and admins this is one of the few books that i have come across that focuses mainly on the innards of security assessments . the services based security and counter measures are helpful for threat modeling . this book is really great for people in the security risk and threat analysis for a quantitative and qualitative validation . good book to help in setting up corporate security policy model . other people have already provided a good chapter wise run-down so i will skip that here ... buy this book : )
