a successor to dorothy parker ? fran lebowitz is sometimes referred to as the successor to dorothy parker . a few similarities are apparent . both are sharp-witted , female new yorkers famous for their often stinging one-liners . yet , if parker could be considered a painter of the urban american landscape in the 1920s through 1950s , lebowitz should be considered a sketch artist from the 1970s . i do n't think she has parker 's depth or sense of structure . her essays are playful but often amount to mere list making or an assemblage of loosely connected observations that could just as well belong on a greeting card or cocktail napkin . and she often relies way too heavily on puns . several pieces in this collection fall flat for me . yet others - such as her advice to heiresses , `` at home with pope ron , '' and `` the last laugh '' - were quite clever . i think she 's worth reading as perhaps one of the leading humorists of her generation . comparisons with the more versatile and compelling parker are a bit of a stretch , though
