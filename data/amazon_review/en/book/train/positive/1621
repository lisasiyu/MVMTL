three stories in one book . the cranky day is made up of three stories : cranky bugs , put-upon percy , and lady hatt 's birthday party . this inexpensive paperback is perfect for the thomas fan . it has the colorful photographic `` illustrations '' that look like the series we 're familiar with . this one is really popular with my thomas fans , and you can read the stories one at a time or all three at once . but beware -- when you 're finished they 're going to want you to read it again ! and again ! and again
