hunwick 's egg a wonderful story of devotion ! mem fox continues to be one of my favorite children 's story tellers . hunwick is a sweet little creature who remains loyal in spite of others ' misgivings . the use of so many animals strange to the americas makes the book even more wonderful , with delightful pictures to help with the story
