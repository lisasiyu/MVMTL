cinema 4d 9.5 excellent ! well written , easy to follow . this book has provided me with a hands on guid that i have search for many years . i am new to animation , and i think mr. mitchell did a fantastic job of explaining and making his real world application easy to follow . this book has taught me more about professional animation than any other books in my library . to me the cd is an added bonus . i would highly recommend this book to any beginner who is trying learn 3d animation production . the only negative thing i have to say is , why it took you so long to publish a book that gave someone like me the confidence in learning 3d animation . i was able to create my first animated characters by using this book , by adding this book to your library , you will be gaining a wealth of knowledge . by the way , when is your next book coming out ? simply , this book is great
