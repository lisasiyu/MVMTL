yes , stephen king really is that good there was a time when stephen king was one of my favorite authors . then i started hanging out with a better class of authors , hehe . but now , he is once again one of my favorite authors . as i said before , he 's raised his game . on writing and everything after . if it 's a re-issue of an oldie , well , it has a new introduction by the guy who wrote on writing , and that alone makes it worth buying again . truly , i love every word he 's published for the past five years . the guy was already ( perhaps ) the best seller of all time , and he was n't satisfied . how great is that ? what we have here is a collection of 14 short stories , some just creepy/scary and others literary . it 's a wonderful mix of what we 've always known he excels at and what we may not have realized he excels at . several months back , i heard some scary rumors to the effect that he might retire . that is not allowed . stephen , if you retire , i 'm gon na round up annie wilkes and we 're gon na make you shave picasso 's neck . so there !
