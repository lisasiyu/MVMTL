i feel there is something missing the book provides a basic description on the subject supported by real-life stories about indigo children and situations of parents of indigo children . i liked the descriptions written on dealing with indigo education and the integration with alternative therapies and activation of energies and meditation . lee carroll needs to explain more on dealing with indigos , and how-to 's . i am sure another book will soon come up that will be more in - depth on indigo issues , especilally for us , the indigo adults and it would be great to have more on not only family relationships between indigos and others , but other types of relationships as well . how to make life easier for those around indigos , and the other way around .
