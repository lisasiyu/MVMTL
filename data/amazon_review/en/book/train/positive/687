one of the best dog stories i have ever read willie morris was a truly great author ! this story of his childhood with his dog was really heartwarming . it is so simple and warm and humorous , you will just love it . warning : you will cry your eyes out at the end , but it 's worth the pain . one of the best animal stories ever , i hope many kids read this in school . if you loved the movie `` a christmas story '' you will love this book . the movie version of `` my dog skip '' is also quite good , though it is kind of upsetting that in order to create drama the wonderful father of the book is kind of nasty in the movie . willie morris was a great author who also wrote a cat book entitled `` my cat spit mcgee '' and several books about his life that remind me a little of russel baker 's memoirs . one is entitled `` north toward home '' , another `` good old boy '' and one is about life in new york city .
