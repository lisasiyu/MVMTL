concise and precise this concise introduction to critical thinking presents rules for clear thinking , valid communications , and creating and assessing persuasive arguments . its 87 brief pages are readily accessible to high school students , and useful to anyone interested in offering correct evidence and valid reasons to support conclusions . when so much of what we read , hear , and see is intended to persuade us , or even mislead us , it is important to distinguish valid arguments from careless or manipulative ones . if good writing is clear thinking made visible , then this book provides excellent advice for writers . as a rulebook , it begins by presenting 30 rules for clearly constructing a valid case supporting your conclusion . it then turns to applying these rules for writing argumentative essays . it also treats fallacies and includes an appendix on correct use of definitions . the author recognizes this book is only an introduction to these topics and provides a good list of further reading . fallacies are seductive and often go unnoticed and unchallenged . in this book , many fallacies are described alongside the rules they violate . a short chapter then names and briefly describes many types of fallacies . i would have liked to see this expanded . we have long recognized sexist and racist language and work to purge it from use . i look forward to a time when a broader set of fallacies will be routinely recognized and corrected in everyday conversation . perhaps then it will be common to interrupt the speaker to say something like : `` excuse me , but you just used the fallacy of modus ponens by affirming the consequent . please correct that logic error before proceeding .
