challaging and deep reading first of all , i would like to say in my behalf that i 'm no logic expert , and that i had to cut popper 's book in chapter 8 just to read an introduction to logic before i continue further in my personal experience with popper . this book is a classical one , i had just seen references to it before , so i decided to give it a try . boy , i was so out of my territory i felt really confused at times , but finally manage to get through the technical issues . this was a hard reading book for me , but i do n't regret the month i devote to it , all the effort was worth it . so , why do i gave it four stars then ? well , just because it was hard , sorry , i do n't have a better argument , but it 's true , if you do n't poses a solid background in logic this would be a hard reading . i 'm not going to talk much about this book content since i do n't like that much , and everybody seems to do that , there 's even some really good reviews in this page that make a better job that the one i could . finally i will like to say that if you are interested in the philosophy behind scientific work , this is a wonderful book
