an engineer 's view this book was chosen as one of the books to be read and discussed by my men 's book club . the author 's treatment of the creation is absolutely spell binding and very convincing to an engineer . the way in which the author finds god 's face in so many things is interesting and absorbing . i had trouble putting it down , it reads so easily
