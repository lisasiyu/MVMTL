a voice for those who do not have a say right now . promises made are not always promises kept . we all say that we want education to be a priority for all . do we all really support that ? the shame of the nation exposes the compliancy that many americans have when it comes to actually promoting equal opportunities for all . we want our professional athletes and olympic contestants to be able to compete and train in the best facilities and with the best practices . this enables them to reach their fullest potential and beyond . we should all be willing to support this endeavor for the education of all of our students . this book helps us to walk in another 's shoes and truly empathize with the inequaties that so many children must deal with . reading this book should open ones eyes to how many future adult american are set up for failure . brown vs. board of education may have imposed laws for equality but it must go further into the mindset of funding agencies . if we are truly to become equal , we must alleviate the barriers that cause the fragmentation of opporutnity and success . educators want the opporutnity to teach and have the necessary materials and support to do so . administrators want the same . the educators and students make the best out of what is given to them . if limited resources are available and offered , how can we expect teachers and students to excel . policy makers and politians must make an effort to walk in another 's shoes . making the educational needs of all of our student 's a priority must be at the front of the list . these are future americans . the pride and ownership that we instill and facilitate in our young americans will carry us on for years to come .
