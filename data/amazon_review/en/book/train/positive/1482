a new classic for years to come `` do n't play in the sun '' by marita golden ***5 stars this is a very disturbing subject , especially if you are lightskinned like me . luckily , marita golden handles it with a lot of tenderness and care for others . i liked marita golden 's book more than the color complex , because her life story gave it a specially intimate dimension . i would recommend this along with anything by kola boof , an ethiopian author who has really been bringing this subject up in ways that literally stop the blood in your veins . her novel `` flesh and the devil '' breaks this issue down but it 's not for the squeamish . she 's like hardcore compared to marita golden and most authors i 've read . i 'm going to read `` the bluest eye '' next . `` do n't play in the sun '' is a new classic . people will be reading this for years .
