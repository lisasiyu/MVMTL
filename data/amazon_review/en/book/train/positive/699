an unabashed love letter to liberals & the democratic traditions i read this book in the audio form against my will for a political book club . i thought to myself , `` oh great ! another liberal tome , telling us liberals how we went wrong and how we need to learn to strategize . blau blau blau ... '' instead , i was transported into an america of my dreams , lovingly cradled by mr. reich 's comforting and hopeful vision of america . possessed with a masterful narrating voice , mr. reich connects the reader to our rich , democratic traditions and applies these tried and true values to our current problems . he makes it sound so easy ... . i found myself wishing that he was our president . when i told this to a friend of mine , she noted that `` he 's probably too short . '' i did n't give it 5 stars because i did n't agree with some of his views on globalism and i thought he was a little too pollyannaish for these times . if our elected officials would just sit down , read this , and follow the instructions , america would look more like the america that we all claim that it is . hopefully , some future president will have this wise and wonderful man on his or her side in the whitehouse again .
