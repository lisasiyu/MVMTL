my side of the mountain the book i read is a pretty fun book ! the book my side of the mountain by jean craighead george is a book where a boy runs away from the city to the mountains . he finds out how to live . later he gets a pet falcon and names it frightful . soon he finds a man , but he thinks he 's a bandit , then he becomes friends with the man . the boy , sam , finds out he 's a professor . he 's good at making jam too . before the winter he has halloween with the animal friends he has made , and invites them to his house inside a tree , but it does n't turn out well after the party . sam kills some deer and rabbit to make clothes for the winter . he wears the rabbit 's fur as underwear because it 's waterproof . after the winter his parents and sister come to visit him , but they are going to live in a cabin instead of his tree house , so he gets angry but later calms down . i think the writer wants the reader to try running away . i like it because i think i would try running away in the mountains to see what happens . i highly recommend this book for both parents and kids to read .
