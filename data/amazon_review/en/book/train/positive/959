love this book ... am rereading for 10th time ! ! right now i 'm rereading karen rose 's have you seen her ? it 's romantic suspense at it 's best , with a dark overtone . sbi agent steven thatcher ( who was introduced in earlier books ) is floundering . he has a case that involves young teenage girls that go missing from their beds . and they 're turning up dead , and noone seems to know anything . according to the feedback he 's getting , these girls would never have willingly left their homes with anyone . he 's hitting a wall , and more girls are going missing ... his home life is quickly spiralling out of his control , too ... his 17 year old son is suddenly flunking classes in school , sullen and sneaky ... his youngest son , who was kidnapped in a previous book , still wo n't sleep in his own bed and is just getting so he 'll allow himself to be touched again ... and steven 's aunt is determined to fix him up with a woman . in the midst of all this , steven meets jenna marshall . dr. jenna marshall , actually~~his 17 yr. old son 's chemistry teacher , who is very concerned with brads decline in grades and attitude . the attraction is mutual , and immediate . but how will steven find the time for this when his plate is already full ? this is an awesome story , and if you 're a romance fan , or a fan of suspense , do n't miss it ! ! it 's loosely connected to karen 's other books , but every one is stand alone and not to be missed . her new book , count to ten is due out soon , and i ca n't wait ! !
