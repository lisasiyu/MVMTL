did anyone else notice the bagavad gita connection ? having read the bagavad gita , it only much later dawned on me that carlos is arjuna and don juan is krishna - only the wisdom is completely different . but in the gita we have arjuna who has an ordinary mind and not much bravery at all who yet faces the fact that he has to make a rite of passage which seemingly involves summoning courage to fight an all-inclussive family feud , but becomes something far more spiritualmysticalmetaphysical as he keeps balking at krisna 's encouragement to go through with the pasage . arjuna keeps telling krishna he does n't understand a word krishna said and krishna patiently launches into another in-depth explanation - and it is evident that in order for krishna to fully express the wisdom , spirituality and higher truth of the cosmos , it is necessary for arjuna to not get him and to be continually the baffled coward , hopeless to ever attain gravitational escape velocity , and always planted at square one while krishna patiently and lovingly imparts the esoteric wonders - like one of those books - `` karma for the complete idiot '' .castaneda seems to have applied the same schematic - whether knowingly or not - to spoonfeed the don juanisms to the reader . and they are truly profound - they 're too heavy to be something castaneda just sat at his writing table whipping up out of whole cloth ! castaneda did his research and it 's the power of the don juan `` nuggets '' that make the books truly transcendent and generous in their magic - which is contagious to a reader ! that said , however , i got the feeling that castaneda was , by the 4th or 5th volume , really starting to spin his wheels and using more effort than content to take us to the next level . castaneda has done a great service in giving humanity some cracks to fall through in our supposed finite and material trappings . and so has the bagavad gita
