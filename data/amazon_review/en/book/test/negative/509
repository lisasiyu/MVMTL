lost credability , quickly ! ! i admit , i have n't finished this book . a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia . i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards , interest in astrology and angels . granted , i am not a firm believer in just `` the hard facts '' but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !
