thayer is no longer relevant . but ... thayer went great lengths to produce an excellent lexical resource . many would agree . but shortly after publishing , his book became outdated . koine greek was no longer viewed as a holy spirit invention ( which was thought for a long time since scholars could not find 10 % of the nt vocabulary in secular writings until about the last century ) . since thayer 's release , koine lexicography has taken great strides and has since left this dictionary far behind ( see `` greek grammar beyond the basics '' by daniel b. wallace ) . one positive of thayer 's dictionary is his study of etymology . understanding how words form is very helpful in vocabulary memorization . but i 'll add a word of caution illustrated by this short etymology lesson : `` butterfly '' does not mean `` a fly made of butter . '' as words evolve ( or devolve ) , they do not always retain their meanings . koine vocabulary is an example that has been required to simplify in order to be accepted by various cultures . the words will not always fit etymological patterns or classical definitions . why then is thayer 's still so popular ? it 's cheap . it 's public domain . and it 's easy to use . purchase at your own risk . recommended : `` a greek-english lexicon of the new testament and other early christian literature '' by walter bauer , frederick william danker ( editor
