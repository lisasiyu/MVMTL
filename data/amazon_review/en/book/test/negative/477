a critical indictment of high school history texts james loewen 's `` lies '' is a valuable tool , debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions . where this critcal work fails , though , is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm american institutions . loewen 's praise of a figure like john brown does nothing to further this end . i do not believe , as the author does , that history as taught today is propaganda , but i do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose , and this being a capitalistic society , they are also written for consumers . i am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of christopher columbus bashing . it serves no interests to villify columbus in the name of historical accuracy . all who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity . loewen rails on about the `` exploitative '' element in columbus 's story , but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for african discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination . similarly , his accusation of lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present . it is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined . both the author and i agree that history is written by the victors , so why does loewen rehash this ad nausem ? loewen asks the question , `` how is one supposed to feel about the america that has been presented ? '' my answer after reading his book is , overwhelmingly negative and cynical . his criticism of texts , as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies , must be taken into account in teaching history , but his negative tone must be balanced . students do need to become , in loewen 's words , `` crap detectors . '' students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions , on that much i think we would agree
