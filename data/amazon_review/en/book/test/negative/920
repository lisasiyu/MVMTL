i would not buy this . speaking as someone who has been both fat and thin in my life i can honestly say this book did nothing for me . i do believe that all women are beautiful and we all should love our bodies . however , i do n't think this book gets that message across ! it sounds like the person who wrote this is no expert and is angry because she looks the way she does , failed to find a solution and is looking to tell the world how we should think and what we should find attractive . besides that , it 's kind of a one-sided book and repetitive . also , i beg anyone claiming that being fat is healthy to look at the statistics again . close to 60 % of people in america are overweight , possibly more . this includes children . we are far bigger than we were 100 years ago and ingest far larger portions of food . heart attacks are killing more and more people and it 's victims are getting younger , sometimes even children and people under 30 years old . sure , some people can be fat and healthy but those cases are so rare they are certainly not the majority . i do agree that pushing images of too-skinny supermodels is a bad thing but i do n't think pushing overweight models would be any better . if you are overweight and looking to feel better about yourself , you might like this book . if you are like me and actually did something about the things you disliked , this will sound like a really whiny , excuse filled , negitive book . yes , i work out to be healthy . yeah looking better is a nice feeling but certainly not as important as how i feel . no , i do n't want to look like a supermodel . i loved my body fat and i love it now , that 's why i lost the weight to begin with . i want to live as long as i can in this body and feel the best i can instead of feeling slow , tired and heavy like i used be . i feel much better , my chronic foot pain went away and i have lots more energy . i work out 5 days per week and make a good living teaching others to be healthier too . this book does nothing to help people in the long run , it 's just someone 's angry rant about their warped perspective ! being obese is n't healthy and that 's why people think it looks ugly , it 's not because we are a brainwashed , shallow society ! and no , being fat is not a fate worse than death , it is death and kills millions of people every year !
