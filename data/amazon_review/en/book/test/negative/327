the old feint and switch so you pick up this book and read on the back cover the exciting quote about hemingway 's ghost and you 're ready to drop some cash , right ? guess what -- there 's zero information about the hemingway haunting in this book ! in addition , old ataulfo of madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic 's version of handel 's halleluja chorus . instead , what 's offered here is a rehash of old stories ( and old theories about what ghosts could be ) with insipid , comic book illustrations . why this is called a & quot ; field guide & quot ; with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon -- be it birds , plants , or mushrooms -- is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists . if you 're a serious researcher of this subject , then pass this book up and seek hem 's fetch elsewhere
