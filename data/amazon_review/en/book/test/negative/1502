pretty but useless it looks cute ( like martha stewart 's magazines ) but did not contain one usefull piece of advice . since most of us only do this once , there is not too much personal experience to draw from . therefore we look to the professionals for ideas , sample wording and help . this was total waste of time unless i was going to have each invitation hand written or tied with a rhinestone buckle
