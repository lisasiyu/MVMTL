disappointing peter falk 's book was nothing but a few stories . he only talks about a few columbo episodes , he is so brief and uninteresting . also , he talks about his buddies too much . who cares about john cassavetes ! he talks like he 's some filmmaking genius . if you want to read about peter falk and his life as an actor , it 's sadly left out . he does n't even talk about how he met his wives . sadly , a very dissappointing book . not recommended !
