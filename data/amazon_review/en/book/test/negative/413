not recommended , especially considering the much superior alternatives i was quite disappointed with ballast 's graphic division review . not only is the book itself sloppily laid out , and quite incomplete in regard to the information provided within it , there are much better alternatives out there . norman dorf 's `` solutions '' guide is a much better preparation guide , one that i wholeheartedly recommend to anybody about to tackle the are graphic exams
