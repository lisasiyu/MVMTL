not age appropriate . shocking . i purchased this for my 11 year old son . i am so thankful that i read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it . the pictures are hand drawn but graphic . far too much detail for the target audience . kids need to know about sexuality but they do n't need to know everything before they are even teen-agers . i would be upset to find this in a school library . this book definitely needs to be used with supervision . i returned this book as i believe its content is inappropriate for the cover advertised age of 10 years old .
