misinterperation of jihad first of all , i think that anyone out there who is writing books about anti islam are just out there to make money . i would like to go back to what the author stated about the muslim world dictators . the question is who put them in power to eliminate the true values of islam ? why today middle east is the target by the oppressors of the new world order ? who puts these leaders in throne and try to bring democracy to a muslim world . what would happen if islamic constitution would establish in western world . it would be a scary scene for that part of the world . those who are muslims or studied islam knows that it is a religion of peace . the word jihad in islam corresponds to fighting against the devil who resides within all of us which is 90 % of jihad and the other 10 % of jihad is self defence . there is no conflict among any religion branch except those power hungry dictators . comon people lets not have a religious war , we are all the children of adam and beleive in one god . let us all join together to fight the devil who is here to destroy each individual of us . we must all wake up before it is too late and see what the soldiers of devil are doing to bring one world order and to enslave us under the devil government . peace to you all
