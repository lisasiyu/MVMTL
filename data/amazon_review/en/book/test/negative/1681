disappointing it has nothing but pre-published photos we have all seen before in magazines . the tats are n't even shown . they talk about how angelina has a lot of them but they do n't even list them all . not made for the true tattoo enthusist . a coffee table book at best . it describes their crazy childhoods more than the tats
