yecch ... i picked this book up because i was running out of decent mystery novels , and figured i was primed to love it given my obsession with the outdoors as well as mysteries . it only gets two stars because i actually made it through . and i only got through it because i had nothing else to read . i know nevada barr is a `` name , '' and judging by the number of her books stocked in my local bookstore , a popular one . but i could list the things that are wrong with her writing for ... well , let 's just say more space than amazon is going to give me for this review . her prose is bad . her imagery is unlively ( and if you 're going to write about a landscape like anna pigeon 's , you sure as hell ought to be able to write it ) . her characters range from the merely flat to the utterly ridiculous ( anna 's romantic progression through this book : `` oh , i am widowed and my life will never be the same without my husband '' to `` oh , it might be fun to be a lesbian '' [ an out-of-the-blue idea the author never bothers to resolve ] to `` let me have a fling with this random man , who , by the way , has as much character as a cardboard cut-out '' ) . worst of all , she cheats . i guess mystery writers do n't have an official code , but according to the dorothy l sayers model , thou shalt not give the detective clues not given to the reader . a mystery novel is no fun if the puzzle is n't there for you too . of course , if nevada barr had given us all the evidence she gives anna pigeon , there would n't be a mystery to have a novel about . her cheating merely covers up her inability to produce an engaging and puzzling plot . this was a pathetically sub-par book for the amount of attention it and its sequels have received . if you 're looking for an amazing female detective , check out laurie r king 's two series , one about sherlock holmes ' feminist partner mary russell ( as unlikely as it sounds , and more than good enough to make up for it ) , and the other about san francisco cop kate martinelli . if you want a book about living in the desert , i 'd suggest edward abbey 's _desert solitaire_ ( it even has a brief appearance by a dead body ) , or his hilarious eco-terrorist adventure _the monkey wrench gang_ . anything but this
