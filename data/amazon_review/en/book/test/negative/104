worthless i had great hope -- sleep ! ! ! ! ! ! but it is just yet another book advocating abuse of the child for the ease of the parent . yes , i want sleep . no i will not sacfice my baby 's secure attachment to me , and faith in me and the world to get it . crying it out is abuse pure and simply . do n't waest your time and money -- if you think this is how to raise a child , do yourfelf and the child a favor and giv the child to someone who will care .
