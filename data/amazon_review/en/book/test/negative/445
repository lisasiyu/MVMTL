ramblings of a dirty old man . heinlein is a great author . when he sits back and tells a story , he 's one of the best . glory road and citizen of the galaxy are wonderful , and the moon is a harsh mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan . this , however , is an awful book . it 's not merely one of heinlein 's worst . it 's one of the worst books i 've ever had the misfortune to read . the problem is n't that there 's no action , although there is n't . the problem is that there is n't anything of substance to replace it . there 's lots of sex , but not in enough detail to be titilating . there is n't a love story either ; you ca n't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason . the book just rambles aimlessly until it ends . maybe heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity , but if so he failed miserably . the characters in this book are n't just from a different culture ; they are n't people at all . they 're too flat . if you want to think about such things , ponder them on your own or read a different book . i suggest left hand of darkness by ursula le guin . i will fear no evil reads like an old man 's rambling personal fantasies . someone must like it , but i ca n't recommend it even to the most devoted heinlein fans . if you 're tempted , do yourself a favor and re-read stranger in a strange land instead
