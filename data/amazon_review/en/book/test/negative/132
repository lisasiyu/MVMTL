these damn kids these days ! as someone who was certainly an undergraduate when sacks was teaching and who has taught both high school and college , i have to say that i found the book to be quite laughable . the entire book seems to come down to , `` these damn kids today ! boy , when i was a kid ... '' and resembles little more than one of grandpa simpson 's long meandering stories . ( *gasp ! * a reference to popular culture , oh no ! ) sacks never had any teaching experience nor training and was somehow suprized to learn that he was horrible at teaching . what ? you mean to do something well you might need to learn about it and have some experience doing it ? ? ? this is , of course , ironic because sacks was teaching classes on journalism and constantly critiques his students who ignore his journalistic experience and yet throughout the book he ignores and mocks the advice of teachers who have teaching experience . dear kettle , you are black . sincerely , the pot . throughout the book he makes constant references to kids who wear baseball hats in class , sloutch , and have piercings as if someone 's appearance is indicative of their worth or ability . i 'm sure he would have a heart attack if he walked into my classroom and saw me teaching with a baseball hat on . all of his critiques would be fine if only he had done one thing : research . he constantly compares his experiences as a teacher in the 90s with his own experiences as a student decades before . however , all he offers is anecdotal evidence based on his own memories when comparing students then and in the 90s . if he had taken a minute to get down off of his high horse he might have went and talked to some teachers who had been around for decades and asked them their thoughts on students , or even better , go hunt down his college professors and ask them about classes in which he was a student . however , rather than go out and do some good investigative reporting and gather all the facts , he chose to write a poorly informed book-length letter to the editor about those damn kids who keep walking on his lawn . this book is a missed opportunity to have a real look at students in colleges . it is a shame that someone with no teaching experience and such an inflated self of self-importance ( the very things he chastises his students for ) chose to think that he was qualified to write it .
