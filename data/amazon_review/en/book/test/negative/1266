another liberal manifesto conservatives will probably dislike it . liberals will find it a good , fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole . i 'm a liberal , so it was fun for me . but have you noticed how the word & quot ; community & quot ; is becoming the new flashword among liberals ? & quot ; we are all in this together , & quot ; says mario , so we had better take care of ourselves . like hillary clinton 's & quot ; it takes a village. & quot ; the use of & quot ; community & quot ; is like the use of & quot ; opportunity & quot ; by the conservatives . both are code words for points of view that , taken to their extremes , can be far more detrimental than helpful . americans ultimately prefer the middle . just remember that , folks , and no one will get hurt
