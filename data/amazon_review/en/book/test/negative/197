skip the audio version here 's the scoop : the stories and essays in the book are hilarious , but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing , and others have been added . that 's only part of the problem . david sedaris narrates , and he has a very monotone voice . if you sit there and listen carefully , you 'll find the stories quite funny , but if you ( like me ) do mindless tasks while listening , you 'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort . then you 'll have to go back and listen over again , only to tune out the next part . amy sedaris has small voice parts in the stories , and her voice is much better at grabbing attention . however , her parts are very small . i wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate , because then this audiobook would be a gem
