true colours this is a fine example of a respected intellectual lining up in defense of a difficult-to-justify war and coming out quite convincing . of course , to come out quite convincing , hanson has to resort to some classic and tired old tricks like attacking the protesters of the ( then-upcoming gulf war ii ) , questioning the patriotism of people who dare to question authority , questioning europe ( they ca n't possibly understand us , he writes , even though we basically came from them ) , and other howlers . there are some points here , and some moments where hanson shows that he may be approaching sense . this is an educated , intelligent man . he has notable insights into immigration , and multi-cultural societies , with california ( or mexifornia ) as an example of multi-cultural change . he 's very well rounded , and he 's not an outright conservative pundit or intellectual . but too often , i found him repeating what i hear on cable tv , the same old lines , the same old tired arguments about the war on terror . he loves the anti-american argument . he thinks people 'do n't get it ' , when they complain about the usa but meanwhile want to act and be like americans . there are some points to be made here , but too often i found hanson comfortably settling into the easy chair to wax on about american greatness and international cluelessness . i like how he throws out lines like `` second , the europeans also do n't have a clue about america 's world role -- past , present , or future . '' huh ? i take this to mean that they a ) actually do n't know any history , or b ) do n't 'get ' our role in history from the american point of view , meaning unconditional support for the world 's superpower . it 's funny , of course , considering we as a culture filtered down from europe . he settles into a veiled 'love it or leave it ' attitude , with the classic , 'why do so many people flock to america ? ' i do n't think they flock here because they do n't like our policy in iraq , i think they value the freedoms and opportunity available here . hanson is either clueless , as is a president who can ask with a straight face , 'why do they hate us ? ' or he simply knows the answer but ... it 's funny , and sad , really , that hanson , and millions of others still do n't seem to 'get it ' -- namely , that there may actually be a separation between the people , the culture , and values of a country ( america ) and then the actions of the government abroad and at home . i guess you can never get enough mileage out of pointing at people and saying 'anti-american ' . by the time you finish the book , if you can , you might wonder whether hanson himself believes what he 's writing , or if he 's an outright cynic . i guess it does n't really matter in the end , since if he 's a good enough writer , then the effect will be the same . you may agree with much of what he writes , but on the war on terror , on bush 's pipe dream of bringing democracy to the middle east , well , he 's either buying it ( with a wink and nudge ) , or he 's honestly hopeful
