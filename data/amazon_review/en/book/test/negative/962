moderate considerative this book 'the resurrection'..the 'title is a way off does not specify & quot ; the resurrection of 'whom ' what , who ? quite misleading in the 'title ' this book contains a paraphrase legalistic view of someone ? by the name of jesus christ ( inside the book ) who is this someone ? popularistic homogenous personality of the ad ; s era , who resurrected in an abnormal manner , irrational or modelistic super natural sensationalism ? this unequal phenomenon of th ad era does not quite interpret an invasion of ethiologial or methodolagical interpretation in any form or manner . precautiosly , hank h. ( the author ) of this 'strange ' book , depicts a man 2thous years ago who was a 'super-artistic ' human walking around the earth realm announcing and denouncing his own fate , then 'resurrects ' from the dead ? quite symbolic and quite 'phenomenal ' , however , hank h. ( the author ) does not quite inscripts the powers involving this 'super-natural ' heroes of the other decades and eras ad . the author needs more research inside this man called 'jesus-christ ' , how a super-natural power 'raised ' him and made him a 'normal ' human again . this jesus christ , hank portrays , has to have an incontrollable humanistic inside his 'human ' potentials , physically , a human-being ' after burial can not in any form or manner resurrect from the grave . hank h. ( the author ) does not specify in detail 'who resurrected him ' was the power on the skies , ..like imentioned in my first review 'the big bang ? & quot ; resurrected this powerful created who inhabitted the 'earth ' 2 thous years ago ? if hank analyzes this 'resurrection ' power inside the 'einstein ' theory ' or the 'carl sagan ' theory ' relativity , and 'rational - irrational ' theory of both scientists . hank h. ( the author ) imiplies about the 'myths ' and other man made theories ... hank h. ( the author ) ..does not quite interprets the nature of this 'human ' called jesus christ in the humanistic form..or other/ super-=natural-instics of a super-naturla power involved.end******
