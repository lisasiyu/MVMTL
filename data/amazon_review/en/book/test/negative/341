eye-catching title as a mistitle this is a philosophy book . there is almost nothing about natural selection and not much more about religion , just plenty of standard philosophy loosely connected to a condemnation of current western culture and its supposed pseudoscience sustenance . midgley uses the term 'evolution ' to mean the philosophizing of scientists and science writers . as religion too is human philosophizing it is hardly difficult to make the two converge . this 'evolution ' midgley citicizes as being too human-centred . as there is nothing more human-centred than the social sciences , humanities and religion and this 'evolution ' is really philosophy then it is an empty criticism . only the physical sciences look beyond humans but this is unacknowledged . she is , though , correct in saying that natural selection is not about progress up a ladder nor about a hostile , doom and gloom world . other than this her grasp of biology is suspect eg she asks how genes can be selfish when they die when the cells they are in die ! ! ! ! ! no wonder the excellent work of people such as dawkins is beyond her grasp if she does not understand the connection between body cells and germ-line cells . though i generally agree with midgley 's concerns about competitive greed and the destruction of our planet i think she is wrong to blame science , pseudoscience or sociobiology and to disconnect people in modern western culture from their ancestors and their cousins in other cultures . she is clearly out of her depth when it comes to biology , at least . with a statement that evolution is the creation myth of our age plus the eye-catching mistitle of this book midgley is far more guilty of hyperbole and melodrama and potentially far more misguided and damaging than , for example , dawkins when he used the 'as if ' selfish gene perspective . there are a few interesting discussions of works by scientists and philosophers but , especially for the science writers she criticizes , i would very much recommend people read the books themselves and not simply accept midgley 's views on them .
