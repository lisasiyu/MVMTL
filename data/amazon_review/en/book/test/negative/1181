for another time this book has not been helpful to me in this first few months of loss . although it does show similarities people have in their experience of deep grief , it does not offer solutions . shakesphere and poe may have had similar experiences , and may have written about them elloquently , but that does n't help me today . i think this book needs to be targeted to a diferent population than those of us who are looking for answers
