entertainment and nothing more i probably would have never read this book had i not received it as a gift . however i am a fan of the occult and unexplained phenomenon , so i gave it a shot . the book is entertaining ; if only for the fact that her assertions about things like crop circles , the pyramids , and atlantis are outlandish and fanciful . her research is morbidly flawed , she sites several websites , and never bothers to site any credible references . it 's important to note that the book has no bibliography . many of her conclusions are a result of information received from her spirit guide francine , and it occurred to me many times while reading this book that perhaps sylvia should take what francine has to say with a grain of salt . the book is rather light on content . she tackles several `` secrets & mysteries '' , however only dedicates a few pages to each . her chapter on alien abductions is barely three pages long . for someone really looking to delve into unexplained phenomenon , there are plenty of books out there which explore these things in much greater detail and with more credibility . but if the book happens to fall into your hands , you might as well read it . it 's good for some chuckles . ( of course , it 's not supposed to be funny .
