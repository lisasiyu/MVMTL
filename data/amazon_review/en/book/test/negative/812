offensive , 'blame the victim ' tripe so ... i now learn that the infertility problems i had for many years , which i always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were actually due to the fact that i hate my husband , did n't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood . and my rather lengthy ( but normal ) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood . and , presumably , any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth , as dr. northrup 's daughter 's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast ' second stage because she had pitocin . there is some good stuff here , and it 's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body , so she can avoid avoidable problems and understand what is normal , and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking ' ( and conversely , if you just think ( and behave ... mostly through an all natural , mostly vegetarian , dairy-free , caffeine-free , alcohol-free , and sugarfree diet ) properly , nothing will ever go wrong .
