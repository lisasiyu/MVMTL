if this is classic nature lit , then maybe its just me ... i am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale , and just say that i did n't enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned - its boring and repetitive . maybe its because i 'm not used to aimless - albeit eloquent -landscape descriptions , or maybe it 's the fact that nothing happens for 264 pages , but reading this book felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience . case in point : casual readers beware
