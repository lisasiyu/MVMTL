nice intro ... the best part about this book was the intro . in fact all you need to understand what the late mr. bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction . the rest of the book is a chore to read . the confusing and tedious writing style leads to a lot of re-reading of sentences to figure out the point the author is trying to make . someone should have counseled mr. bloom that `` brevity is the soul of wit .
