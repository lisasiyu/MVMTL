i bought this book used for $ 1.50 and regret it first , the content is not well-organized . tv programs and tv memories are generational , so it does n't make sense to mix images from the 50s-90s together . second , the photographs have little impact . the book itself is rather small , and some pages contain clusters of small photos that compete for your attention . third , there is little interesting commentary . a good nostalgia book should describe how pop culture and society influenced each other . this little book does n't begin to do justice to the most powerful medium of our age
