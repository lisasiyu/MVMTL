not a great book i would only suggest this book if you have a lot of patience and determination to make sense of the authors code . the source code has bugs , and many many memory leaks . it is n't even formatted correctly . in order to make sense of it , i had to tab and format it correctly . not fun . there are much easier ways to do animation than what the book describes . if you really want to know how x files work then get this book , otherwise skip it
