nothing new . not that funny for $ 10 i guess its fine , but i did n't learn anything from this book at all . if anything , i actually feel more alienated . i do not live in the gay neighborhood of my city nor do i hang out exclusively with gay people . however , coexisting with straight people is n't even a passing thought in this book . basically , if you do n't live as a cher-worshipping rainbow flag waving poster child of gaydom , the book paints you as a maladjusted closet case who should be avoided at all costs . i agree with the review that said this is a good guide to turning into a `` flaky queen '' . also , i can not even count the number of times alcohol is referred to in this book ( and i rarely drink ) but any drug use is met with a `` kick him to the curb , girlfriend '' attitude ( i do n't do drugs either , but i 'm just pointing it out ) . the book does not answer any central questions about what men want . there is research out there about how important a good body *really* is and how important masculine traits really are for a relationship vs. hookup . this author did not pull any of that in . however , there is an underlying assumption that all gay men go to the gym , and usually that is an all-gay gym ( so i guess a good body is really important to him ... ) . as far as the authors take on the value that gay men place on education or personal growth - oh wait - neither topic is ever mentioned . the whole book can be summed up with the fact that the author actually gives advice on `` what to say if he catches you looking at his streisand cds when he comes out of the bathroom '' . so , essentially , the book is a disappointing series of common-sense superficial tips that anyone who went to high school already knows : `` do n't seem needy or desperate , be confident , do n't go into your whole life story on the first date . '' i mean , if you 're that clueless about dating ... then go for it . maybe i would 've found this useful at 16 or 17 , however . ( oh , by the way i just learned that being 30 is old . it 's mentioned about 4 times . ) i also like how there is a whole chapter devoted to what you should hide & display in your bathroom ( aveda = bad ... generic shaving cream = good ) . um , by the time a guy is in my bathroom , he is probably on his way to having sex with me so i think it 'll just have to be ok if he sees moisturizer with retinol . if he wants to end the relationship over my brand of shaving cream ( yes , that is mentioned as well ) then i 'm done too . what is amazing is that in previous chapters , `` being your fabulous gay self '' is encouraged , but now we 're playing `` hide the gay cosmetics ? '' the book is replete with hypocritical counsel , vague generalizations , and inconsistencies . i suppose , then , it is more of a metaphor of gay dating than a guide to it .
