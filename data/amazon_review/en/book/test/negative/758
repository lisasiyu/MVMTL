i was glad to read all the low reviews ... i was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because i felt like a traitor when i did n't like this book . i wanted to like it , i really did - but it was very dull . i ended up skimming most of it because it did n't hold my interest at all . the first chapter started out with a bang and i was totally hooked . it did n't take long to lose me . boooooring . i did n't like sophie , i did n't like royd ( royd - are you kidding ? perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there. ) . i was n't interested in the direction the book went . i thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes . if sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we would n't have had such a boring book . she was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time . royd was so very unlikeable i could n't believe they ended up in bed together . ick . adding jane into the book was very contrived . plain old artist jane and her cop stepfather joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer ? it seemed like a ploy to connect eve duncan with this book . not at all believable . the one sentence that i found interesting was when michael thought that jane resembled or looked like someone familiar . it seemed to be a lead in to the next book . the first ij book i ever read was ugly duckling . hopefully ij re-reads that one before starting the next one . give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [ ... ] .
