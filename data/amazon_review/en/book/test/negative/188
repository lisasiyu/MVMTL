great read but where are the wmd she claims in the book ? i read this book in 2002 way before the iraq invasion seemed probable . after reading it ( and believing that i was reading thorough reporting ) i supported going after the wmd in iraq . however , now that we 've seen how judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no wmd found in iraq i strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness . some of the non-iraq wmd reporting was very interesting and i learned a bit from that , but how do i separate fact from fiction ? as a result of being 100 % wrong in her reporting and judy 's recent comments , `` the analysts , the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong , '' which is not true ( read john macarthur , ian williams and joby warrick ) , i think this book loses its credibility . you may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction
