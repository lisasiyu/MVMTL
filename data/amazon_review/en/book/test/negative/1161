this is a long winded book that could be 200 pages shorter . this book is required by several women 's studies classes around the country . i feel it is too wordy and hard for many students in undergraduate programs to understand . the main issues in the book are hidden behind a large academic language that not all students understand . the points made in the book though , are valid ones
