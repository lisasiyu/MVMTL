look elsewhere this book promised the world , the author and his friends sounded reputable and knowledgable ; it was only the cover art that looked dodgy . we have often been told to not judge books by their covers , but in this instance , the cover illustration gives a good indication of the content : cheap and childish . the font is large and type set far apart , which makes the small amount of content fill the many pages . there are dozens of spelling and grammatical errors in the book , and a remarkable amount of irrelevant stories . ( matt , do you think your readers care that you just bought a new mercedes ? we do not . there is nothing in this story for me , unless you are going to teach me how to do the same thing . the story needs to have a point and some benefit to the listener or reader ! ) much of the book 's `` million dollar tips '' can be found faster and for free on the internet , just by doing a google search on `` marketing techniques '' . indeed , much of the book ( when it is not self-congratulation ) refers to websites where one can find more information . i gather that at least some of the websites may be owned by , or affiliated with , matt and his team . if this is a sales brochure for another online course , it does not advertise well or read well . look elsewhere for lessons on how to market and sell effectively
