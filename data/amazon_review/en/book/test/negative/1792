not what it says it is this book would be more aptly titled , `` equiptment you could and should buy for photographing interiors '' . it 's designed for amateurs who do n't know anything about photography and want to be walked through the process of buying the right equiptment and then left in the dark as to how to properly use it . i know something about photography , and was looking for a book that would talk about photographing interiors and some exteriors . i was interested in uses of perspective , lighting to add drama , that sort of thing . the writer , once explaining the theory behind photographic principles , talks , not about how he was able to take successful pictures , but just that he did . he mentions the equipment he used and tells where he set it up , but for all his superflous text , leaves the reader with only the knowledge of how to re-create his shot in the same location under the same conditions . it began as an interesting read , as he explained about what the pros use . then he explained what the beginner could buy , but why it 's not really as good . he showed a few examples of how lighting effects a scene and alters color , but in general , his `` shooting by beginners on a tight budget '' should be `` shooting in these locations by beginners with several grand to spend on equiptment '' . i was hoping for a book that talked about the uses of lighting , the uses of color , actually shooting something besides huge , open , commercial structures . this is my first return to amazon
