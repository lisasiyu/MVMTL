holy roman empire , not explained i recently read the thirty years ' war 1618-1648 , hoping to gain some insight into the holy roman empire by reading about one of its turning points . well , i was left rather disappointed . a short book , it does little to set the scene -- clearer explanations of the structure of the empire would have been good , as i was left very much in the dark as to who electors were , and what the political structure of the empire was , and what the rules of succession were , for instance . maps were the most part absent as well , and they would have been very helpful to trace the course of the war , the movement of troops , etc . the thirty years ' war is a civil war in the empire , in which foreign powers intervened , and warred with each other as well ... yet the explanations of what these foreign powers did against each other outside of the empire is somewhat lacking . so , i 'm still left scratching my head as to the structure of the holy roman empire , to some extent . the book did not fulfill the role i had hoped it to play . it certainly did explain to some extent the consequences of the war to the empire , so i did learn something , but not as much as i 'd hoped . i would advise caution before picking this book up
