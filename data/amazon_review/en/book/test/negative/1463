very outdated ! ! ! first , fix the date in the description amazon ! ! ! ! ! in spite of loopy 's warning i ordered this book in hopes he had just received old inventory . wrong ! i received the same 1995 book and when i complained to amazon they sent me a replacement . another 1995 book . while the information in the book appears good , it 's describing conditions over 10 years old which could be a lifetime for a trout stream . the clark fork , for example , is described as `` teetering between two possible futures-magnificence and ruin . '' my online research has indicated the clark fork has continued to recover nicely from the heavy metal runoff from the mining but if this book were my only guide i would be skeptical about including it as a destination for my trip . if this book were up to date i would give it at least 4 stars . but considering the age i would recommend you pass and search for other sources
