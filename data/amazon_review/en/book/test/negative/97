it does n't get any more predictable than this ... the concept of this book could 've worked , but sparks did n't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track . it 's painfully obvious who is driving the car . the dialogue between miles and sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying , as is their relationship . interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by jonah with open arms . and the ending to the story is laughable . i wo n't give it away , but i 'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages . i doubt i can read another sparks novel again .
