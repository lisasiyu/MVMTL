very poorly written i do n't have much to say that has n't already been said , but i felt it important enough to pipe in and agree with most of the negative comments . the book is unnecessarily complicated , skips non-obvious steps in the examples , provides no review for material that justifiably should be reviewed , and has a very poor approach to explanation of concepts . contrasted to james stewart 's calculus book that i 've used for the past year , this book almost makes me want to cry and turn into an english major . the key to surviving a class that requires this book is to get another book . i 'm a berkeley student , for whatever that 's worth
