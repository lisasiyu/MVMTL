come back later even though this is a `` popular '' version of the theory , with the considerable advantage of being by einstein himself , it is not so easy as the presentation may imply . einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge . it might be true in his time , but nowadays the book demands a longer study in physics . i offer myself as an example : i 'm a literature student in post-graduation level , and simply could n't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points . his reasoning is also obscure in many passages ( what are really those 'galilean coordinates ' ? ) . perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers , but they are not for the general public ( the implied target of the book ) . in brief , einstein did n't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization .
