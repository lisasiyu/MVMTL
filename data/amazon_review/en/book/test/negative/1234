vegas would be a ghost town ! after reading this book as i did , you may have a great feeling of confidence and a new interest in the game of craps . do n't get carried away though . there are studies that refute any influencing of the dice by dice setters . the only studies mentioned are by those who are selling dice setter information . the methods in the book are certainly worth experimenting with , but not with your hard earned money . if you have been to vegas recently its apparent that many people have read this book and are trying out the theory of dice setting . does anyone think if dice setting took even a tiny part of the casinos profit that it would be allowed to continue ? i think casinos love people who have read this book and try to beat the game
