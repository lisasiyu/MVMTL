a book of leftovers alas , this book was a very disappointing reading . its one of the biggest sins is having a misleading title . `` sql server architecture and internals '' ? forget it . the first whole third of the book is win32 in a nutshell . it tells you about memory , processes , i/o and everything . but i already have my richter dog-eared all right , i would n't need a reminder in a book on sql server . then , about the sql server . internals ? what a joke . the only internals that you would find are names of the dlls where this or that sql server subsystem resides and a few hardcore debugger sessions to show you those dlls actually get loaded . uh-huh , thanks . can you imagine a book on sql server internals which does n't mention pages and/or extents ? in-depth description of different execution plans ? this is the one . what this book really is , is 20 chapters worth of overviews for more or less known sql server features . average-to-good overviews of a less known features . uhm , architecture , internals ? nope - sqlxml , dts , notification services , cursors , transactions . take cursors - it says there are four types of cursors , you know , static , etc . and shows an sql snippet for each . that 's basically it . take transactions - acid , isolation levels and usage hints . oh well , it could be worse ... difficult to say without reading other books by the same author ( not that i have an urge any more ) , but it appears he has written a whole series of them . you find sentences like `` in my other book ... '' all over the place . just love it : [ quote ] i must confess that i was conflicted when i sat down to write this chapter . i wrestled with whether to update the sqlxml coverage in my last book , which was more focused on the practical application of sqlxml but which i felt really needed updating , or to write something completely new on just the architectural aspects of sqlxml , with little or no discussion of how to apply them in practice . ultimately , i decided to do both things . [ /quote ] is n't it great ? oh , the chapter on full-text search was hilarious . how about this : [ quote ] communication between sql server and microsoft search occurs via a full-text provider . this provider resides in sqlftqry.dll in the binn folder under your default sql server installation . ... the sp_fulltext_ ... system procedures interact with it via the undocumented dbcc callfulltext command ... table 16.1 . dbcc callfulltext functions [ *** a table of function ids taking the entire page *** ] ... as a rule , you should n't call dbcc callfulltext in your own code . the function ids and parameters listed above could change between releases [ /quote ] what a heck did i just learn ? ? ? i thought this book would show me how to improve the performance of the applications that i write by knowing the database server architecture deeper . instead , i got a book of not so bad overviews of different things for which there either was no coverage in the previous books or the author thought a quick reminder would be nice . to be fair , some of the discussions were reasonably interesting , like chapter 12 `` query processor '' , but give me a break , it 's like 40 pages in a 1000 pages book . do n't
