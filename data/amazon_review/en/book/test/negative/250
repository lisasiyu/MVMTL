do not read this book do not read this book . i attempted to read this book for a college class . this book should be cut down to the size of a magazine article and be published in a scientific journal . the public should not be misled into thinking that this book is readable . it is written at too high of a diction , and griffin rambles on for 20 pages on one topic , which i wo n't spoil for those of you unfortunate to read this trash . the subject information is interesting , but this is written poorly , and will bore the reader to tears . just thought i 'd let you all know
