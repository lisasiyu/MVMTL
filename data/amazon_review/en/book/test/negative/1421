interesting but the hero goes off course catherine coulter lets this story get a bit off course . when the hero phillip finds and takes care of sabrina for five days because of her illness and the snow storm leaving them trapped in a hunting cabin . during the time in the cabin he is very attentive and ready to protect her after he finds out her brother-in-law attemped to rape her but failed and still planned to do so later . when philip finally succeeds in getting sabrina to marry him for he compromises her by taking care of her the five days in the hunting cabin . he later becomes so insensitive to her feelings almost one step from being just like her brother-in-law when he physically hits her . i thought she went why off character then . the story redeems itself towards the end . i love her bride series and the calypso series , but this book left me lacking
