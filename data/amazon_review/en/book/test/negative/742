something old , something used . two of the short stories in this book , `` running out of dog '' and `` gone down to corpus '' are not new stories . running out of dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from mr. l. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people . but , it should have been noted that 40 % of this book is not original . the others are average reads , over before we have any understganding of the characters mr. lehane writes so well about . none of the others are full of tension , irony , comedy , tragedy , and suspense we 've all come to expect . they are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author 's excellent reputation . we waited a long time for another lehane . this book certainly does not showcase his talents
