weak but worth a look hope edelman 's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study . she has chosen a narrow scope for her research , and that 's fine -- that is , until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics ( such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers ) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them . the second hole in edelman 's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones -- where the basis for this statement ? i 'll believe it when i see it . it 's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships ; what 's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just do n't matter as much . within the context of her thesis , they are not as significant , but this is something that edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she did n't write about them because they are not as significant . other than these two crucial holes , edelman 's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family , both from her own life and from her case studies . it 's worth a read , not so much for its actual insights , but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own
