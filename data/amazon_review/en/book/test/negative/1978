good game , awful guide this guide is probably one of the worst ever . the chapters all look alike . it takes more time to look for what you need in this than to beat the game . the game is pretty simple anyway , so it 's not really needed . if you do need help , find an online strategy guide , but save the $ 10 for something more useful
