misguided i am chinese and i love dimsum . my family would have dim sum every sunday morning in chinatown growing up . now i married and there 's no chinatown or good chinese food around where i live . so i decided to learn how ot make them . however i ca n't read chinese very well . i bought this book because the recipes come in both chinese and english . anyway , this book tittle is `` chinese dimsum '' but the recipes in there is n't as true to it 's title . there are great variety of food in dim-sum food . most steamed meat dishes , variety steam dumplings and stuffed rice rolls , and rice cake . however , this book offers only 3 dumpling recipes . those dumpling recipes are definitely not the kind you get from a dimsum restaurant . dim-sum is the heart of southern cantonese cuisine . it 's originate from canton china and is a southern style cooking . mostly steamed cooking recipes . however , the dumpling recipes in the book are water dumpling , just like northern style . a lot more blend . northern style are the dumpling called for boiling method rather than steam cooking . well those are n't dim-sum . northern chinese people eat them as a real meal . the basics such sui-mai , cao ji . ha-cao . si long bao , are not in the book . there great variety of appetizer size meat dishes are also missing . 80 % of the books teaches you how to make chinese desserts . quite honestly , chinese desserts are the grossest thing on earth . only old chinese people like stuffs like black sesame past bun , red bean paste cake , red bean past sweet rice soup , peanut paste , and yam paste type desserts . it has 5 or six different king of steam buns recipes , same dough but different meat stuffing . well , i like steam buns , but it 's not the main focus of chinese dim-sum . i am very upset that i can not find a single recipe that i can call dimsum food
