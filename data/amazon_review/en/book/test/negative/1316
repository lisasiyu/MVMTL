pretentious and badly written i cringed while reading this book and actually flung it across a waiting area at a gate in heathrow airport in disgust upon finishing it . ( no one was in the way and i did retrieve it - to throw it out properly in a trashcan . ) mr. rushdie is obviously a brilliant man but he is out of his element writing about rock and roll . i felt embarrassed for him while reading this and i really did want to love it . the language is forced and pretentious ; it sounds like it was written by a corporate ceo desperately trying to be cool .
