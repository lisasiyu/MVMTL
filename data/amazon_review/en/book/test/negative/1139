confusing and boring story i had really high hopes for this book when i bought it . seemed like an interesting premise . i 've read other books by this author and they were interesting , at least . this book was confusing and really quite boring . the first half of the book ( 200 pages ) basically has the very forgettable characters doing not much of anything . when the `` action '' finally starts , the menacing artifact is about as scary as a ham sandwich . i have to be honest , i did n't even finish the book . i stopped about 50 pages from the ending because i just could n't stand it anymore
