a total disappointment and very depressing i 've always been a huge fan of nicholas sparks , and i could n't wait to read dear john . well , there was no reason to rush . it starts out okay , but then just gets more and more depressing . the main girl character is annoying and you hope that john will find someone who deserves him , instead of just pouting over her for most the book . i can not wait for another nicholas sparks book , but only because i want to know that he has n't lost his touch , and that this novel was just a fluck
