the book of junk `` the book of j '' is an attempted restoration and critique of the original source document of the pentateuch . bloom first introduces the proposed author of this book - an original and provocative ironist , a lady of solomon 's court , who has been totally misunderstood . the next section is a translation of the reconstructed book of j by rosenberg , who has also authored a brief appendix about the translation . the following two sections include bloom 's commentary on the book of j , its narrative , personalities and themes . this is the silliest book on the hebrew bible that i have ever read . it is obnoxious , almost totally unsubstantiated , and replete with simple misunderstandings of the hebrew text . bloom 's somewhat euphemistic admissions that he is neither a historian ( 12 ) nor a biblical scholar ( 41 ) are the only parts of the book that i agree with . he mocks religious jews , christians , the `` abominable jeremiah '' ( 176 ) and , with particular frequency , j 's god . to the unprejudiced reader the god of the hebrew bible is majestic , awesome , and holy throughout , nothing like what bloom describes . the arrogant claim that the hebrew bible or its proposed substrate has been misunderstood for millennia by people devoted to it needs much stronger support than the speculation that bloom provides . among other things , we learn that god sits in the terebrinths of mamre eating curds ( 12 , 258 ) ( a total misreading of genesis 18 ) , that god loves david but not moses ( 41 ) ( contrary to exodus 33:11-12 and numbers 12:7 ) , that moses becomes the founder of circumcision ( 245 ) ( contrary to genesis 17 ) , and that god does n't punish moses for good reason ( 34 ) , without much explanation . however , we are told that traditional jewish and christian expositors are `` weak readers '' ( 34 ) and `` mad '' ( 246 ) . virtually no secondary sources are offered for the assertions made in this book , though we hear occasionally about noth , von rad and van seters , among a few others . to his credit , bloom mentions the opening words of cassuto 's commentary on genesis ( 20 ) , but fails to engage at all with cassuto 's stunning rebuttal of the documentary hypothesis . i recommend cassuto 's `` the documentary hypothesis '' as the perfect antidote to `` the book of j '' . not a shred of archaeological evidence is offered in support of bloom 's assertions . other literature of the ancient near east receives no treatment . the content of the pentateuch places its composition firmly in the late second millennium bce , and its style and structure parallels other ancient texts of the near east of that time - until it is mutilated and divided into its putative sources . for the relevance of this evidence to the dating and composition of the hebrew bible generally , i recommend kitchen 's monumental `` on the reliability of the old testament '' . bloom and rosenberg 's transliteration is very inconsistent , and we 're even treated to the non-existent form `` v'yhi '' ( 329 ) . rosenberg translates from standard editions of the masoretic text ; but i think that for a task like his a critical edition would have been better . readers looking for an introduction to theories about the composition of the hebrew bible should look elsewhere . in my opinion , the documentary hypothesis is speculative , unsubstantiated and discredited by archaeological evidence , and the hypotheses of this book add assertion to assertion , and speculation to speculation . i do not recommend it
