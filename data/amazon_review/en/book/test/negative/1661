leonardo da vinci for kids : his life and ideas . this book was selected as a biography for a 5th grader . both my child and i felt the book was too cluttered with side bars of historical events and distracting projects . trying to find information about da vinci 's life proved elusive . there was no infomation on his childhood , but most glaringly was the lack of information about his skills as a mathematician or astromner . the focus was on his artistic ability , yet there were few pictures of his most famous works . the book did provide infomation , but in a rather boring and cluttered manner . this book is satisfactory as secondary reference . my child , an avid reader , did not enjoy this book . he said it was not for kids
