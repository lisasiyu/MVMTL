teaching is his life - his whole life . ron clark is another award-winning teacher who apparently does n't have a life away from his students . his 55 rules sometimes cross the line into `` parent '' territory , as when he teaches his children how they should answer the phone at home , and his `` abc 's of etiquette '' is subdivided into 26 rules about table-mannners . he also apparently takes students on field trips that he sometimes pays for out of his own pocket , a questionable practice in most districts . some of his suggestions , like assigning extra work as a punishment , are just wrong . new teachers will perhaps be inspired by this book , but there is nothing here that any veteran teacher could n't tell you . save your money
