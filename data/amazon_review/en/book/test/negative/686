a very self righteous look at the f & amp ; i war the author clearly has done his research and & quot ; digging & quot ; when it comes to the facts . then how come he is so bitter ? jennings spends too much time not only disputing almost every other book about the french and indian war , but also & quot ; wrestling to the ground & quot ; any thesis in opposition to his own ! he comes off sounding bitter , cranky and unattractive . his glosses over the military aspects of the war as if these details are beneath the serious historian -- why ? it was a war after all ! it is not a bad reference book but as far as read-do n't bother
