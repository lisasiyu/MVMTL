out of ideas back in his day heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys . unfortunately , that day is long past , and heinlein has wandered far from his strength . this book fills in some gaps from time enough for love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint . as was the case in time enough for love , sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme . examples : the two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages 12 and 14 and with men 4 times their age . the male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister , then a young teen , and he , at this point , the oldest man in human history . to make all this go down easier , the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued , and said to be 'tripped ' if she has her way with him . there is a lot more of this 'weird sex ' , but i will move on . this is not really a science fiction story per se , but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story . most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid america . there is n't really a plot . the book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine , seemingly heinlein 's feminine ideal . it is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career . this book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author .
