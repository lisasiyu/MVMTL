overrated this book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs , but in my opinion is quite overrated . the writing is n't particularly good , and there really is n't much meat . there are actually no real descriptions of most of the action . for instance , we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism , but that 's all ( compare/contrast to `` life of pi '' by yann martel , which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea , but that 's what makes it real ! ) . by the way , when one starving animal eats another starving animal , they still starve to death , because of the lack of essential fatty acids . most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science , unfortunately . i came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few ( repetitive ) visual images . it reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager 's diary
