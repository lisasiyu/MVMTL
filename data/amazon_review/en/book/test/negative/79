another disappointing job search book i have long been hoping to find the one career book that will point me in the write direction of finding the career that i want out of life . i 'm coming to believe that these books are mostly a waste of money . this book contains a personality test that is not unlike any other career assessment test that you can take online , for free . it then contains a boat load of charts ... 50 highest paying jobs for this personality type ... .50 jobs for this personality type with the highest amount of women/men employed ... ect ect . if this sort of thing interests you then by all means this book might be for you . most of the book however is a list of different jobs for the different personality types that contains descriptions , experience/education needed , related job , ect but it is all on a very basic level . save your money and speak with a career counsler
