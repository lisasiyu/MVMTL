loose sprockets on cassettes i was disappointed with my purchase . the first two tapes in the series were fine , but when i inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine . i checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing . i , then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem . i wonder if these products were seconds or something ? i would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today 's busy work world .
