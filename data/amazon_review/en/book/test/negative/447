very disappointed i was really disappointed especially because i had read so many positive reviews of the book . it very boring and the only exercises there actually were was one little chapter . the book was more of an autobigraphy of the author as well as about the history of the acceptance of women 's masturbation which i could have read online if i wanted to . i would n't consider this a self-help book at all .
