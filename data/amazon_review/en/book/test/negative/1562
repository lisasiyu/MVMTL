from kansas this is the most disappointing piece of childish trash i have encountered in many a day . i have absolutely wasted my money and feel cheated . this piece of junk is without literary value of any kind . if you enjoy reading about a cop who is going to a shrink to get free , of among many things , a drinking problem , but who continually walks around evenings with a stiff drink in his hand moaning about how much he loves his ex wife who is having affairs with others , then this is your piece of writing . notice i did n't say literature . an extremely poorly written piece of garbage ! !
