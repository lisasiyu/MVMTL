may be verging on formulaic persia vanderbilt has grown tiresome for me . the endless self-absorbtion of the character has worn out its welcome . more emphasis on the town , her auntie , the shop and the plot would be welcome . less emphasis on how toned and fit persia is , and much less description about what she 's wearing might make me come back . as much as i hate to say it , it was a struggle to get through the book .
