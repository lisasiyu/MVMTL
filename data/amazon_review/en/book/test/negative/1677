assumes you already know quark terminology this is n't an introductory book on quarks . it assumes you already know the terminology . what is spin ? what is isospin ? the glossary at the back is n't helpful . i read 20 or so pages and then realized it was n't an oversight ... he really has no plans to introduce these and other basic terms and explain them . very disappointing
