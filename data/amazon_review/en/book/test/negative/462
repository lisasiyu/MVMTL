use your time wisely - avoid this book filling a book with applications is no good when you compress the theoretical material . this book , although nice on the application side , falls short when the going starts to get rough . this book has chapters that are not even worth reading , like the chapter on eigenvectors and linear transformations . in general , the explanations are so short or lack demonstrations to a point where you end up memorizing theorems ( a demonstration is not a paragraph in cursory english saying `` blah , blah , as we saw previously , blah , blah , blah . '' if you doubt me , do that on an exam and see what the professor writes in red ink , later ) . is that what you want ? the serious student will then waste his/her precious little time trying to fill in the gaps with other books . i 'm not even talking from the standpoint of abstractness and rigour . i 'm just saying explanations are lacking . a reviewer said some problems are hard to do with the text , and 98 % are done by rote . this is correct . the `` hard '' problems are hard because the book is lacking in abstraction . another reviewer said this book will please engineers more than mathematicians . i feel this is correct too . applied mathematics students should also avoid this book . i do n't think this book prepares you for `` the next level '' , where you 'll be working with real problems . i do n't see this book preparing the student for computational linear algebra , and i do n't think there 's nearly enough matrix theory here . also , i think the book has that american textbook style where things are broken into small pieces and fit into nice-looking boxes and the text tends to loose its flow and you tend to loose the conections . it 's not a good writing style for my taste . it 's kind of like a calculus book . they lie to you first , and then they teach you `` advanced calculus '' and `` analysis . '' personally , i do n't like that approach , because i think it 's a time waster . and , you might not get a second chance to ge it right as an undergraduate ( this is true for engineering students at my institution ) . quickly immerse yourself in `` matrix analysis and applied linear algebra '' by c. d. meyer and avoid this book ; or , another great book ( and everybody says so , because it is ) , gilbert strang 's `` linear algebra and its applications . '' the virtues i see on this book are carefully chosen illustrations that help to convey meaning to the theorems by geometric aid and the intertwined applications `` appetizers . '' all in all , though , it 'll do you more harm than good . students who enjoyed this book have probably have n't read any other . this review refers to the 2nd edition
