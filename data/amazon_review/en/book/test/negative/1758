i give him credit for trying may i first applaud dr. schneider in seeing the value of alternative treatments as opposed to traditional medicine . however dr. schneider as with most md 's is not a good source of information on alternative forms of treatment . md 's are lucky in their 1000+ hours of education to get one 1/2 of a class on nutrition and alternative therapies . therefore their knowledge base is close to nil . most of the stuff he lists is mainstream knowledge . his research is not complete and most of it requires you to talk to your md first who in turn would very unlikely recommend anything natural . however , because americans have a love affair with their md 's they spend 244 billion a year on drugs . this in turn has made dr. schneider 's profession one of the top five leading causes of death in the nation ( jama ) . because of this md 's who are seeing a shift away from traditional medical care can capitalize immensely on this shift in care by billing themselves as experts . i 'd recommend someone who has many years of experience in nutrition and alternative therapy . nutritionists , naturopathic physicians , ayruvedic physicians , doctors of chiropractic and osteopathic physicians are much better sources of info . think about it .
