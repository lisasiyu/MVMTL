could have been good , but it was n't . the story-line is ok , even though some unlikely coincidences occur . but , the writing is very amateurish and full of grammatical , punctuation , and syntax errors ( among others ) . it was like slogging through quicksand to read it . the book must have been self-published because no editor would have let it go out with all the errors . a very good editor could make this an ok book , though not nearly the quality of susan kay 's . do n't buy it unless you are a phantom of the opera collector and just must have everything published
