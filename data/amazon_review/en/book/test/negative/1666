bestseller ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ! ! ! ! ! i had to read this book for my highschool literature class . now i enjoy reading a good book now and then but the only reason that this is a bestseller is that all highschools across america must buy the book for summer reading every year . this book put me to sleep . the only reason this book gets two stars is because of the trojan war chapter which i wished was longer . it was rich in detail and made you want to keep reading , unlike the rest of the book . i only recommend this book if you have to for a school class but other than that do n't waste your time
