talk to your doctor instead of wasting $ on this book this book does nothing but help the author make a quick buck by playing on people 's fears . i *am* a believer in the importance of lowering your bad cholesterol , but i think the way to do it is to talk to your doctor ( hopefully you have a good doctor ) who can monitor your progress and guide you through the process . this book has some `` common sense '' information but also a lot if misinformation , such as the stuff on supplements . none of them has been shown to really work ! do n't waste your money . talk to your doctor first , and be sure to find out if your parents also have high cholesterols and let your doctor know
