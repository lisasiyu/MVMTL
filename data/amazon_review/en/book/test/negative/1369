buy a grant green cd instead ! being a big fan of grant 's unique guitar playing , i 've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music . as far as i know , this is the only book about him . the book does n't go into a great amount of detail . the discography and selected reviews are worth reading . i 'd say your best bet to understanding grant green would be to spend the money you would plunk down on this book on a good cd of his- idle moments , green street , the complete quartets with sonny clark . then you can really get your money 's worth..
