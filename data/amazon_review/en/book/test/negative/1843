very misleading book there is much wisdom to be gained from aboriginal culture , but the `` wisdom '' in this book is not aboriginal , but rather made up by the author . she should have based her book on real aborigines and shared their true culture , or based it on a totally fictional population . that way readers would not believe the lies she tells about australia . the book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good , but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling . she should not be profiting from this book
