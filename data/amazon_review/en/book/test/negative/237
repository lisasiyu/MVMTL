gets mt . ararat wrong halley uses 17,000 ft. high mt . ararat in eastern turkey as noah 's ark 's final resting place when the bible says mountains of ararat in the book of genesis . also , old traditions attribute the ararat range to a different area than where mt . ararat ( formerly mt . masis ) is located . on other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old ( as most biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in genesis ) . well , like another book written in the early 1960 's ( the genesis flood ) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as dna studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim . unlike the genesis flood this book seems to reflect the author 's real genuine beliefs
