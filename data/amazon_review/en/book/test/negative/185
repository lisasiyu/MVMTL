manning sinks to new low i did n't think that manning books could get lower than wrox , but i was very wrong . unless you are doing very , very simple hibernate 2 or want to how to use xdoclet and ant , this book is a waste of money . if i were the authors , i would return the money to the publisher . you can forget in depth examples . this book has the most trivial of examples , but it does have pages and pages of exposition on why hibernate is so cool . the real meat could be put into a 12 page booklet . with a publish date of 2006 , this book needs to be more up to date . to make matters worse , some diagrams are incorrect , many pages are smudged and smeared and the book reads as an insult . i remember the days when computer books were actually helpful and useful , this book brings modern tomes to yet another new low . i thought the on-line docs for hibernate were bad , but this book is worse . wow . worse than wrox and worse than the on-line docs . makes me want to read an old vax manual just for the fun of it . this is the first and very last manning book i will ever buy . the few i have read before i was able to get the gist by spending 20 minutes in the bookstore reading . peak and heudecker should stick to creative writing as that is what thy do best in this book
