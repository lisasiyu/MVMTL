wow ! it 's an oprah pick ! ! ! i should know by now that anything oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy . but this tome pegs the kumbayaometer . i do n't know what was worse , morrie 's trite , godless , and lapsed-jewish advice to `` be nice to those we love '' or mitch albom 's profiteering off a friend 's gruesome als death . what is it with america that we flock to this shallow i 'm okay-you 're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity ? is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age ? as a sidebar , what is it with oprah and her ilk ? that a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic . safe to say , anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting albom should be avoided and anything the big o pushes should be rejected out of hand . by the way , i read this drivel in a barnes and noble while i waited for a phone call one afternoon . if you must read it , get it at a library and keep the money from getting to mitch
