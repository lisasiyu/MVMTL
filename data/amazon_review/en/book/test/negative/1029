i liked the first edition better some things are best left as they were . the first edition was simple to read , and did not seem to be trying to be the most complete guide to cruising ever written . unfortunately i loaned my copy to a friend and it never came back so i ordered a new copy and got this one . i think the author has tried to write about too many subjects and include too many different ideas- it comes off like a compendium of conflicting ideas . also this book more than the previous edition shows the author has a pretty big budget . not the best guide for those of us with more limited funds
