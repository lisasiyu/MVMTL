in the mode of a teenage girl 's diary the biggest disappointment of this book is that the comments about the cia - training and operation - are akin to what might have been written at the end of the day into a diary . there was passage after passage that begged for insight that her ( limited ) experience brought , but i do n't remember a single case of finding this . the criticism of the cia training is rendered in terms of the students ' shortcomings in the exercises , with no thought to why they did n't do better , or if their performance - while not good - was in fact passable . i suspect that the people from the intelligence agencies that gave high marks to this book are doing so because they find the public criticisms of the cia refreshing and useful/needed , and that they could fill in the insights on their own . despite having read multiple of the reviews here , i was still unprepared for the sheer amount of time talking about her personal life ( one reviewer overstates it as being 75 % ) and how trite it was . the reviews here had prepared me for the arrogance of a 30-something , but what i encountered was more the self-absorption of a teenager . the librarian who shelfed this book in the teen section may have been making a different editorial comment than the reviewer ( 2006-aug-15 ) who reported it ( reviewer gave it 5 stars for the teen reader ) . the book has many hints and clues that the author is substantial and interesting , and this may keep you reading . however , that person never emerges
