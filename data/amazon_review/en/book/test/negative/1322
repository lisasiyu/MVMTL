interesting read , but i 'm still not convinced . my mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into christianity . i tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible . it was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book . in my personal opinion , the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of yitzhak rabin on many occasions , this seems to be his only method of proving that the `` bible code '' does in fact , exist . not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in god or prophecies . ' this gets very tiring . drosnin does not provide solid evidence , no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms . the author kills his credibility on repeated occasions . overall , i found this to be an interesting read , but the author 's arguements were not convincing enough for me .
