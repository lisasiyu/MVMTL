zero stars if there was an option ! ! this was my first jance novel and probably my last . i am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book , men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable . many false assertions regarding the catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in new mexico as if it was a known fact . the most offensive reference being that god clearly must be a woman . do not buy from this author if morally conservative
