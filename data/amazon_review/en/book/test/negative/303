not worth the money . before embarking on a 2 month trip to italy a friend let me borrow rick steve 's guide and said that it was better . i was skeptical but took the book anyway figuring it might come in handy on such a long trip . she was right . rick steve 's organizes information in a much clearer and more intuitive way . this comes in handy when you 're standing in a busy square , you have n't eaten all day and everything you 've tried so far has been a jip and you just want someone to tell you where you can find a good deal . flipping through lonely planet you might think you 've been handed a manual on how to overhaul an engine - overloaded with information poorly organized . rick steve 's book on the other hand is a breath of fresh air or , to put it more tritely , a helping hand . not to mention that his guides have a personal touch and some of rick steve 's own character sewn into them . after some time you really get the sense that he 's there with you , helping you along ( - now is n't that sweet ! ) .
