mediocre ... good for healthy advice , bad for recipes . like many of the other reviewers , i found this book frought with recipe mistakes ( or are they just sloppily written ? ) . however , many of the recipes , with adaptation , become quite nice ... . the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes . what 's great about this book , though , is the plethora of information about food itself , mini-articles about things like mushrooms , green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading . interesting and a great idea , but very poorly executed . a good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful , but this edition is just not that great
