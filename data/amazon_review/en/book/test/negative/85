rmlamatt author of fears flutterby i wish mr. sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels . that flow and voice i understood so well . at first sight felt like i was reading a deadline novel . just words , no insight , did n't make this reader think at all . sorry , just the way i read it .
