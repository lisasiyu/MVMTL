for shame what is the longevity of john bradshaw 's book , and how does his writing stand up in the perspective of time ? the book was published over ten years ago , and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards , of which it was a part . the first thing i noticed about bradshaw 's writing is its sheer verbosity . he writes in a roundabout way , rather than concisely and to the point . contrast him , for example , with a writer on buddhism or taoism ( say , alan watts ? ) . writing on buddhism or taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise , but the human growth movement is broad and billowy , and concise writing may not be important to the authors . and bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement , to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all : shame . bradshaw reports that he is a theologian , but also someone who recovered from alcoholism , and was deeply shamed as a child , which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome . there are many fine snippets from his book , which may be of use to folks , but overall , i think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations . to paraphrase another well-known quotation , `` people can not live on concepts alone . '' if he had given more personal studies or little case histories , it would have been much more helpful . instead , he includes page after page of some `` guided '' meditations or shame inquiries , which were totally useless to me . if you are looking for guided meditations , this is the place for you . so , in all , bradshaw 's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time , in my opinion . it 's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth . anyway , it was a bestseller once , and that 's what counts , i guess . it did have its 15 minutes of fame , and a lot of books never even get that . diximus .
