refinement needed there 's a ton of paper in this book , overboard , in my opinion . wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious . i 've taken quite a few of the sierra hikes and the information has n't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail . they miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation . i think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in california
