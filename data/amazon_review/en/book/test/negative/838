its really about common sense this book was a waste of time to read . it comes down to this , eat sensibly and in moderation , exercise and the weight should come off . if you only have 10 pounds to loose , i would n't recommend it . it seems like this book is geared torwards people who have a lot of weight to loose . if i followed this diet , i would be famished . eat when you hungry , why wait for the `` miracle '' three hour ? i just do n't get it . i think the book was also more about joining jorge 's website
