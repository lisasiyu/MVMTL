sluggish , uneventful , corny and borrrrring i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well . i 've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story . this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative . and this is exactly what `` insomnia '' is . this is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note : at the end of the book we read sep. 10 , 1990- nov 10 , 1993- three years in which king took to write this book . three years which were evidently wasted . the other king books i 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification . `` insomnia 's '' ralph roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with . he is strong , kind , has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable . his counterpart lois chasse does n't come across as identifiable . instead she serves as a secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with ralph . king does n't usually do that with his secondary characters . other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable , like ed and helen deepenau , the three bald doctors , and ralph 's numerous confidantes . then there 's the whole abortion mess . this central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story . though king does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via detective leydecker ( albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant ) , it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device . i gave the book two stars because i am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal . the devices were obvious and all thru the reading i asked myself , 'how is king going to get through this ? ' his weapon of choice was most often ralph robert 's narration ( via third person ) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance . it seemed whenever king was in trouble in the story , he would use ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him . this is a useful tool for a beginning writer , but king used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning . one last thing , the villians just do n't work . they are not frightening , they are not demonic , they are not vicious or malign . three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors ? their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone ? the real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness . then there 's the crimson king , the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a catfish in one of the most terrible , anti-climactic scenes ever rendered . i rest my case .
