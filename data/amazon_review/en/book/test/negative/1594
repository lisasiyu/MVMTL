disappointing while the characters of this story are engaging , there 's no follow through . you do n't really get an idea of what happens to people at the end . you are left to your own imagination for a lot of instances . i understand that it is christian fiction since it refers to numerous biblical quotes , but we really do n't get an idea of people 's faith . the people do n't really seem to have a relationship with god . i was truly disappointed
