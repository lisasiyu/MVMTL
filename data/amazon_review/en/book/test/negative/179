you really wan na get bored ... ? read this book ! the story of a half-chinese , half jewish halfwise autograph man , a drunkard and drug addict who does n't get along with life , love and religion , sadly is n't even half-interesting or - behave - intelligent . in fact it is really annoying : the initial situation offers some some basic aproaches but zadie smith does n't manage to develope them thrillingly . anytime i felt just a little bit of excitement and turned the page to read on , it just started to get really boring again .
