the sequel should have been better , but was not while the murder mystery was well set up , the ending was more of agatha christie ending , with a parlor room scene and a head shaker of a perpetrator . the political intrigue which should have been the height of this story was not focused on well enough . this is a society in the grips of an awful set of diriving forces that should have rocked the foundations of the planet . but you did n't feel that pain from the governor . the 4 law robot introduced is n't given the same exploration that caliban was in the first book . you do not get behind his head . the pain of transition should have been brought to bear hear as their are real world examples all around us . this missed the boat
