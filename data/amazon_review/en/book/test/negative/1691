i was disappointed i have some of ehlert 's other books and have found them to be wonderful , however , i found that this book was so very negative and had some very terrible concepts in it . although the author portrayed activities that cats do , i was shocked to see them so boldly described in a children 's book . i teach preschoolers and would not want to read this book to my class
