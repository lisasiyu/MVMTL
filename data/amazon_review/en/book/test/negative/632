he almost had me convinced . de soto 's work was viewed by economists , historians , and politicians alike as breakthrough . he gives us an in-depth look at the lima 's informal sector and postulates , much to the satisfaction of his washington , d.c. bankroll , that peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market capitalism . unfortunately , he has twisted peru 's real scenario to reflect what washington wants to hear . in reality , lima 's informal sector is merely a way for a depraved population to survive , not a radical shift toward capitalism . de soto 's institue for liberty and democracy was funded almost in full by washington , and the man himself has spent more time in the u.s. than in peru . this book leans more toward american propaganda than objective analysis . an interesting read , but only with abundant grains of salt
