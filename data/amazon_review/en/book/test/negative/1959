the worst of palmer this book should never have been re-released . it is that bad . save your time , money , and vision . none of the characters are believable or likeable . meredith 's story might have worked if she made her vengeful return to billings after 10 or 15 years instead of 6 . i have been in the boardroom of a national corporation and 22 year old mothers do not have the depth and experience to head a domestic division even with an mba . not to mention her unfamiliarity with society and lack of professional allies in this rags to riches story . cy is totally appalling . why would anyone trust him in business or in bed ? and yet our heroine falls for him over and over again . how stupid . how could he live with his mother for 30 some years and never ask about his grandmother or his relatives ? how could everyone in town have forgotten who she was if she grew up there ? and what about the mysterious mr. smith ? although called a bodyguard , he acted only as a babysitter . he could have been interesting . was n't he worth a story line ? he did not even rate a first name . unbelievable . this book was too , painfully long with characters i never cared about . it was torture to read . even the sex was bad . for people whose attraction was based on mutual passion it just came across as horny sex . put this one back in mothballs . and diana , do not be afraid to write about a mature woman . love and sexual satisfaction can still be a discovery for women over 35
