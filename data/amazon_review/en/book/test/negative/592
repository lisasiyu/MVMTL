guilt unexplained and more i hoped to find a great amount of content from this catholic priest . i have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of god was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the lord . father tom accurately describes that guilt issue . however , instead of expressing how he found the lord to be a forgiving god and that we are in need of accepting his grace , tom moves into a diatribe of panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself . if you do n't know , panentheism is a way of explaining that & # 34 ; everything is in god & # 34 ; . at the surface that sounds great . but there is more to it . it also ascribes that god is so intertwined in the creation that he can not live apart from it . man . that is a leap ... since god is the same yesterday , today and tomorrow , and he was so before he made the earth . ok & # 62 ; ..so you see . tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth . if you want the guilt answer ... doooo noooott buy this book . instead , buy a bible . holman press just came out with a great one . read the first few verses of romans chapter 8 . then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them . if you want the short answer . hear it is . & # 34 ; we are not ever going to be good enough . and that is ok. god forgives all of us . just accept that fact. & # 34 ; do n't stop trying though . it helps others see the good in god when they see it . being good is not for going to heaven . it is to help show others that there is a good god to go to heaven to see !
