not for the squeamish although fantasies were given by & quot ; regular & quot ; people , i found the descriptions of making it with dogs and dreaming of what you 'd do to your baby neice , not only objectionable , but just plain gross . i do n't think your average person would appreciate such fantasies . based on other reviewers here , i thought it would be about really erotic/possibly romantic escaapades . i had no idea it would be bizarre and ugly . i think there were 2 i liked , but they were just so-so . i wonder about an author that provides a forum for such material
