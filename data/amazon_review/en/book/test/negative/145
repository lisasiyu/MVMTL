wish i had n't wasted my time , but saved by listening to story i have long had the desire to read a grisham book , because i have heard good things . well , my chance came and i was sorely disappointed . the audio cd 's were on sale at a truck stop and i decided to get them for the chamber . the opening to the book kept me going , but by chapter three , i had already decided this , `` if sam cayhall lives i 'm going to be mad because i get furious about hate crimes , and if he dies , he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the `` hero '' to the story . '' sadly , i pursued curious about the ending . i 'm very glad i got the cds instead of the book , because it only took six hours to get through it . sure wish i had those six hours back and the money invested so i could try a diferent author . mayber grisham 's other books are better , but i wo n't be reading them
