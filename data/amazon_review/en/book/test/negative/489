not one of patterson 's better novels this novel highly disappointed me and i 'm a big james patterson fan . the usual short chapters do n't bother me , but this novel was running over with characters ... okay ... so i do n't like too many characters that i have to remember . but i stayed with the book and when it came to the ending , i kept telling myself ... no way . but , it ended the way it ended . i purchased this one , but i think maybe i 'll get the next patterson release from the library . i think the two star rating pretty well sums it up
