bad this book is incredibly boring and tedious to read . it has no plot ; i fell asleep every time i tried to read it . it is n't realistic , as some attest , becuase the indians have the ability to talk to animals . remarkably , their dreams are always perfectly accurate prophecies ; james welch takes foreshadowing a little too far . a final warning : this book is not appropriate for younger readers due to excessive descriptions of sexual desires and acts , including adultery and incest
