this book was horrible . i love to read , and have all my life . i do n't know how i escaped reading `` mary poppins '' as a child , because i read nearly every other children 's classic book . i decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because i had n't read it . i was horrified as the book went on ... if this mary has a heart , i ca n't find it . you 'd have to use a microscope to find it . yes , there are strange adventures that are interesting . i do n't have a problem with that . my problem is mary herself . she 's nasty and mean , and there is n't one redeeming quality about her in the book . i found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on . perhaps i was tainted in my viewpoint by the disney version . but i 'll gladly take that version , for once , over the book . at least in the movie mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something . in the book she 's as friendly as a block of ice . watch the movie . forget the book
