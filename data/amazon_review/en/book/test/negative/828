anti-american screed offensive i found this book to be offensively un-american . the characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts . the best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises . i think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters .
