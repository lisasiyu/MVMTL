creepy this is a beautiful but creepy book : a lost sheep all alone , terrified by ufos no less into fleeing into a strange , deserted home , is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child . the strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel , but they are also ominous and deterring . his utter solitude , in exploring the house ( creepy corridor with blood-colored doors ) , eating , and finally sleeping , is horrifying to a child with imagination , whose most overriding terror is abandonment . i give it points for beauty and originality , none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience , and can not recommend it
