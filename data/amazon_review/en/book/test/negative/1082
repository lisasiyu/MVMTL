very disappointing being an avid admirer of manet and of the paintings in which victorine meurent appeared , i was happy to see a book about her . finally , i would be able to learn something of her and her life ! i learned that she was a lesbian and died in 1927 and not as a destitute alcoholic as written in some rather sketchy histories of her . but that is all i learned . the book is actually more about the author and her trying to make peace with her past and her mother than anything else . if you want to learn about victorine , you must find another book . if you want to know about eunice lipton , this is the book for you . also very few facts in the book ; the author puts victorine in some situations and conversations , but these are all imaginary . definitely would not recommend . author was self-indulgent and apparently not very concerned with her subject
