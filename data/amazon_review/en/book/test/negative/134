boring , boring , boring . i usually do n't review books i did n't finish reading or movies i did n't finish watching , but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on , even though i listened to it as an audiobook so i could do other things while `` reading '' . i turned it off after six chapters and i 'm not likely to finish it . this is my first nora roberts book and if they 're all like this i really do n't have any clue why she 's so popular . i 'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her , however . stay away from this one .
