we need to find some better heroes . andy milligan was a terrible filmmaker , and his snail-paced movies , which blended trash and pompous period costumes , can only be called unwatchable . his final film , monstrosity , was truly the work of an incoherent brain , blending rape , hypodermic needles , and a grinning slapstick monster wearing a fred flintstone suit . mcdonough 's book is fascinating at first , but then one realizes that these are n't artists being described with such misguided affection . like warhol 's crowd , milligan 's world was populated by uneducated drug addicts , and people obsessed with their own fractured sexuality . one of these days , there 'll be a book about a true underground filmmaker , but in the meantime , we 're stuck with the sniveling praise of sycophants like john waters , and books like this which glorify the excretions of talentless slobs
