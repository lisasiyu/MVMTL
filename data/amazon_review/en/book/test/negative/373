0 stars , actually ! in a nutshell , the ludicrous scenarios and insinuations in this book are so stupid and insulting to anyone 's intelligence that i 'm surprised it got published at all . a lawyer wrote this garbage , huh ? i wonder where he graduated from . perhaps he obtained his 'degree ' from the same place scott peterson got the 3 fake ones hanging on his wall ? unbelievable ! did this 'author ' , and i use this term loosely , ever do any real research on this case ? this dalton character who wrote this book obviously just needed a money fix . must be a mediocre-at-best attorney to have to stoop to this level of ethical malfeasance . a total lack of integrity on his part is an issue as well . for those who care about laci peterson and the truth of her murder read sharon rocha 's book , `` for laci '' as well as catherine crier 's book , `` a deadly game '' . also , do some research on the investigation itself-a lot of information is in the public domain . if i could find information on this case myself , a lowly civilian , then surely dalton could have . i just do n't think he wanted to , frankly . i believe i could write a better and more accurate book all on my lonesome ! skip this book unless you truly do n't think scott peterson killed his wife and son .
