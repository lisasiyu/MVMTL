why did she have to tell the story that way ? i have been a fan of lois lowry 's books for years , and have appreciated some of the other ways she has handled disability before . that is why i had trouble with how she handled it in this book . much of my family in the era this book is written lived in rural areas , and many were said to be `` touched '' , with the same conditions that cause me , for instance , to be unable to speak or relate to people in the usual way . they were also accepted in their communities a lot more than i have been in modern urban settings , and none were a danger to their communities . i enjoyed reading about similar settings to the ones in my family stories . that is why the ending was so shocking . there is a stereotype of disability that has caused disabled people to be removed from our families for a long time . this one runs that we do n't know any better , but have sinister tendencies lurking somewhere in our inability to understand certain things . it makes for a plot device that is accepted by many non-disabled people . rain man went to an institution and is supposed to stay there his whole life because he `` might hurt the baby '' , even though there are ways of preventing that kind of thing without taking such drastic measures , and even though that kind of thing is not common among autistic people . the boy in this story does something similar , with similar results . to people unfamiliar with this stereotype , or who believe in it , this plot device may seem powerful , and a way of advancing the sensitivity of the main character who knows that he `` did n't mean to do '' what he did . to me , it seems like a shortcut . many people in roughly that era were institutionalized because of widespread prejudices that they would hurt someone , or rape their sisters , or other things that turned out not to be how it usually actually happens . the story , to me , would have been more powerful by far if it had addressed those kind of real problems , rather than using the hackneyed storyline that is easier to write , perhaps , but advances those very same stereotypes . i wonder how many readers of this book will do the same sort of thing as one young mother did when she refused to allow me to board at her house because she had a small child and believed i would hurt him because i am autistic . that is the true danger in `` they 're dangerous , but they ca n't help it . '' i wonder what kind of thing she had heard and read to form a strange opinion like that . the author is a good author , and from the point of view of someone who might well have had the same social status in that era as the boy did , she could have written him , and even handled the issues around this kind of idea , much more responsibly
