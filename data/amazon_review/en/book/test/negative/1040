poorly written ... interesting material rendered boring the feeling the book gave me was one of disjointed-ness , i could n't fully submerge myself into the book because it did n't seem like the writer could decide how she wanted to present the material . it read like conjecture for a lot of it , with `` could '' , `` would have '' , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor , at the same time , it was too conversational , and in all just poorly written . the material was interesting enough , and her conjectures intriguing , it was just the presentation that was faulty . it would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures , as it is ... she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel , and it would have carried better .
