several problems i 've seen several mentions of grainy photos , and they are grainy , however that is the least of the problems with this book . first of all many of the figures have been traced out from the background the photo was taken with and pasted onto a plain white background , causing multiple problems , like persepctive and flat or squished body surfaces where the models were originally sitting or lying on something . the `` cutting and pasting '' is sloppily done , and in many of the photos the tips of toes and fingers have been cut off , very annoying . secondly , there are several photographs that take up two pages ... but this is a bound book , so the entire center of the body is not visible , and because a portion is in the binding even the countour is not usable . in additon to the two page layouts , there are multiple other figures that fall directly in the center of the book , and are rendered unusable by the binding . the only thing i can figure is that this was originally a spiral bound book , or had pull out pages , like a magazine centerfold . i ca n't imagine someone would intentionally publish a book with such an awful layout . lastly , some of the `` motion '' figures are cheats . one in particular is clearly a man laying on something propped up on a pillow , but he has been cut and pasted as though it were an upright pose ... maybe that explains why so many found the poses `` unatural '' . that would n't be a big deal if the book was n't called `` the figure in motion '' , and was maybe titled `` some figures in motion , and some sedentary but turned to appear as though they were in motion . '' could n't give it no stars , as i will use some of the photos , but my money could most certainly have been better spent
