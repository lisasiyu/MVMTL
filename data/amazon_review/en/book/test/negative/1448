not much value this is a very simplistic book and reading it provided me with no knowledge that i did n't already have . the author could get across every point in the entire book in a five page summary . he starts by telling us about the broken window theory put forth in 1982 and illustrated a few examples of how it lead to lower crime . he references both the original atlantic monthly article , as well as `` the tipping point '' ( which i highly recommend ) , and some other texts and speeches that are written much better than his book and that actually contain original and interesting information . the author explains in very simple language how this theory can be applied to business . essentially the entire book says that `` broken windows '' in business are the little things that go wrong , and how a business ca n't afford to let this happen . he spends almost half of the book talking about how `` people can be the ultimate broken window '' and how customer service is one of the most important aspects of your business . these concepts are so simple , that they are basically just reiterations of common business sense . this book does not probe deeply , nor does it even come close to actually delivering any insight or analysis beyond the most superficial . while his case studies are potentially interesting , he does n't spend more than two pages on any given one . this book is only worth reading if you want some simple concepts and rules that you already know listed in a convenient format . personally , i found that buying and reading this book was a waste of time . there are plenty of other books about business that contain information and insights that you do n't already know
