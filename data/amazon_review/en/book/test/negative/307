falls flat of its potential elmore leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors , and deservingly so . he has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it . what many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages , leonard does in a few lines of dialogue . as such , his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads . however , 'be cool ' is not one of his best . the concept is interesting enough : a sequel . and not just that , but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels . chili palmer returns , trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry . as always , the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen , cons , and scattered goofballs . however , when reading 'be cool ' i could n't shake the feeling that the book was rushed . many of the character ( the cop , the gangsta rapper ) are scarcely developed at all ( the latter , in particular , could have been a rich source of satire ) . also , the ending seemed rushed , as well . leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension . the reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book . i 'd always recommend elmore leonard as a quick , enjoyable , `` beach '' read . however , go with something else of his instead of 'be cool .
