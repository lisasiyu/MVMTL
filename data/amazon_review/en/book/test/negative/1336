out of her element the author is obviously as out of her element as inspector monk , and clearly has little knowledge of the ships , seafaring , nautical quarantine requirements , etc . of the 1860 's . her characters are hardly believable : sutton , the rat exterminator and dr. crow are perhaps the worst examples , but not the only ones . would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function ? very disappointing
