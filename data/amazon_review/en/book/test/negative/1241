big disappointment i used to enjoy iris johansen . this book is a super natural psychic thing . the book flap describes it as `` psychological thriller '' , but it 's not . if you enjoy the super natural type of book ( stephen king , etc ) then this is good . if , like me , you dislike that type of book , stay away from this one . the main character kerry can get into peoples minds . the other main character also does that . yes , that is the basis of this book
