drunks + drug addict + dying son = one dysfunctional family . eugene o'neill may have been the father of american theatre , but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in long day 's journey into night . o'neill 's characters were shallow , pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.the father-son relationship between james tyrone and his son , jamie , is meanspirited , and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems . tyrone regularly refers to jamie as a useless failure , and a drunk , not only to his face but to other family members , and in turn jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son , edmund . tyrone says such things as `` you 'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life ! `` ( p.32 ) and comments to edmund that , `` if he 's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey , he 's never shown it. '' ( p.131 ) . the characters of the parents are pathetic , the mother all fluttery and drugged , and the father as the stereotypical old , cheap , and mean failed celebrity . the only seemingly normal relationship is between edmund and jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love . the relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural , they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds . it is as if they entire family is bipolar . long day 's journey into night was based on the life of o'neill himself , with the character of edmund as o'neill . the mother of o'neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between o'neill and his older brother , and his father never accepted o'neill for who he was . these sad beginnings continued throughout the life of o'neill and was evident in the writing of this piece . if the characters in long day 's journey into night are closely based on his family members then o'neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine
