almost unreadable the text is thoroughly unorganized , it has almost no coherent linear progression . the author often repeats himself , uttering the `` final solution '' of the `` jewish question '' over and over without giving an studied analysis of what that means . the book is a pistache of accusations and anecdotes about people 's involvement in the `` final solution '' without offering any studied analysis of any one particular group or person . for example , we are introduced to a commander wohlauf -- an office of battalion 101 -- -and his wife . we are told that he killed jews and his pregnant wife watched , but thats about it . the author also infuses his writing with pedantry : rather that presenting the facts as they are , he is compelled to make the reader feel shocked by using exclamation points to drive home how we should feel . undoubtedly antisemitism was endemic not only in germany , but throughout europe , but one gets the feeling that the author is cherry picking throughout history to bolster his outlandish thesis that the germans were predicated to mass murder of jews .
