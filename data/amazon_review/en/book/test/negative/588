more like the portable associates degree in entrepreneurship the problem with this book is that it was written as a textbook with very little practal advice and no real `` know-how '' methods . similar to virtually all business books written by professors for colleges , this book falls very short in equipping would-be entrepreneurs with the insight , skills , and know-how needed to become successful entrepreneurs . i would not waste your money on this book at any price . if you want a great book on the topic , i highly recommend `` the startup company bible for entrepreneurs '' . this little-known book is rapidly becoming the standard for entrepreneurs .
