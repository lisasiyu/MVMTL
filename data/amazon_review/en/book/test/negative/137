do n't waste your money i was tremendously disappointed in this book . the cost of $ 35-50 is definitely a complete rip-off for what you get from the author . all you need to do is refer to pages 227-246 . those are the pages that represent the bibliography . i actually was so pissed off after reading this book that i counted them . in total the author referenced the words and work of 488 author people . there are only 223 pages of text and 6 chapters in the book . i am certain you can do the math but i 'll do it for you . there are on average more than 2 references per page and over 80 per chapter . it 's as though the author has never had an original thought of his own . if i wanted to hire somebody to go out and look up the work of other people i would have done that . i was expecting the author to use his own first-hand knowledge and experience in order to help educate and inform others such as myself about the process . instead , what i got was something a high school student would do while trying to complete a report for homework . my only question is who is less ethical : the author or the publishing company that let this slide through the screening process . for all of those that gave this book 5 stars i can only guess that you do n't enjoy actually reading
