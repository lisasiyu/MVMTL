if 'unuseful ' were a word , i 'd use it . i am a fashion designer who was looking for some good resource books to help with figure-appropriate designs . i came across this book after a long search and thought i had found gold . unfortunately , it was not what i expected . i was really disappointed with the line sketches used to explain clothing choices and found those designs to be very outdated- especially considering the second printing was in 2002 . for example , i could not disagree more with the advice for rectangular-shaped women- that they should opt for sack dresses that ignore the waist , rather than trying to create one . the chapters on jewlery choices and color charts were equally useless . i would not recommend this book to any fashion designer looking for figure-flattering design elements . `` dress your best '' by stacy london and clinton kelly is by far a better choice- especially considering the price
