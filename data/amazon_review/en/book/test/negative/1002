could n't finish it . i first read clavell 's shogun when i was twelve years and it sparked within me a life long interest in east-asian culture . in many ways he helped bring me to japan , where i have lived for a total of eight years . however after reading his works for many years , i was quite bored with gaijin , which i never finished . i perused through the book looking for interesting points but found little . his messages in his other works were repetitive in this one . amongst them are his criticisms of western culture through an asian perspective . i grew tired of hearing how sexually repressed white-anglo-saxon-protestants are when compared to their asian counter-parts , and thought my reading time was too precious to sit through another lengthy reading of how east meets west . some of my friends in japan have read gaijin and liked it ; but after owing so much to this writer , i am sorry that i could not say more of this work .
