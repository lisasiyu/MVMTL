i bought every edition of this book for 5 years and when did n't buy a new edition and i got out from behind my computer and started making cold calls , i got published . i know the pain of writing for so very long with no recognition . all i can say is that maybe this book can make you feel better temporarily , thinking you have some kind of inside track that nobody else has ( lol ) , but the only way to get published is to make your own inside track . this book wo n't help you do it
