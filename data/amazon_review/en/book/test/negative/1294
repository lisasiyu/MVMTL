the good soldier i know that i will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes ... this is one of only 2 books that i have ever read that i truly regret devoting the time to , but once i start a book i always finish.i do n't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this . i just do n't get it . the main character was quite annoying to me and the story was so slow and predictable i really just wanted it to end . i would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you i am sorry .
