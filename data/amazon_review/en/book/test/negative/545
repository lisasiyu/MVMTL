a long book that seems to get longer as you read it the relationships between the various characters were n't convincing and i failed to connect to the main character , lottie , at all . the book seemed to ramble on , and did n't catch my interest . there were a few parts where the action picks up , but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness
