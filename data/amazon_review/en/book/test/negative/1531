too complex i purhcased this book because i am intersted in world religions , especially those with elements of mysticism . i have often heard references to the kabbalah and i wanted to learn more about its contents . i am a college student majoring in biology , psychology , and history , and my desire to study the kabbalah stems not from required coursework but rather from personal interest . if i were pursuing a degree in religious studies , or had i been repeatedly exposed to the concepts that scholem discussed , i would have been fine . however , it is nearly impossible for a layman to understand the subject matter as presented by scholem . there is simply too much jargon and scholem 's writing style makes me wonder as if he tried to make things overly complex to divulge his brilliance . if you are an experienced religious scholar , most likely this book will be excellent . however , if you 're a layman who is attempting to get a feel for the basic concepts and principles of jewish mysticism , this book will only frustrate you because it 's too advanced
