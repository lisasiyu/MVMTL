did n't even finish ! i love linda howard , but i did n't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying ! the heroine was a whiny martyr -- she drove me crazy ! and where was the suspense ? i truly ca n't believe that people liked this book ! if you want to read a good linda howard book , read `` mr . perfect '' or `` dying to please ''
