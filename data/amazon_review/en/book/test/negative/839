very misleading title . reads like a boring technical manual this book is analagous to buying a new elliptical , anxiously opening the user manual to find out how this new piece of equipment is going to benefit you , only to find page after page outlining the technical details of the inner workings of the machine with the last sentence or so briefly mentioning the effects the machine can have on your life . the author is obviously an expert on the subject of astronomy and how it relates to ancient historical monuments , but he is so caught up in the technical details that `` the transformation of our consciousness '' is brushed aside as an afterthought . instead , the author drones on and on and on about monuments , angles , precessions , measurements etc . it 's obviously necessary to briefly cover the technical aspects to build a foundation for the more exciting stuff to come , but this book never builds on that foundation . there were brief moments when i thought the book started to get really interesting , but the author would quickly revert back to the same old empirical , newtonian shallowness with more chapters that should have been titled , `` who gives a [ ... ] .

'' my question is then why mention the transformation of consciousness in the title when it 's hardly mentioned in the book ? you would think that the benfits and effects of the sun aligning with the galactic center is going to have on our consciousness would be the main focus , since after all , it 's what most of us should be most concerned with . if you are preparing for a test in astronomy , this book is for you . 2 stars for the misleading title .
