biased i checked out this book from the library for a history project , but i found the information and analysis in this book too biased for use on a research paper . this book is an attack on the clinton administration and communism , not a history book . the book fails to incorporate the current domestic and global conditions in china , and rely too heavily on common beliefs of the `` evils '' of the communist theory . of course , history has proven that communism is bad , but he fails to understand , there is a reason why the government in china is still in place today . the author fails to understand the thinking , history , and cultures of the chinese . in his suggestions of how the united states should act against china , the author makes a clear statement that the ends justify the means , and indirectly states that it 's okay for the united states to be immoral to eliminate any competition . in a world where people constantly criticizes our arrogance and ignorance , his suggestions confirms the criticisms about how we believe we are the best , and everyone should follow our example without a true understanding of the situation . ironically , we are the country that emphasizes diversity , but we are also the country who forces others to be just like us even though our model might not fit for their country
