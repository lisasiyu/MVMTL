this is sick i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book . the book was anything but funny . i read about half , up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore . i consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me . the graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick . i am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but i had to throw it away because i did not want my children to get a hold of it . i found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick , mentally ill characters . i started hating them for the abuse they put their children through
