dreadful book i am constantly amazed at what can get published . the plot of this book requires the reader to suspend any sense of logic and rationality . in fact , the plot is so far-fetched i thought it was a parody . the characters are not believable at all . the reader is supposed to believe that mozart has been re-incarnated as frankie . um right . and i am the queen of spain . this is the first book by the author that i have read and i am not anxious to pick up another one . i found the plot lines and character developments to be insultingly stupid . almost too embarassed to donate this book . i pray for the trees sacrificed to make this
