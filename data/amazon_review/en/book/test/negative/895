dissapointed i watched this movie in religion and was dissapointed that it did n't follow the book . i read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available , but now seeing this one again ( i 'm pretty sure i saw this before ) i was annoyed at how much it changed the book . i think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties . the way mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous . also i do n't like colin 's strange fortune-teller like air . i had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and did n't even remotely resemble the children . do n't get this version if your a purist
