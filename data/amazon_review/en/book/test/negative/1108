horrible i tried to like this book , but by page 61 , i had to put it down . the main charachter , helen , is a self-absorbed tramp and an unfit mother . she kisses people on a whim . she flirts and sleeps with anyone in town . she talks about how much she misses her daughter , who is away at camp , but i do n't believe that she thinks of anyone by herself . she drops the f-bomb casually , as if that were speech becoming of a lady ... which she is not . the plot is absurd . that she could be as callous and crude as she is represented to be and as popular as she is also purported to be , is impossible . this character is lewd , obstinant , selfish , childish , and impetuous . do not pick this book up unless you admire loose women who are horrible mothers . disgusting , and not a very funny book , either
