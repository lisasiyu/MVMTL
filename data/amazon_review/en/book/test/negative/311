cover design misleading ... call me shallow , but , from the cover of this book ( a whimsical , illustration with an equally whimsical font ) , i thought , being unfamiliar with this author , that i was in for an anna maxted/shannon olsen type of read . ( sorry if i spelled the last names wrong ) . i do like reading novels of substance , but i felt that the cover design on this novel completely misrepresented the content . i am disappointed . i am ( substance or not ) perplexed by the novel 's structure and not too interested in the gazillion characters presented ( there are too many for my taste ! ) . also , i felt like the fact that nora kept commenting on the fact that there were & quot ; too many characters & quot ; and & quot ; no plot & quot ; in the protagonist 's stories were just excuses for putting in too many characters and failing to develop a plot . it 's probably just all way over my head . i can tell the author is talented , it 's just not my speed
