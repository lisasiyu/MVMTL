a toughie . considered by many who should know ( e.g. , e. m. forester ) to be woolf 's most brilliant work of genius , the waves is a challenging book to read for many reasons , not the least of which is the style she has adopted . more like an extended greek chorus than anything else , the six characters , whose `` voices '' sound identical to one another , speak their life stories in short , alternating monologues . although the writing is very poetic , it is also very dense and very distancing . we never really warm up to any of the characters or get involved in their stories . i had to read this book for a class and , though i 'm glad i made it through to the end , it was difficult going and i know i never would have finished it ( or even gotten through ten pages of it ) if i had n't had the carrot of a grade hanging over it . we had to read the whole thing in a week which is really not a good way to tackle this book . best read in small segments , leisurely , absorbing each moment woolf choses to highlight . definitely not a plane or beach book ! if you have n't read woolf before , this is not the book to start with . mrs. dalloway is , in my opinion , the best and most accessible of woolf 's experimental fictions and a good starting place for access into this great 20th century author 's works . then , if your brave , move onto `` to the lighthouse '' and then , shudder , `` the waves .
