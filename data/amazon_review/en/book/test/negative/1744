i ca n't believe someone would read this ! ! i found this book extremely boring and very hard to read . the conversations do n't flow and the interaction between characters seems abrupt . in fact , i did n't even finish the book that is how borning it was . now , i do n't normally review every book i read unless i have very strong feelings and this produced a very strong sense of a waste of time ! ! ! do yourself a favor and get another book . maybe something by diane mott davidson
