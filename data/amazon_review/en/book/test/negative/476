a pretentious slog i 'm sure that somewhere in this book there is a story , but it was n't worth the cost of finding it . started reading this and got 100 pages into it before saying enough with all the obscure references , historical meanderings , and pointless speculations . seems like this book 's real purpose is to test the reader 's intellectual bona fides rather than to present a well written , intriguing story . it was a slog and people who want to give it great ratings , i think , do so because they 're afraid people will think them stupid if they tell the truth . call me stupid then , but this book needed a good editor and someone to tell this pretentious author to move the story along once in a while and lighten up on the obscure/pointless ramblings . my congratulations to those who managed to get to the end of this 533 page snooze fest . you have my admiration for your tenacity . i note that people usually rate one or two star reviews as unhelpful . but take a look at lots of reviews of this book . the majority of them say it is a long , boring slog , then they give it a 3 star rating . how helpful is that ?
