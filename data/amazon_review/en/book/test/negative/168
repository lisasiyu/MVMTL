one of koontz 's worst this is truly a disappointing book . it starts incredibly slowly and i found it very hard to become interested in the plot . another disappointment is koontz 's recycling of elements from other novels : ( 1 ) plucky , highly intelligent disabled girl ( the young female protagonist in `` the hideaway '' had almost identical deformities and personality ) , ( 2 ) devoted , super-powered canine companions , ( 3 ) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out rvs , and ( 4 ) evil bioethicists . the leilani character is patently ridiculous . she conveniently has a genius iq , but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable . i found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot . koontz clearly has trouble writing for children , and this book is no exception . almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/mr or genius wunderkinds ; the latter , however , does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults . dean heaps the hardships on poor leilani , with all the subtlety of an episode of walker , texas ranger . in case you miss the anvils , you are supposed to really , really like her and fear for her safety . i do n't know how or where dean koontz learned about bioethics , but he has a terribly misguided view of the field , taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field . further , he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities ( who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics ) -- as a medical student , i can assure you that this is patently untrue . that koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow . the final issue is koontz 's near-deification of dogs , particularly golden retrievers , which is a common motif in his more recent works . it is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree . his obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic ( and i like dogs ) . this novel probably features the most egregious example of koontz 's tendency to create overly sappy , sugary-sweet endings . dean koontz has written many books better than this one . spend your money on one of his stronger efforts
