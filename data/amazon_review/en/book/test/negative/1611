boring ! ! ! ! ! ok i love everything else i have ever read by dara joy , so when i picked this one up i thought i would be in for a good read . now normally i 'm the type that starts a book once the kids are in bed and before i know it the sun is coming up and i 'm wishing 'why ca n't anything like that ever happen to me ' ... well it took three days to force myself through this one and once i was done , instead of wishing i was the herione caught up in some adventure , i was pretty happy just to be me . i could not get close to the characters , or into the story surrounding them . and what kills me is that the story line had sooo much potential ... haunted manors , kitchen ghosts ... i guess i 'm even more disappointed because i really do enjoy dara 's other works . if you are going to check this one out i would suggest buying it used
