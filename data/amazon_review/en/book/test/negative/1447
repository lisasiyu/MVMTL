the worst book i 've ever recorded ... when i was first chosen to narrate this book , i knew nothing of the racist past of its author -- i knew only that it was the single worst book i 'd ever been assigned . the negative audiofile magazine review of the recording ( quoted here on amazon ) is completely fair . reading the book to myself in order to prepare to record it , i found it annoying in the extreme -- the so-called prose is precious and poorly written , and the allegedly authentic colloquialisms are grating . when it came time to say it all aloud , for the first time ever ( and i 've narrated upwards of 200 audiobooks ) i found it impossible to invest this piece of literary flotsam with any emotional content whatsoever . as declining the job was no longer an option , i merely tried to stay out of the way and give it as simple and logical a performance as i could , but i was unable to compensate for the god awful writing , and unable to disguise my contempt for the entire enterprise . it remains the worst recording i have ever done , and i was , for a time , quite ashamed of it . now that i discover more about its hate mongering author , i 'm actually quite pleased that the recording stinks . i now believe i gave this garbage exactly the reading it deserved . ( i must add that i learned a valuable lesson : never record a book you loathe . i was subsequently offered the execrable `` left behind - the kids '' series for young adults , but having suffered through `` little tree , '' knew better than to lend my voice to the spewing of `` christian '' hate .
