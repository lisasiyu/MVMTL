so sad that women ca n't seem to `` live '' without men in this novel ! ! ! there was such promise , a woman who had `` escaped '' her ho-hum marriage , gone back to her roots was finding herself , starting her art work back up , caring for her mysteriously crazy mother , and then she `` had '' to fall for a monk , and turned this story into a romance novel . when she `` married '' herself with knots into the sea , and lovingly talked about mermaids , it had some hope of independence , then it failed , going back to her husband after the `` affair '' ( she got dumped for god . ) she did n't go back stronger , she went back wimpier and needy . sure , she had art in a gallery , but whee ... .where was her growth ? ? there was n't any . sorry . this novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad . ugh !
