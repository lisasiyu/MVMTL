short and shallow i picked this book up in order to quickly get a better understanding of mormon history . the bushmans rapidly cover lds history , but i was not satisfied with the depth of the material . the book is pretty much a straight narrative with little attempt at interpretation or critical evaluation . of course , the book is part of a series of religious history surveys for the general reader , so it is not too surprising that the bushmans do not go very deep . nonetheless , at only 103 pages , they could have offered a little bit more meat to their treatment of lds history . the first half of the book dealing with early mormon history is the best , but far too uncritical . ( what ever happened to those golden plates revealed to joseph smith ? ) the second half of the book starts to read like a tract put out by the church . it has an almost apologetic tone . when a controversial issue is broached , like mormon teaching about african americans , the authors handle it very delicately . since the authors are both historians at columbia , i expected better . it almost seems that the book was slapped together , especially at the end where the bushmans jump from topic to topic . having said all of that , i did learn some things from this volume , but there has got to be a better introduction to mormon history out there . for those interested in a more critical look at one event in mormon history , check out & quot ; blood of the prophets & quot ; by will bagley
