reinforced dogma if you want your dogma reinforced then this is a great book . it blazes through philosophical arguments with proposterous nerve . example 1 . the problem of evil is solved thus : `` and god has done something about the problem of evil . he has done the most dramatic , costly , and effective thing possible by giving his son to die for evil men . '' example 2 . to john wisdoms damning parable , the book argues : `` for in christianity we do not have merely an allegation that the garden of this world is tended by a loving gardener ; we have the actual , empirical entrance of the gardener into the human scene in the person of christ ( cf . john 20 : 14,15 ) , and this entrance is verifiable by way of his resurrection . '' all of the arguments assume the ignorant position . the argument from design is entertained in the most ridiculous manner -arguing from the specific to the general . reality is simple -we are here because things are the way they are -if they were n't , we would n't be here . too many leaves in the teacup being read by those who want to see things that are not there . i 'm afraid for humanity if they think this is knowledge .
