too much politics , not enough biography i like grant green . i always thought he was one of the four or five top jazz guitarists of his day . he deserves a true biography , rather than the immaturish writing and same old liberal rationalisms for why mr. green failed and died young . his career failed and he died young becauee of drugs -- -no one 's fault but his own .
