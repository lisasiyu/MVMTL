nanny diaries ... ..with palm trees i usually try to give everything i read a break , but this book was nothing new or exciting . it had a couple of briefly funny spots , but other than that , it was kinda blah . maybe it would 've been more exciting had i not read the nanny diaries a couple of years ago . this book did , however , give you insight into why some rich kids are so nuts - because they 're nothing more than an accessory for their parents
