this book should instruct you on the tactics of the subservise opponents of democracy books of political position ought be fact ridden . they should move you to the author 's point of view , if not the author 's conclusions , by marshalling facts first ; then an author can supply analysis constrained by supplied facts . only then should we be given some further speculation , unless moving directly to reasoned conclusions . mr. horowitz does none . instead he starves us for facts . he substitutes instead only editorial cant . i can conclude only that he aspires to persuade no one . the audience is not the inquiring , the undecided or the doubting . for example , he contrasts , on the first page the iraq war as `` so successful in its results . `` , with the vietnam conflict as an unsatisfactory result -- renaming in the process what we thought to be a war . mr. horowitz insists on weapons of mass destruction in iraq . he states explicitly and blanketly that the execution of american power is a bulwark of national security . he insists that american presidents have been either the toys or the allies of terrorists . i kept waiting for evidence of any kind . he even says the twin towers were destroyed in only minutes , yet were more important than pearl harbor . my guess is that ww ii was not so cheap or unworthy . neither were the more than sixty boys from my high school killed in the world trade center ; at least i can reference time magazine as the source . mr horowitz cheapens their deaths by saying it was the work of democrats allied with moslems in their struggle with the neo-conservatives whose birthright is the unfettered use of american soldiers and guards . mr. horowitz has plenty of notes of a sort . many are only self-referential as opposed to supportive from other sources . he quotes the new york review of books , but leaves out words he does not like . oddly he describes 9/11 as putting the bush administration `` on the run '' . he probably meant something else , but is simply incapable of precision and accuracy in general . i can not even recommend the book to those who oppose his purposes because they are so incoherently hysterical
