very sloppy writing a short way into chapter i , we have `` ... the world had such a large supply of girls , and an even larger supply of perverts . '' really ? more perverts than girls ? a few pages later , tess , our heroine , drugs one of these perverts with his own rohypnol , strips him of his clothes , except for his `` briefs and socks '' , and throws his clothes in a dumpster . but in the next sentence `` she arranged his wallet , keys , and pager in a pile next to his head and draped his jacket over him . '' without bothering to retrieve the jacket from the dumpster . there are more examples like these . when a writer has so little control over the world she creates that absurdities and oxymorons populate it more densely than her characters , i stop reading pretty quickly . so in fairness i have to say that i only read the first ten percent of this book . maybe it improves later
