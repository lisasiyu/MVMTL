blah , blah , blah danielle steel has done it once again . written a book that must have taken her all of one day . i was really disappointed after summer in st. tropez , but thought after a break from her books i 'd try again . sorry i wasted my time . this book is so repetitive , same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph . the story line seems to drag on forever . if steel 's goal is to `` dumb '' her books down for the masses then she has succeeded . this book is written at about an 11-year-old 's level . do n't waste your time
