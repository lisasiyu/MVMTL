disappointing i actually quite enjoyed this book until the last few pages . the individual stories of the pilgrims are relatively interesting ( if a bit clumsy ) , all having some connection with hyperion . progress towards the story 's climax on hyperion seemed slow , but i assumed there would be some kind of closure to the story , which would also lead on to the next book in the series . sadly , there is no closure to the story , leaving me feeling cheated . most authors are able to find a good balance between providing a satisfactory ending to one story , and leaving you keen for the next one . most annoying of all , the author completely pulled me out of his fictional world by dropping in a trite and annoying reference to 20th century fiction at the very end . i felt like the joke was on me , the author was deliberately trying to disrupt my suspension of disbelief . i 'm disappointed , i feel betrayed by the cheap ending , and i sha n't bother reading any further in the series .
