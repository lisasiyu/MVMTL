not a happy buyer i 've made 2 of the recipes so far and am reluctant to try more . if i had known what i now know before i bought the book , i 'd never have bought it . the first recipe was a complete bomb : the tofu and vegetable curry , p. 105 . i found it too hot and also bitter . thin , watery gravy ; very hot ; and a nasty , bitter taste -- yuck ! i love curries , but this was by far the worst i 've ever tasted . i 'll never make it again ! the butternut squash soup , p. 98 , was a little better . i liked it , but my husband did n't and would n't eat it ( complained of a sour-milk taste ) . the soy milk and perhaps also the margarine had curdled over the long hours of cooking . and since cut-up squash is n't available in my town , the recipe took an hour of hard work , mostly to dismember a fresh butternut squash . i 'll make this again when i can find cut-up squash , but i 'll leave out the soy milk and margarine during the slow cooking . when the slow cooking is done , i 'll puree the soup , then add the soy milk and margarine , and reheat gently on the stovetop . i think this will avoid the curdling and yield a creamier product . my recommendation to others : do n't waste your money on this clunker
