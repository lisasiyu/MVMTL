not realistic robert allen is one of the many real estate `` gurus '' in the world who probably makes more money selling you the `` secrets '' to real estate then actually practicing his own advice . i have noticed that people either hate his stuff or love it . i am guessing those who love his stuff have n't actually tried to do it . the book has a lot of wealth building ideas , but many of them are dangerous to the beginning investor and really require a lot of experience and knowledge to pull off successfully , which is not the typical reader of his books . he is looking for the person who needs to find the `` magic bullet '' for easy wealth and success , but unfortunately you wo n't find any magic bullets or fantastic money making secrets in this book . what you will find is a bunch of average ideas that are painted with a very deceptive picture of how much work , money , and experience you actually need to be successful . he spends a lot of time discussing real estate investing , which is where he got his start , but a beginning investor should understand that what he teaches is hard , takes a lot of time , and requires experience . you will probably need some of your own money and will need to have good skills in sales , marketing , construction , and general business . some of the actual investing ideas are ok , but not easily and it certainly not without a lot of work , which will exclude a lof of people . he also offers advice on investing in rare coins and while i know individuals who do this and some actually make a lot of money doing it most people should understand that doing this requires a lot of experience and knowledge and it not an investment that should be undertaken without a lot of information . overall his ideas are average , but they require a lot of work and information and in many cases your own money to truly make them work . if you can take any of one of his ideas and make a lot of money doing it you will definately earn it through the amount of hard work , knowledge learned , and experience you must earn . it will not be as easy as mr. allen makes it out to be and will definately take more time then he suggests . if you already do some of the types of investing he discusses and you know what you are getting into then you could read the book for a few average ideas but you wo n't get much more from it .
