obviously a rush job ! the book is useful , but i had to keep putting it down out of frustration . many of the examples and images do n't match up with the text , it 's loaded with typos , and chapter 7 constantly references itself as chapter 6 . that 's as far as i 've gotten so far , because i *really* have to keep putting this book down out of frustration . let me be clear , i 'm not super-picky about typos and what not , but this book is ridiculous . a few hours of proof-reading is all that would have been needed . i 'm honestly amazed it was released like this . somebody needs to get fired over this . it 's that bad . and no , i 'm not exaggerating . as far as how useful the book is , you can pick it up and leaf through to find a solution to whatever problem you 're trying to solve . but if the solution you find is affected by one of the hundred or so typos and mistakes , you might be setting yourself up for a wild goose chase trying to figure out why your code does n't work like it does in the book . ask me how i know.. also , note that most of the positive reviews here refer to the 1st edition
