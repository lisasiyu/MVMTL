support science not superstition ! ! ! ! ! the rampant lunacy and blatant buffoonery in this book is such that it should not be read in one sitting . genesis 1:1-2:3 the genesis 1 creation account conflicts with the order of events that are known to science . in genesis , the earth is created before light and stars , birds and whales before reptiles and insects , and flowering plants before any animals . the true order of events was just the opposite . god creates light and separates light from darkness , and day from night , on the first day . yet he did n't make the light producing objects ( the sun and the stars ) until the fourth day ( gen 1:14-19 ) . and how could there be `` the evening and the morning '' on the first day if there was no sun to mark them ? gen 1:3-5 in genesis 1 the entire creation takes 6 days , but the universe is at least 12 billion years old , with new stars constantly being formed . 1:31 ... . let 's not fall for `` one day in genesis is not 24hrs but rather a really long period of time '' ... ... its is stated that `` evening and the morning was the first day ! ! ! ! ! hence , 1 day = 24hrs . besides , plants were created before light , if one day was a long period of time the plants would have died before god got around to creating light . god curses the serpent . from now on the serpent will crawl on his belly and eat dust . one wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on his tail , perhaps ? but snakes do n't eat dust , do they ? 3:14 `` there were giants in the earth in those days . '' well , i suppose it 's good to know that . but why is there no archaeological evidence for the existence of these giants ? 6:4 the flood gen 7:20 the flood covered the highest mountain tops ( mount everest ? ) with fifteen cubits to spare ... ..good grief ! ! ! ! every eighth-grader knows that mount everest is so high that it has its own weather at its summit . it could be sunny and calm in the valley but on its peak a swirling snow blizzard . the atmosphere at the top is so thin it 's unbeatable . yet good ol ' noah and a boat fill with two of every `` kind '' of animals bobbing around , floating free with now problems . i get it ! ! ! ! noah and the gang had individual breathing apparatus for the thin air and sub-zero thermal protection for could . or ... .mt . everest was just a mole hill way back then ... .. oh please ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the flood story was adapted by the hebrews from an earlier babylonian myth called the epic of gilgamesh which is a lot older than the biblical tale and virtually identical . gerald spilled much ink trying to harmonize scientific facts with the genesis mythology that i cant help wondering who on earth he would reconcile other biblical nonsense such as : james 5:7 by praying , elias was able to keep it from raining for three and a half years . act 5 : 15-16 the sick were healed just by touching the shadow of peter . luke 9 39 epilepsy is caused by devils . 2 kings 13:21 a dead body is brought to life when it accidentally touches the bones of elisha . be afraid , be very afraid . this is the sort of trash proposed by creationists for inclusion in our high school science curriculum . ... ... what planet do we live on again ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
