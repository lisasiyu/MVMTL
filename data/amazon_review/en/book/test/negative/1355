disappointing book now that i have a son , i have noticed that he is much different than my daughters . i was one of those people who thought boys and girls are not much different , it 's all about environment . i was very wrong ! that discovery is what led me to buy this book . i want to understand my son better . it started out with some interesting thoughts about how school is not set up for boys , but for girls and that boys are `` hard wired `` to be as they are , but it definitely had a hostile tone toward women . i do not consider myself a feminist , but i was offended at the author 's view of females . he is a `` masculinist '' . he offers sympathy to the 18 year old patient who impregnates a girl and then is angry that she wo n't have an abortion . why should he be involved with a child he does n't want ? he says men do n't pay their child support because the mothers make them angry and they are justified in that . his views on male sexuality are depressing . men just want sex and there is nothing we can do about that . i would not want this guy in my son 's life . most importantly , i consider advice on how to raise a boy dubious at best coming from someone who has never lived with a boy . the authors has only daughters ! i truly do n't know how this guy got famous . i could only see him fanning the flames of women haters
