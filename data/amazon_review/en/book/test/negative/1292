vitriolic , spiteful and disproven claims i have not bought this book as i would not let one penney fall into garrison 's pocket , but i 've perused this volume heavily . i wish that i could have given it 0 stars . the author is an unreconstructed confederate who , whenever there is a remotely possible sinister way of interpreting lincoln 's actions , prefers to submit that view rather than acknowledge the findings of recognized scholars ' research . for example , he claims that lincoln is responsible for the creation of the & quot ; imperial presidency & quot ; , making possible the abuses of nixon , vietnam , etc . but he does not show that lincoln 's powers were often balanced by a war conduct committee , that the presidency went on to lose considerable authority and esteem in the reconstruction years , and that lincoln himself acknowledged that , except in the case of national emergencies , as the civil war was viewed , the president lacked powers to do many things ( like the emancipation proclamation ) . garrison also blames lincoln for being uncompromising and contends , without proof , that the confederacy 's desire to continue as a separate nation would have faded , if allowed , resulting in reunification . but most scholars acknowledge that the individual states would have sooner seceded even further into smaller nations , and that other states in the union would have found reason to secede into new confederacies . thus , as i 've said , garrison 's trash has been disproven yet he pretends as though it has not even been noticed by scholars . it is the vitriolic spite of an unenlightened confederate clinging to the bitterness of ancestors . this book should be relegated to the heap of trash-writing never to be recovered
