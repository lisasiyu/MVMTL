p l e a s e . . . buy something else many reviewers on this site read tlgpe in the 70 's , when we were young and impressionable . ( i happened to be 13 when i read it . ) if one could be sued for intellectual forgery , lindsey would certainly be found at fault . most of us , thankfully , have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years . after all , when we read tlgpe , we were young . we were searching and seeking . we did n't have all of the facts . there were wolves who knew this , and they preyed upon us . many people who were older , yet still intellectually undeveloped , read this book and were moved to 'believing ' . for most of us , our minds matured . we began to see the vast chinks in lindsey 's pompous christian armor . we began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen , by people who use a subtle , gentle cloth of manipulation to control others . this is beyond dangerous . it is beyond extreme , as most of us have now found out . i love a good horror novel . i love a good 'true crime ' thriller . but the fact that people read lindsey 's books and take them at face value is , perhaps , one of the scariest notions i have ever imagined . that , dear reader , is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you 'll find in the bible or any of lindeys 'books ' . the only thing scarier is that mr. lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated , silly , contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago . please do n't be the next sucker . please do n't add this one to your cart .
