too artsy for its own good i thought i was going to get a thriller when i first heard of this . instead i got a pseudo-sequel to cold mountain set in 1980 texas , and i have rather low opinions of cold mountain . it was difficult to follow the story due to mccarthy 's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue ( a move i 've always considered to be a pretentious affectation ) , but also commas , apostrophes , and proper spelling , such as not capitalizing `` english '' or using `` livingroom '' instead of `` living room '' and `` mam '' instead of `` ma'am . '' i do n't know if this is something mccarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal , but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable . i also did n't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of sheriff bell at the beginning of each chapter/section , as he tended to ramble on about life after world war two and how it was n't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of delaware . hopefully its movie adaptation ( which i legitimately pity the coen brothers for having to wade through ) is more accessible
