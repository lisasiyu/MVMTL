i was duped ! ! ! ! ! ok , people , here 's some advice before you think about buying this book . do n't just look at all the 4 and 5 star customer reviews - rank the customer review list from lowest rank first and read all the 1 star reviews as well . that way you can really get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into . sure , in both the high reviews and the low reviews there 's just basic no-brainer reviews - `` it 's great ! ! '' or `` its sucks ! ! '' but amongst all the one star reviews i discovered some smart punters whom i should have read before buying the damn book myself . yup , i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews i realise that some reviewers had duly warned me . this book is terrible . it gives only the scantiest of basics on body language , stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write . and the photos - my god ! its mr steele with his wife and their friends , posing away in their garish shirts and shorts ... these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for `` flirting '' and `` body language '' i 've ever ever seen . and in his blurb photo at the front of the book he 's standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest - there 's something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that i find highly disturbing . yucko . as others have said , if i could give this book a zero star rating , i would . avoid , everyone , avoid like the plague .
