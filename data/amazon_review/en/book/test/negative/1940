i agree i agree with the reviewers who found this series `` stuffy , predictable and annoying '' and advised , `` you might as well buy a romance novel . '' ( or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts . ) what horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned peters in the same sentence with jane austen and the brontes ! ! austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time , but chose to demonstrate it , rather than rant or lecture against it , as many authors and poets were doing . in a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws ' cruel unfairiness to women . the little girl asks , `` why do we have to move ? '' and her mother explains simply , matter-of-factly , that 's the way it is . as outrageous as the law itself is the docile , ( seemingly ) unquestioning acceptance of it . austen did n't go into an enraged diatribe , just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message . peters would do well to emulate really good writers : demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events , rather than repetitive , tiresome descriptions
