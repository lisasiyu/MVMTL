i feel dirty now this book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend , becomes depressed , and then becomes friends with a young boy ( i think 10 ? 12 ? i do n't remember ) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had aids and writing a book on it . except as the book goes on , it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists . all well and good , but what really makes the book stand out is n't the storyline . noooo . it 's the slashy overtones where there really really squickily should n't be any ! i should not get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author 's fantasy . no , no , no . i felt dirty after reading this . i felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it . this is a scary scary man , and makes me want a long long bath .
