art is great , story ... .not so much - buy when paperback comes out the general feeling i had left after reading through this graphic novel was , that was it ? costing anywhere between 17 and 25 bucks this title hardly pays for itself . the book overall has a couple of different stories split up , all set in the halo universe . a good way to describe this book is , it 's like the animatrix , short stories based in a specific fictional landscape that are at best , cool and at worst mediocre . the art in every one of these short stories in this book were all top notch but , the shortness of the short stories just left me with again , the feeling of : that 's it ? my suggestion to halo fans out there ? wait till this comes out in trade paperback form when it 'll be about 10 bucks , then it might be worth buying .
