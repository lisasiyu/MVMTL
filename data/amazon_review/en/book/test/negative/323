boring narrator i have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio cds from the library . i was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author . he sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in `` w '' - it drives me mad . he reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on . i am a big fan of audio cds because i can listen to the stories while doing other things - i 'm not tied down to the couch . i have listened to many narrators - jim dale for one - and have never hated listening until now . charles frazier may be a `` brilliant '' author , and should stick with writing - period ! leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life
