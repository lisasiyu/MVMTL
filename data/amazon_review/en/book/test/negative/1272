disappointing for the educated reader the editors ' review would lead you to believe this is an unbiased , thorough and scholarly examination of cultural anthropology . it is not . there is subtle age , gender , cultural and religious bias . although it is a thorough look at various cultures , it is by no means comprehensive or accurate . it is inaccurate in highlighted descriptions of minor aspects of native american culture , especially of the eastern band of the cherokee nation . it seems to imply western european cultures and various organized religions are the greatest evil on the planet . the portrayal of some cultures , such as the malaysian , pacific island , and a few of the african bushmen cultures , are very nice but that is the only redeeming quality of this text . real scholars should avoid this text at all costs
