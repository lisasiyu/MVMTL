how did this ever become a national bestseller ? this nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective . the research is suspect . the prose amateurish . the details gossipy and contrived . if eleanor roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism , then cook has done her an unforgivable disservice . if you 're looking to understand roosevelt 's honest-to-goodness place in history , you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work
