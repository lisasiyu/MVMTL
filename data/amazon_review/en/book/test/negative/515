i 'm really working hard to finish it but its a stuggle ! i 'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not cussler 's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his ? way too many characters - i 'm no dummy , but i have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the `` cast of characters '' he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters . the story is n't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are , there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it . i hope it gets better as it goes along , but i doubt it
