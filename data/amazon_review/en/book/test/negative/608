very very basic information if you have had to take out a mortgage to buy a house , have ever purchased life insurance or have a retirement account , this book will seem extremely basic . there are n't really any tools , worksheets or practical plans here . the book is simply a series of `` tips '' -- very brief articles from different financial planners . it 's a readable format , but there 's not much meat . for example , the section on `` software for staying organized '' includes mention of only 3 software products , two of which are microsoft money and intuit quicken . the author starts her comments saying `` the basic/standard versions are entry-level products designed for people new to personal finance software '' ( my experience with the basic versions of those programs is that they include quite powerful analysis and budgeting tools ) . if you 're just starting out or really need a primer , this is a readable book and comes well recommended . but if you are reasonably literate in working with lenders and insurance companies , you 'll find this too simple
