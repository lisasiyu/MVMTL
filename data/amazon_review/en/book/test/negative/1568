full of inappropriate conclusions , but well-intentioned i can see very little reason for the dalai lama to write a book on science . he is out of his league in writing this book . he does not at all understand his subject matter . his points on the convergence of modern physics and buddhist philosophy are irrelevant . first , any similarities between modern cosmology or quantum mechanics and buddhist philosophy are purely coincidental , and are not reflective of any deep truth . we arrive at scientific knowledge through a process of hypothesization and experimentation , the hypotheses being rigidly defined and definitely falsifiable . buddhist philosophy does not contain this same element of falsifiability , its grounding in the empirical world being loose and open to interpretation . one can not describe an objective procedure to rigorously falsify a buddhist claim . further , these claims are not rigidly defined , and widely open to interpretation , unlike the claims of modern physics , which result in a single answer to a calculation ( although in practice one will end up making subjective approximations , but there is a procedure for estimating the error incurred in these approximations ) . second , it is not at all surprising that one can draw some superficial parallels between physics and buddhism , because the body of buddhist thought is large enough and equivocal enough that one could point to similarities no matter what physics ' worldview is . i do not understand the dalai lama 's request that research in the subject of consciousness include internal examination . the definition of the nature of this internal examination is unclear , and procedure for carrying it out are not described . his suggestions are useless to scientists without being made more clear . his claims on what science is and is not capable of achieving or understanding are based on insufficient knowledge . even respected , established scientists who make claims on what science can not achieve have historically been proven incorrect many times over . i commend the dalai lama 's interest in science . further , i am amazed at his open-mindedness in writing , `` if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in buddhism to be false , then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims . '' he proved true to his word in renouncing certain buddhist beliefs about the physical workings of the universe . however , his understanding of the method and teachings of science proved superficial when he argued that because science has not conclusively proven it completely understands the beginning of the universe or the origin of life , this leaves room for supernatural influence to have caused the universe to exist , or for new souls to inherit old ones through reincarnation . science treats questions of the supernatural ( defined as those things beyond nature , in other words those things that can not be observed ) as fundamentally unanswerable and uninteresting , but the dalai lama does not seem to understand this attitude . the dalai lama has discussed science with many leading researchers and philosophers of science , such as david bohm and arthur zajonc . i have no doubt that these he is well-informed , and that these men have done their best to impart their knowledge . but the gap between western and eastern thought in this case may be too wide to be easily bridged , and the responsibility lies in another man to do it . it may be that no one alive has a truly deep understanding of both buddhist philosophy and the philosophy of science . finally , i also applaud the dalai lama 's calls for collaboration , and his attempts to spread some introductory knowledge of buddhist thought . but the task of creating productive dialogues between scientists and buddhists is an overwhelming one , involving not only language barriers , but barriers involving fundamental modes of thought . this book is not equal to the challenge , but i think the dalai lama 's initial efforts are at least a step in the right direction
