very disappointed i was particularly interested in one of the two enclosed disks - 1 cd - same title as the book , and 1 dvd - primal 3d anatomy . the disks are highlighted on the cover , and described in intriguing detail on the back cover . but wait - inside the front cover , the last paragraph on another `` highlight '' it says `` the second cd contains a 45-day free trial '' . the same note appeared on the disk but it was covered by the notice to consumer . my conclusion was this misleading presentation was intentional ! ca n't return it now because the disk seals are broken . the management at lippincott williams & wilkins should be sent up the river in chains
