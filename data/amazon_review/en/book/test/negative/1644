just not enough ... very very basic ! i bought this book , hoping it would go farther than getting into the `` front door '' of dming . i kept reading , telling myself , no it is going to go into depth , it is going to hit on some substance , but it never did . it spends too much of its time , focusing on the `` dummy '' concept . it repeats itself over and over again , stating `` you are the dm , you are the one that runs the game '' . yes i know that , now get on with the book , i kept saying ! if you are a totally new dm , then this book will be helpful . if you have run a game , a couple of times , then you have probably already figured out all of the concepts mentioned here .
