entirely awful book great expectations was perhaps one of the worst book ever written . i 'm no dickens ' expert , but i do know a little about literature- i do n't know how this even passed through the editing stage . it is slow-paced , boring , pointless , and an all-out waste of time to read . i have read challenging books with strong points like this before , and have sometimes enjoyed them , but never have i read a book this pointless and difficult to read , with such a stupid ending . dont waste your money and valuable time on it ! ! ! ! ! !
