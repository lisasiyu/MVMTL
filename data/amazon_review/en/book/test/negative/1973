mediocre collection of short stories the stories collected in this book offer the promise of exciting stories dealing with the knights templar , a topic that begs to be handled intelligently in fiction format . what the reader gets instead are weak 20-30 page stories that offer absolutely nothing for the reader that may intrigue , educate or even entertain . the authors who contributed seem to be accomplished writers in their own right , but that is not evident with these stories . some are poorly written ( such as & quot ; the city of brass & quot ; ) and others deal with the topic of the templars in ridiculous ways . one thing that really bothered me was the addition of kurtz 's short story that takes place within the story of her own series of books ! basically , i would have to read her books to make even the slightest sense of the short story . very poorly thought out . the best thing about this collection ( and the only reason i gave it two stars ) were the interludes between stories , which offered up some basic info on the knights . definately not worth buying this book for , though
