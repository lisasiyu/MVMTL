pretty poor effort i 'm a long time fan of the anna pigeon mysteries , and have read all the others . unfortunately , `` hard truth '' does not live up to the quality of ms. barr 's earlier works . it feels very contrived . it also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups . this book just does not meet the expectations i 've come to expect from the series .
