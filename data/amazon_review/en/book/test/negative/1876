pointless the illustrations in this book , an artful combination of digital realistic media and traditional pen and ink are brought together in splashes of color and images that delight the imagination . however , fantastic illustrations alone can not make up for a story line that lacks creativity and warmth . an almost robotic tone takes the reader through a day in the life of our mischievous protagonist whose actions , such as `` showing joey whipple my underpants '' and setting shoes on fire using the sun and a magnifying glass go a step beyond acceptable childish pranks . the story ends abruptly without closure and without endearing the characters which leaves the reader wondering `` what is the point ?
