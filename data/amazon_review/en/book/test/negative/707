do n't drink soy milk either ! frank oski draws attention to the very real health dangers of commercial dairy products . unfortunately , he does consumers a grave disservice by encouraging the consumption of soymilk , an alternative that is even riskier . soymilk was rarely drunk in asia prior to the 20th century and like other modern , nonfermented soy products has been linked to digestive distress , thyroid damage , cognitive decline , add/adhd , immune system breakdown , infertility , reproductive disorders and even heart disease and cancer . sadly , many people have seen their health seriously deteriorate because of soy milk . children are at such risk that in july 2005 the israeli health ministry issued a health advisory warning parents that they should not feed their children soyfoods or soymilk more than once per day or a maximum of three times per week . for people who would like to explore all sides of the milk controversy , i highly recommend ron schmid 's `` the untold story of milk ''
