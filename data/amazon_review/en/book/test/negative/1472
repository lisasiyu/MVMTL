small graces i read about this book in a catalog , i was intrigued , so i ordered a copy . the book arrived today i read through it and found it to be quite ordinary . it was n't a smooth read . very choppy . not inspiring in fact it was somewhat depressing . i was very disappointed . i will return the book to the catalog company today for a refund . save your money and look elsewhere for life changing book
