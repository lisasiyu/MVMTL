an interesting mix of good and bad . im not really writing this review to sway anyone 's opinion of it . tastes are different from person to person . some may love this book , others may hate it , and a few will think its okay , that is just the way things are . i only wanted to share my opinion about it , because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever i think about it . the first time i read this book i hated it . i have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice i still do n't like this book at all . yet , during both times that i read it i could not put the book down . this is the bizarre duplicitous nature of the relic . i do not like the story or the characters , but still i have been drawn in . as much as i hate to admit it i consider this book to be a real page-turner . i do n't think i need to go into the plot so i will list the offenses this book commits ( once again this is just my opinion ) . predictability - i dont think i was surprised even once while reading this book . it gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days . from the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul , or merely here to serve as entree 's for the monster . the outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all . not to spoil any surprises but i 'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief 's escape route . throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums ' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and ... well i think you allready know where this is going . poor characters - all your cliche 's are here . from the overworked , underappreciated heroine , who puts all the pieces together , to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums ' premier even after numerous , grisly murders . why ? do you ask . because of revenues of course . i wonder if the museums ' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie jaws . if the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche ' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do . if i heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum i was gaurding , especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity , i would call for backup before i investigated . of course i am sane , so reverse what i would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take . unbelievability - there were many times while reading this book when i had to stop and say , `` give me a break . '' i also used the expressions , `` oh , please '' , and `` that is so stupid ! '' . many times we are expected to deny common sense , and reason so that the story can progress . of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet , then this book would probably only be 100 pages long . so in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank . im not kidding , this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects . i do n't want to give anything more away , but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book . many `` what a rip-off '' moments - to often while reading this book i found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it . there is a reason so many people compare this book to jurrasic park , many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of chricton 's book . so instead of putting the quote `` far above chricton 's jurassic park '' on the cover of the relic , i would have put `` not above taking ideas from better books '' . put jurrasic park , congo , and jaws in a blender and you have the relic . this `` borrowing '' of ideas seems so bad at times that i wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of the relic sold micheal chricton received royalties . once again i feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity , and predictability , i could not put this book down . for that reason alone this book is probably worth reading , and sharing with your friends . then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another , probably better , book
