waste of money as a beginning blogger , i was disappointed with this book . i generally like the dummies series and have found them useful and entertaining . this one is not . the author is sarcastic -p. 3 `` what you 're not to read - i forbid you to read trashy novels from the supermarket . '' really ! the information on blogger does n't add anything that ca n't be found on blogger help screens . several blogging services , for example edublog , are not mentioned at all . last , the part of tens was not as neat as in most of the dummies books . i want my money back
