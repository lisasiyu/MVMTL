the worst of them all huge disappointment . trace was n't that good either . having read all scarpetta 's previous storiesbut i was hoping trace would be only bad one . however , the downhill trend seems to continue . these two books are not the usual intelligent plots cornwell is capable of writing . save your money , do n't buy it . i completely agree with all the reviews posted so far , so i wo n't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details
