a hard , laborious read like many people , i bought this book to distinguish between a very entertaining movie , amadeus , and the truth . i am a musician and am very interested in truly talented and practiced musicians wether they be current or of historically mythic proportions . the effort and research in this book is excellent but , unfortunately , it is full of psychology and psychoanalysis which i 'm not particularly interested in . it may be more interesting if it was proven data but these analyses are little more than guesses by a writer . how do you get deep , deep into the head of someone from well over two centuries ago ? i 'm sure some of solomon 's conclusions are valid but i kept finding myself looking to see how much more of the book i had left to go so i could say i finished it and get onto something much more pleasurable
