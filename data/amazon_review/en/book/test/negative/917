does n't compare this book does not compare with 1 ) atlas shrugged , or 2 ) the fountainhead . in my opinion , those are two of the finest books ever written . if you have n't read them , put we the living aside and read them now . i could not finish we the living . i got sick of the stupid relationship . i guess i got about 1/4th the way through . maybe my tastes are changing
