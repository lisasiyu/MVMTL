some interesting insights ... .but based on faulty assumptions i found the book to be an endless and somewhat unnecessary attack on classical theism . her notions of pauline theology , based on a platonic dualism , have been shown to be baseless . the disparities and divisions of the church and society are not proven in her work to stem from classical theism , but are assumed . the church which she diminishes has worked to bridge culturally created divisions , which she fails to admit to . her pandering into pantheism and panentheism are also disappointing , for she reveals her true intention of not reforming the church , but espousing a new religion
