same old stuff i hate to rain on everybody 's parade , but i found this book to be a rehash of stuff i 've read over and over in other places . there 's too many numbers in here . what people need is an attitude about money , not just & quot ; save so much money for so long at 10 % interest per year and you 'll have so much saved for retirement at 65 , but if you wait until you 're 35 to start , you 'll only have this much saved ... . & quot ; ( that 's not a quote from the book , but you can place that quote in almost any financial book , and it will fit just fine ) . personally , i thought the millionaire next door was better and rich dad poor dad in a leauge of its own . any book on this subject will certainly convey & quot ; some & quot ; information . the problem is that they are too number oriented . people need to focus on paying themselves first regularly , having a set savings program and intelligent investments . this book seems to be more focused on getting rich by retirement . that 's just great , but anybody who saves money over 40+ years darn well better be rich by retirement or they do n't know what they are doing . on the other hand , i think the authors are realistic in the sense that this is not get rich quick by any means . if you want to sum it all up , no matter who you are or what your circumstances are , save money on a regular and consistent basis , cut up all of your credit cards , pay cash for everything , keep your wants and spending under control and that 's about it really . it 's not that hard to get rich . i just wish the book had more practical information and less technical analysis with all those numbers and statistics
