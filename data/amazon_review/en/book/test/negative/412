eh , whatever . i bought this cookbook expecting it to have a few fun , easy recipes for wraps that i could toss together with stuff i had around the kitchen . although the recipes and certainly the pictures look delicious , fun and easy they 're not . it 's not uncommon for recipes to have over a dozen ingredients . when i want to toss together a little lunch , i do n't have time to track down 1/4 cup chopped pickled ginger or 2 cups cooked jasmine rice or 1/4 teaspoon orange oil . i have yet to make a single recipe from this book , despite having owned it for over nine months
