why are you writing this book ? i do n't know while i was reading american normal , i kept asking myself , why is he writing this book . someone finally asks the author the same question , and his answer is , & quot ; i do n't know. & quot ; i have a theory . osborne started out to write a book showing that as is an imaginary problem coined to put labels on eccentrics . when halfway through the book his research shows him that it 's quite a lot more than that , in fact a real syndrome completely different from just & quot ; a little eccentricity & quot ; , he is lost . he no longer knows why he is writing . he keeps mentioning drugs . there are no drugs in the treatment of as itself . he keeps metioning psychiatrists . it 's a neurological disorder , not a psychiatric disorder . he meets , casually , a few aspies , and suddenly he 's an expert . this book mostly made me angry , as it would anyone who knows someone with as . he seems often to think the whole this is a joke . after all , he 's eccentric , and he does n't have it ... worst book i 've read on autism yet . pit
