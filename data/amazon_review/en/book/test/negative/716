total garbage wow . i wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of no stars . o'reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it . fiction is clearly not his strong suit . his characters were cardboard cutouts , his dialogue stilted and ludicris , his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes , and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation . reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy 's mind really is . if this trash is any indication of o'reilly 's true worldview , he 's a sick , sad man indeed
