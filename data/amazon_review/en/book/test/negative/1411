not well researched and partisan this may be the worst book i 've ever finished . i was expecting a book that would offer small tidbits of funny information , some shots , and some glorious facts about the great men who have led our country over the various centuries . instead , we are treated to a salacious compendium of president 's peeing on secret service men and other president 's blaming secret service men for farting . if you are looking for `` the man show '' version of the presidents , then by all means fork over your hard earned dollars . we are informed that every republican from ike to bush were bumbling idiots , and every democrat from fdr to clinton were mere victims of circumstance . if you are looking for a michael moore or al franken version of the historical lives of some of the greatest men who ever lived , then by all means add to cart . thanks to this author 's portrayal of u.s. presidents , i will forever read an author 's portrayal of the two most divisive presidents of our time , nixon and clinton , before i make such a purchase again . nixon and clinton were both failures in their own right . nixon and clinton were both men blessed with an overwhelming amount of potential , but they both flushed it away with their individual incidents . o'brien ends each portrayal with an accurate summary of the unfortunate end of each of the individual tenure , but it is within the body of these portrayals that o'brien lends his creative writing skills to the eventual manipulation of the reader . examples to the point , newt gingrich is snide and rapacious , and kenneth starr is a ruthless republican bloodhound . do we really need these adjectives ? we read no such adjectives to describe the behaivor of the democrats in power during nixon 's term . we see no adjectives or adverbs to describe the activities of a woodward and bernstein . i would consider it silly for a compendium of this sort to glorify the presidency of nixon , for his tenure was not one to emulate . nixon and clinton had their otherwise promising presidencies brought down by silly incidents that would 've been seen as such were it not for the cover-ups that followed . o'brien goes onto to proclaim bob jones university as preposterously conservative , he declares the great society as a legislative success . it maybe true that the great society was a success in accumulating enough votes for passage , but can the great society be considered a success in an historical perspective ? he portrays the anti-american carter as the greatest living former president in recent memory . he mentions carter 's farcical nobel peace prize as testament to this fact . what is this ? everyone knows that that prize was a joke provided by the nobel people looking to make an anti-american statement . it should be noted that the great peace activist yasser arafat also won this award . o'brien fails to mention the johnson administration 's propaganda involving the gulf of tonkin incident that johnson used to convince american 's that america 's role needed to be escalated in vietnam . it was an incident historians are now claiming never happened , but this is n't used to define johnson 's administration ? he maintains that every republican since ford gained office with shenanigans and slick marketing . he ends the book with the moore/franken style rants against the george w. bush election , which many nonpartisan publications -- including the democrat miami herald and the usa today -- are saying they could 've recounted until the end of time and bush would 've won . he comments on bush 's slick maneuvering to enter into the war with iraq . i will grant you that this book was written before news of the the oil for food un scandals broke . these scandals involved france , germany and russia , and this scandal may have affected the manner in which pre-war activities were conducted . all in all , should n't a book of this variety be written to open debate rather than close it with propaganda material ? i found some of the portrayals of presidents one rarely hears mentioned , such as zachary taylor and franklin pierce , but i found myself reevaluating all of these portrayals after reading about those with which i am much more familiar . i am currently an unsuccessful author , but i have written enough , and studied the craft enough , to know a writer 's manipulation when i see it . it 's a shame too , for this could 've been such an interesting idea . as i have mentioned , cormac o'brien has taught me a valuable lesson when buying historical perspectives : try and learn the author 's agenda before buying his book . i have read a couple of books of this sort that will lambaste and glorify an lbj or a clinton as often as they lambaste and glorify a nixon or a reagan . while i will agree that it is difficult for an individual to separate himself from his perspective , it should always be the responsibility of said author to keep this to a matter of degrees . it is my hope that the anxious readers who share my love for information , regardless of their individual biases , will search elsewhere
