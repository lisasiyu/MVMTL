you do n't need this book ... i was so happy to see that someone wrote a book about protools 5.1 ... and of course i did buy it right a way ... . then i was shocked when i started to read it ... . this book is only a really simple reduction of the protools reference guide ... . and actually a lot , lot less ... .. i was hopeing to learn some new staff and some tricks ... well , i lost my money..
