way too fluffy for my taste this book should have been called `` beautiful interior designs that happen to include some home theater gear '' , or `` home theater style '' . it 's little more than a pretty picture book of impressive-looking rooms that integrate ht gear , and often in a laughable way . the text is fluffy , thowaway stuff that is irritating to read . the photos are very well done , but often include speakers and other gear set up with no unsightly cables . of course , without the unsightly cables , there 'd be no audio or video , either . i guess that 's the main thing that got to me -- if you 're going to show a setup with nice speakers and other gear that are out in the room , at least be honest about how to treat cables and make them look as good as possible . do n't just leave them out altogether . it 's insulting , and is foolish in a book that is supposedly about ht
