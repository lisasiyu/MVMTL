self-important i do n't understand why this book has the ratings of the other reviews here . it is a big disappointment . while this book has some interesting tips between the lines ( that 's why i give it 2 stars instead of one ) , it is merely a rambling of a self-important producer . the 303 `` solutions '' are at best 303 anecdotal stories . take solution # 96 `` how to shoot in a boat '' for example , it reads , in its entirety `` i always seem to get the jobs of shooting from some kind of moving vehicle . you 've read my exploits in the air and on the ground , but what about in the water ? shooting footage from a boat is a skill that someday i will master . not wanting to delve into jet skis , ski-dos , or speedboats , i will be discussing motorboats and sailboats . '' great solution chuck ! that really makes my filming much better . perhaps it would be possible to cut down this book into 99 tips and solutions , but in the style its been written it would still be painful to read and extract useful information . furthermore , the cover says , `` solve any video or edit problem in 10 minutes or less '' . not only is that untrue but also shows how silly this book is . the picture of a consumer dv camera also has nothing to do with the content , because chuck uses big professional equipment throughout this book , stuff that takes more than 10 minutes to just unpack by the way . i have n't found a good book to suggest as an alternative yet , but do n't waste your money on this one . try any other
