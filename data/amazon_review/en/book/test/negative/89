me me me me me generations of sad dingbats have stood on mountains waiting for some all-important 'end time ' , and when the predicted dates come and go , is anyone dissuaded ? of course not . they just re-interpret the same old ambiguities and come up with another date . `` no , really , this time we know we 've got it right . '' because books like this exploit the terminally self-centred , who want it all to be about 'me ' . `` i '' will be there when it all happens . it 's all for `` my '' generation . it 's all focused on `` me '' . lahaye and jenkins clearly capitalise on these feelings , as have generations before them . nobody ever went broke overestimating the gullibility of the human race
