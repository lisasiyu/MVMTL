a rhetorical bore ugh . this is an example of how academia has invaded and pillaged modern music writing . this woeful treatise on dai griffiths 's random thoughts on pop music and the question of `` classic status '' uses radiohead 's ok computer as an unfortunate jumping off point . most of the book is devoted to the study of pop music , the lexicon of recording conventions , and a labored breakdown of songs , not by sensible musical breaks , but awkwardly by minutes and seconds . reading this book is about as much fun as parsing a calculus equation . indeed it reminded me of why i am so glad to be out of school . it 's intellectual masturbation ( or wanking , i suppose ) of the worst kind . a choice quote : `` ... ok computer might in time be a focal point for historians of life at the close of the twentieth century . 'this is what was really going on . ' you want to know what 1997 felt like ? ok computer : tracks six - eight . pushed for time ? - track seven . '' track seven of course is `` fitter happier . '' yep . that song sums up the end of the 20th century , according to griffiths , and naturally , this record . point of fact , more time is spent discussing `` fitter happier '' in this book than for any other song on the album , a very strong indication of worthless dissection by a rhetorical bore . another great quote : `` thom yorke is less a songwriter to my mind than a peculiar thing , an 'idea-led word-producer , ' the words important as things in themselves rather than necessarily for their place in the song . '' that from the section in the book , `` words . '' and from the section , `` those pesky sound-effect openings and endings '' : `` i 'm not sure about those bits , though they certainly pad out the time . '' in other words , the sound design of each song 's opening , ending , and/or transitions exist merely to support the author 's argument that cd albums are typically longer than albums recorded for vinyl release . yes , those sonic orchestrations : time killers . ok computer is a remarkable album because of its ground breaking and remarkable music and lyrics . this is a solid basis for a book of this kind . instead , this book is built upon the argument : ok computer is an album made up of sound effects , music with key and tempo changes , words about animals , death , moods , and electronics , and is remarkable only in that it was recorded for a cd , not a vinyl lp . in fact , in time it will probably be remembered for being not very remarkable at all . a note to the editors of 33 1/3 : next time hire a writer who actually enjoys the album he/she is writing about
