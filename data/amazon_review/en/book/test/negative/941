conspiracy . no such thing according to this author . let 's remove it from the dictionary this book is incredible ! this author `` poo-poos '' any idea of conspiracy as if it 's in our deep inner mind . just notice he equates it with `` paranoid '' . does he think bin laden and his gang `` conspired '' ? well if you read one of mr . pipes other books , he certainly believes that , so i guess we can say he 's paranoid . conspiracies most likely are natural and normal , an abscence of conspiracy would be contrary to how individuals , nations and institutions work . mr . pipes ought to know that well . he 's a member of the council on foreign relations , an organization which was founded by j.p. morgan and has ties to the federal reserve bank , which is a private bank : not federal but a cabal of private bankers serving their own best interests . you ca n't join the cfr on your own -- you must be invited ! it 's a club of the elite , by the elite for the elite . every high ranking member of the bush admin is cfr : hayden , bush , cheney , rice , rumsfeld , powell , paulson , snow , etc , etc , also so is ms. clinton and many other ruling democrats . is this a coincidence , hardly ! compare mr . pipes book to tim carney 's `` the big ripoff '' , recently hosted on cspan book reviews and available on amzaon . tim gets close to the target by seeing the symptoms . mr . pipes writing of this book is highly suspect . one has to question his motives . it 's like the big bad wolf writing a book : how to raise chickens in a hen house and keep them safe . you would be better reading g. edward griffin 's book : creature from jekyll island-a second look at the federal reserve .
