shallow `` the denial of death '' is evasive and lacking in depth , not to mention excessively wordy . it could be seen , for instance , that death is a philosophical uncertainty . the denial of the absolute uncertainty of death ( and uncertainty in general ) could thus be a more profound form of denial . it could also be seen that a human being is as dead before his conception as after his death , and his prior state of death did not prevent him from emerging into life . death is then life-giving . further , a living being is made of 'dead ' matter - atoms as dead as those which make up rocks . where , then , does life begin and death end , and vice versa ? is there ultimately a difference between death and life ? in the end , this central notion lacks imagination ( at least you could credit freud with that ) , and has not been thoughtfully analysed , only assumed . by contrast , `` the human evasion '' is an unblinking analysis of the human condition and our psychological defenses against it .
