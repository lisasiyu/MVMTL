huh ? ? ? ? ? i like block and rodenbarr and have read many in the series . this one is a real letdown . recently authors appear to be having more and more problems bringing their tales to a satisfactory close . that 's true in spades in this book . at the end the author actually has bernie review what the police will say happened , what really happened , and what could have happened . it is all jumbled and unintelligible . the book ends with a classic showdown in a drawing room like some '30 's series . that 's no problem but the reader does n't really know who half the people are or why they are there . it 's just too much confusion for a story that 's pretty dull to begin with . the author does take time to praise bernie 's illegal immigrant doorman . apparently block feels that the high crime rate , astronomical high school drop out rate and appalling illigitimacy rate are nothing compaired with the joy that comes from rich manhattanites being able to find good menial help who know their place . people do n't get much dumber than upper west side liberals
