capable but strange gives many examples of weapons , most of which are useful . gives no/few examples of rings/armours/rods/staffs/shields does n't really think out a lot of the bonuses , also i question a lot of the penalties one has to take to use a legacy weapon . about the only table worth taking is 4-1 , or 4-2 . sure its a minus three to your saves , and a minus 2 to your attack power , and a whole slew of hp . the rest of them are so painful they are n't worth taking . also all the caster `` tables '' the ones your suppost to use if your a caster but losing caster levels and spell slots left and right does n't make any sense . no matter what feats and wizardry skills its not worth it . those could have been more thought out . also i question the fact that in some cases the lowest tables , a , d , and g. seem to be a lot better than the b , e and h tables just from the way they interact with things . i do fully agree that the top end capability you can add to your legacy item is quite powerful , the i table is filled with many useful things the you wish you could have picked two of them . what i wish/want was if they 're was some way to trade lower level slots to get you the capacity to get two i table skills . also some way to get either more or less slots if you take a less dangerous or more dangerous tables of the legacy grid . the rules for weapons and fighters/barbarians/paladins/rangers . are very well thought out and are very powerful . yet for anyone other class they need heavy modification to be workable . in a caster heavy campaign like the one i run and participate in its a very low value book
