boring ... not even a suspenseful finale i thought this book was incredibly slow . it never once peaked , nor did i find it all that engaging . normally there is usually some big finale , or event that grabs you - not here . the premise of the novel was pretty lame , and the `` bad guys '' were not exactly hard to figure out right away . all in all very disappointing
