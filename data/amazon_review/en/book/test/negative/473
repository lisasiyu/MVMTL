disappointing overall , i was not impressed by this rambling and disjointed book although ferguson makes some interesting points . the book is background to a british tv series involving ferguson , and it suffers very much from being written for that format . his basic argument is that the great wars of the 20th century tore apart the great multi-ethnic empires of great britain , russia , turkey , austria-hungary , and germany , unleashed ethnic tensions the empires had contained . this , he explains , is the reason for a lot of the violence of the century , as new nation states sorted out their ethnic identities with large-scale organized violence following . this is , indeed , a very fertile field and ferguson unearths the mass graves with relish . we are presented with the familiar parade of horribles -- kaiser bill , hitler , stalin , pol pot , etc. , and a huge section on the pogroms against the jews in central europe and the nazi extermination efforts . the narrative tends to jump around quite a bit , something i would attribute to the tv format of keeping viewers interested , but it 's a little disconcerting for armchair readers . but in the end , ferguson is unconvincing . i do n't think he has fully thought through his thesis here . unexplored is the question of why some 20th century wars of liberation , for example ireland 's , had low death rates , while the establishment of others like turkey were so murderous . there were bitter ancient ethnic and religious issues in both ireland and turkey , and yet both took different routes . also ignored are instances where threatened ethnic wars were largely averted , as in the case of canada after the british empire collapsed , and indonesia after the dutch withdrew . i found him also fighting a straw man . he beats down the theory that the wars involved class conflict , and insists ethnic divisions are more significant in explaining the carnage than class . perhaps soviet historians presented this view , but i thought 1989 resolved the debate about marxist interpretations of history . which brings up a final point . ferguson muses about why the last decade of the 20th century should be so quiet , compared to all that happened . i might think that the collapse of the soviet empire resolved the last issue of the wars of the 20th century by declaring another big loser .
