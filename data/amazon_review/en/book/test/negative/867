dated and biased i did not like this book very much . the author treats her subjects as if they were some sort of cockroach species under her idealistic american microscope . it is more accurate to say that this book is an account of how expatriates `` survive '' in ksa and not a true representation of the nation or its people . it is full of supercilious generalizations and patronizing commentary . it fully conforms to the biased view of muslim nations presented in the western media . i know many saudis and they are nothing like the examples presented in this book . to the contrary , they are some of the most hospitable and genuine people i have come accross . if you want the `` fox news '' version of saudi , by all means read this book
