argh very underwhelming . if you knew *nothing* , this might be a mediocre starting point , but there are so many other great resources on thyroid disease . you deserve better than this book . like is short . `` thyroid power '' or `` fat , fuzzy , or frazzled '' , mary shomon 's books and similar books are *crammed* with helpful scientific information . also `` mood cure '' is a great book worth checking out .
