boring ! i lent this book to my mil before i read it but told her not to tell me about it or her thoughts on it until after i read it . i could n't get passed the 2nd chapter . i found myself skipping pages that soon . i asked her if she liked it and she said she skipped a lot of pages also and found it to be very repetitive and boring . in my honest opinion it is one of the most boring books i have picked up . it just reads boring !
