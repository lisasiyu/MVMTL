overated based on the previous 5-star rave reviews written here , i decided to give this book a try , especially since it 's two books for the price of one . but when i opened up the book , i discovered that you do n't even get mackay 's complete book ; you get just the chapters relevant to finance/investing . because i was reading the book primarily for insight into trading/investing i thought i would make do . however there was very little of that to be found , and when it was found , it was typically written in verbose , archaic english , sandwiched between many pages of irrelevant historical minutea such as how exactly transactions were conducted in the 1700 's . there are a couple good gems , but nothing which has not been repeated in more modern books in much simpler language . e.g . the money game by adam smith or market wizards , or mindtraps by barach or any of tony oz 's books . there are sooo many good trading books out there to read that reading this was a complete waste of time
