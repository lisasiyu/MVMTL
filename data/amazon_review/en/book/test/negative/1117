the world is full of crashing bores ... although i agree with other reviewers who comment that the connection between this book and the smiths ' album is as thin as smoke , i was prepared to enjoy a well-written story just the same . unfortunately , i finished this wisp of a memoir wishing i had purchased the thirty-three and a third title about love 's `` forever changes '' instead . although i appreciated joe pernice 's occasionally clever metaphors , these were too few and far between , leaving us instead with the musings of the book 's exasperated protagonist , a teenage male infatuated with girls , alcohol , and new wave music . of course , even as ordinary a topic as that can inspire brilliant and funny writing . but it did n't here . at least not for me , as i found pernice 's protagonist niether interesting nor sympathetic . worse , the book 's exaggeration-as-a-primary-comedy-device ( however accurate to the speech patterns of perhaps many , many average seventeen year-olds ) is as unfunny as that dave barry essay . ( you know , the one he 's recycled for the past decade and a half about how computers are complex and children are expensive and men like watching sports and drinking beer ? ) the world is already full of crashing bores as it is . so why not save your time and money and listen to the smiths ' `` meat is murder '' while reading john kennedy toole 's deliciously dark `` a confederacy of dunces '' instead
