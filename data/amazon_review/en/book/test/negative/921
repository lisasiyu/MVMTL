only the worst of eco i have often joked that i would rather read umberto eco 's shopping list than many of the so-called popular novels . in this book , eco goes to prove me wrong . eco has written a book that is a struggle to read , not because it is deep , complex , and rich but because it is an utter bore . the story tells of the case of yambo , a rare-book dealer living in milan . yambo suffers a curious brain injury straight out of the man who mistook his wife for a hat . in his case , he can not recall anything that ever happened to him but he can remember every book he ever read . curious . but eco fails to do anything of much interest with this defect . for example , yambo runs a book studio and has a female assistant . yambo worries that perhaps he had an affair with her and wonders how she would react . he need not have worried , because like everyone else , she treats him with no mention of the past . yambo 's wife is perfectly accepting of his condition and yambo is able to bluff his way through conversations with any friends or acquaintances he meets . the end result is that nothing much happens and the book drones on . yambo decides to ride off into the country to visit his childhood home in hopes that something there may trigger his memories . yambo wonders around and gives us a detailed description of his bowel movements . `` a lovely snail-shell structure still steaming . '' i was underwhelmed . yambo wanders through the house finding secret rooms and reading old books . but none of this seems to go anywhere . in fact , it seems more like an excuse for eco to discuss ( although not in any detail ) , pre- and post-world war ii italian novels that eco fondly remembers . the book does pick up a little towards the final part but by then i just wished the book would end . i cared nothing for the main character of the story and found the whole enterprise an absolute chore to pull myself through . eco has done much better . if you are a true fan then go ahead and read the book to see that eco is , indeed , fallible . otherwise choose one of his other books instead
