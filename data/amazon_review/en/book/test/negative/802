he really thinks himself sincere , but his ego keeps getting in the way ! i really did love his collaboration with deepak on living beyond miracles , but i am beginning to grow tired of hearing the same stuff . if you want original and someone who is a gifted writer and humble man , deepak is so much more of a deep thinker . i get really tired of hearing wayne regurgitate other people 's work . it is as if he does n't have an original thought without quoting someone else 's work . and when he told the audience thank you for him being able to buy a house on maui , i was actually a little bit offended in that i felt sorry for the audience . ( i saw this on pbs ) at first , they laughed and then they actually looked sad after he said it . i have heard him do this in every single audio work i have listened to in some way or another , and it is truly full of the ego he tells us to get away from . i know we 're all human , but there always seems to be a sting in his work that shows how big his head really is . too bad ! without it , he could change so many more people 's lives
