disappointing this novel in dunning 's series about cliff janeway , bookseller sleuth , reads quite rough . it is an easy read because of the unusually large print for a trade paperback , but the plot is disjointed and leaves huge loose ends ( and no sign of a sequel ) . the central section is largely irrelevant to this story and unrequited ( but contains a commercial warning to be seriously heeded by booklovers ) . the good guys and bad guys are caricatures and too easy to spot ( with one very key exception ) , while cliff now is almost bad with simply too hostile a personality . finally , the ending is more hilariously awkward , quick , and sketchy than it is scary or satisfying . `` in a word , '' this novel is rough , unfinished , hasty , indulgent , a discourtesy by author and editor . dunnings first two janeway mysteries ( booked to die & the bookman 's wake ) were stunningly different , fresh , and invited me into a world of books , while his two o'clock eastern wartime was a fascinating radio/love story . the bookman 's promise was strange and now sign of the book is shockingly disappointing . if i happened to read this one first i doubt i would read anothe
