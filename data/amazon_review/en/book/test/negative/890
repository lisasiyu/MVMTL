shocked and disgusted i was exposed to this book in what i think is the most unfortunate way possible , it was read to my child in her public school kindergarten class . i was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a j for jesus , and that the red stripes were his blood , and if she loved jesus the white would wash it away . my child is five years old , and was disturbed by the whole thing . this book has no part of the christmas story in it , and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand . the illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate . the only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now i am even more communicative and vigilant about my child 's education and exposure , even in the school i trust with my child 's life and well-being
