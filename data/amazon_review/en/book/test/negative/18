stereotypes and unbelievable storyline much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on . sadly , from reading some of the reviews on amazon , mr. hiassen 's stereotypical , over the top books on the people of florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit florida after reading mr. hiaasen 's books . this is sad- that people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like twilly spree , clinton skink tyree and palmer stoat . where does he get these names ? during my 25 years in florida , the people i met had names like robert , jim , mary , chris , michael , etc . by the way , for those of you who think i am just a floridian with sour grapes- i have been a proud resident of the northeast for over 20 years . i just dislike stereotyping of groups of people . it causes prejeudice , misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred . read some christopher moore for your humor fix . he does n't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way , he makes them believable and fun
