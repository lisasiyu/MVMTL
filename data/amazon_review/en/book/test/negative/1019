for the coffee table , not the kitchen i got this as a gift from my son , since i had just visited tuscany last year and loved the food . i am an experienced gourmet cook . this book needed a test kitchen in the worst way . i tried two recipes : one for polenta ( as basic as pasta ) and a garbanzo bean bread . the proportions for both were totally wrong . the polenta balled up in the pan , and the `` flat bread '' was like a soft egg dish . i checked in one of my favorite chef cookbooks ( sheila lukins of silver palate fame ) and the proportions were very different for the polenta . the other recipe could n't find anywhere . i 'm donating this one to the library for the friends of the library sale .
