s. king horror or childish nightmare ? i was n't sure if this was from a s. king writing or some child night mare of a writing ! it 's obvious that any one can write then have that book published . only the most outrageous of imagination could come with this fairy tale type of fantasia . sorry , but the author is searching for the truth in the wrong place ! you know ?
