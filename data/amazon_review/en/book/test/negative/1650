obscure the truth `` let us be willing to test our spiritual experiences and evangelistic practices by scripture , '' pastor will metzger implores ( 51 ) . regrettably , pastor metzger was loathe to follow his own sound advice , opting instead to test his and the rest of christendom 's spiritual experiences and evangelistic practices by the standards laid down so long ago in the westminster confession of faith ( 1646 ) . and that is the main reason this latest revised and expanded edition of his ironically titled tell the truth ( downers grove , ill. : intervarsity press , 2002 ) remains a wealth of hyper-calvinistic misinformation . twenty-one years after the first printing of tell the truth ( hereafter , ttt ) , pastor metzger remains deeply troubled that increasingly cynical christendom is still attempting to evangelize the unbelieving world by showing only the attractive parts of the gospel message , and as a result are creating a vast army of god-damned ( literally ) pseudo-converts . pastor will , who began his career as a campus minister on the staff of intervarsity christian fellowship at the university of delaware the same year sir winston churchill departed for his eternal reward ( 1965 ) , believes a return to `` biblical evangelism '' can reverse the curse of `` me-centered '' evangelism ( 38 ) . and so ttt attempts to remedy the current sorry situation by explaining fully the content of the gospel ( part 1 : pp . 23-86 ) ; insuring that gospel message converts intellect , emotions , and will , i.e . the entire soul ( part 2 : pp . 87-111 ) ; explaining proper calvinistic soteriology ( part 3 : 112-158 ) ; and learning how to competently defend and communicate the faith ( part 4 : 159-207 ) . if for some reason the reader feels the need to have the main points of ttt rehearsed and/or get some idea how they might be put to good use in the real world , pastor metzger offers appendixes a-d ( pp . 208-259 ) . in pastor metzger 's considered ( read : reformed church tradition ) opinion , the numerous miracles performed by 1st century a.d. evangelists in the book of acts may be hanged , because there are really only two ways to proclaim christ : `` the airplane of christian witness has two wings : our lives ( conduct ) and our lips ( conversation ) '' ( 25 ) . strangely , pastor metzger offers no scriptural reference ( s ) to buttress this rather sweeping claim . the omission is particularly glaring given the bitterness of the complaint he voices in ttt 's introductory chapter : `` why is there such reticence to examine the biblical basis for methods of witness ( especially if they are the ones our church uses ) ? '' ( 17 ) . the irony is already palpable . just a few pages later pastor metzger folds and tucks away one of his two wings of christian witness , observing that numerous religious persuasions and philosophies will also produce positive , observable changes in conduct capable of impressing others ( 28 ) . but a few pages later the wing is reopened by pastor metzger , who now declares new converts may safely conclude they are truly saved when `` they see the fruits of a changing life '' ( 38 ) . fine . pastor metzger next reminds that `` in the book of acts we see the apostles as teachers -- reasoning , persuading , explaining -- involved in all sorts of teaching activity in order to communicate as much truth as possible to nonbelievers '' ( 34 ) . unfortunately pastor metzger omits the fact that secularists , mormons , jehovah 's witnesses , and numerous other cult leaders are also actively engaged as teachers -- reasoning , persuading , explaining -- involved in all sorts of teaching activity in order to communicate as much `` truth '' as possible to nonbelievers . the all-important difference is that unlike these false witnesses of god , the apostles were able to perform many wonders and signs ( acts 2:43 ) . those signs and wonders authenticated the apostles ' divine bona fides , just as they had previously authenticated jesus christ 's divine bona fides , and the divine bona fides of the true prophets ' of the ot before him . ( where exactly in the nt did pastor metzger read that god would go into semi-retirement immediately after giving the apostle john a revelation of the future ? where ? ) pastor metzger spends the rest of part one differentiating between `` me-centered evangelism , '' i.e. , spreading christianity by emphasizing the many personal benefits that will attend salvation , and `` biblical evangelism , '' i.e . five-point calvinism . `` conversion is both a turning from and a turning toward '' pastor metzger insists ( 67-68 ) . `` both law and love are basic ingredients in telling the gospel story '' pastor m. admonishes ( 71 ) . consciences need to be pricked . people must be made to understand that they do not have proprietary rights to their own lives , god does . pastor m. is not keen on encouraging new converts to make a public confession of their faith , ala romans 10:9-10 . he thinks they should be left alone to meditate on scriptures like isaiah 53 , psalm 51 , and galatians 2:20 ( 76 ) . apparently never having read acts 16:31 or philippians 2:11 , pastor m. declares `` there is not one exhortation in scripture to `accept christ as lord , ' '' ( 77 ) . on page 79 pastor m. lists three ways to know you are saved . the first is when you `` trust in the promises of god as being promises to you . '' the second is `` a change in your attitude and actions corresponding to the fruit of the spirit ( gal 5 ) and the marks of salvation ( 1 jn ) '' ( pastor m. ignores his earlier observation that new agers can also experience profound attitude changes ) . the third assurance of salvation is `` the inner witness of god 's spirit to your spirit . '' pastor m. does not unpack that statement , leaving it to the reader to exegete what he will from it . by marked contrast , the gospel writer mark recorded jesus ' decidedly different criteria for determining who is saved : and these signs will accompany those who believe : in my name they will drive out demons ; they will speak in new tongues ; they will pick up snakes with their hands ; and when they drink deadly poison , it will not hurt them at all ; they will place their hands on sick people , and they will get well . ( 16:17-18 ) . part two tries to distinguish professors of christianity from possessors of same in order to increase more of the latter . conversion is a process , not an event pastor m. cautions . christianity is not a self improvement plan ; it is god 's method for restoring you to fellowship with him . converts need `` to ask god for faith , '' since `` they are not choosing to be saved '' ( 91 ) . pastor m. then presents a short , biased analysis of the age-old arminian-calvinism debate on soteriology , concluding that the five points of calvinism are `` orthodox theology ... in need of further filling out '' ( 109 ) . part three , `` wholly by grace , '' is largely a continuation of the calvinist rant begun in part two . pastor m. admits the arbitrary election of a relative handful to heaven and the overwhelming majority to hell is not fair , but hey , god is sovereign , and he would have been justified to throw everyone in hell , not just almost everyone . humanity 's free will has been disabled by sin , and now it can not choose anything but sin ( if that is true , and doing right is not an option , how could sin then be termed a `` choice ? '' ) . `` god hides the truth from some people . he does n't reveal himself or jesus to them . why ( lk 10:21-22 ) ? '' ( 146 ) . pastor m. misinterprets that passage in luke to mean intelligent people are tricked into unbelief by a vengeful or capricious god , as opposed to them being deserving victims of their own misplaced self-confidence . part four begins by enumerating some of the difficulties philosophical pluralism creates for successful evangelism . pastor m. defends christian exclusivity by referring to john 14:6 : jesus answered , `` i am the way and the truth and the life . no one comes to the father except through me . '' pastor m. ignores the fact that jesus ' comments were offered to his own disciples at a private gathering , not addressed to the masses in general during a public sermon . pastor m. observes all religious faiths save christianity require its adherents `` to do something '' ( 165 ) . pastor m. apparently has not noticed that repenting , confessing , baptizing , trusting , etc. , are verbs . pastor m. believes the evangelistic value of christian apologetics is limited . `` god 's chosen instrument in conversion is his word , not our reasoning ability '' ( 169 ) . in that case we can only pity that great swath of humanity that was never taught how to read , or could never afford to purchase a copy of scripture , or never had the word translated into their native tongue . pastor m. soon changes his mind about god 's chosen instrument in conversion . `` prayer for others is the supreme god ordained method in evangelism '' ( 178 ) as usual , pastor m. offers no scriptural support for his emphatic , sweeping statement . he goes on to say `` evangelism is asking the right questions '' ( 189 ) , but once again cites no nt anecdote to support his contention . besides asking all the right questions , the christian evangelist also needs to make sure an unbeliever understands `` the impossibility of ... exercising faith on their own '' ( 203 ) . fine . in summary , tell the truth proffers a pneumatology , a soteriology , and a strategy for evangelism that seems alien to those described in the book of acts . when all is said and done , ttt is hoisted by its own petard : `` ... to be unwilling to evaluate our evangelism in the light of the bible is to not take scripture seriously '' ( 19 ) .
