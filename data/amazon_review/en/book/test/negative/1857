not bright enough this is one of my favorite authors . i could hardly wait to open burning bright and get lost in london of the 1700 's . well , lost i got ! each page was more and more boring . i read 3/4th of the book and donated it to the library . after reading the other reviews i am glad i didnt finish the book and be completely disappointed with the weak ending .
