yes , read the whole thing ! i do n't see how you can isolate `` the grand inquisitor '' chapter from the novel in which it is situated , the brothers karamazov . i think that knowing who is telling the story , who he is telling the story too , what the story means to each of these people , and what the consequences of what the grand inquisitor have to say , are all important ; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor ! ! ! ! ! ! ! my suggestion : buy the brothers karamazov instead of this . it 's excellent
