good beginner guide , but not much more this is actually an excellent introduction to short term trading . everything is well explained and pleasantly written . day trading 101 . however , it 's not really marketed as that , so it gets 2 stars . if you read this book and much of it is a revelation , you need to spend the next 4-6 months doing research , reading , and paper trading . if you were to start trading based on what 's in this book you would lose your shirt . it 's akin to a book on football that explaines the field , how far apart the lines are , where the end zone is , who the players are , what the positions do , what a pass is , the three things that can happen when you pass , etc . it would even have a few basic plays , the `` long pass '' , `` student body right '' , etc . everything you need to know about football , except how to actually play and win . basic , well explained information is what this book has . and if you 're just getting into trading it 's a worthwhile read . it 'll give you a foundation that will help you understand more advanced books like secrets of an underground trader or technical analysis of the financial market ( murphy ) . but even the lack of advanced technical stuff is not really a strike against toni 's book . the technical books really are just research books for helping you design your own system . they are practically outdated as soon as they come out and even if they 're not , it 's a dangerous thing to rely on someone else 's system . you need to design a system that you can trade and you 're comfortable trading . if you ca n't do this , no book can help you . which leads to the main reason i gave the book 2 stars . lack of any real discussion of trading psychology . the book you need to buy if you 're going to trade is reminiscences of a stock operator . it 's 80 years old and explains the mentality of trading as well as any book out there . the psychology of risk is another good book . understanding what it takes to trade and determining if you have that is critical . as is understanding if you can make split second decisions when it 's $ 40k of your own money on the line . toni devotes a few pages to it , including a silly 'psychology quiz ' which is probably the same quiz they use in the back of cosmo to determine whether you 're an agressive lover or a passive one . she also devotes a page at the end of each chapter to 'self-help ' tips . it 's true that you ca n't design a system for yourself if you do n't know yourself , so these are helpful . at the end of the day tho , they wo n't explain what it takes mentally to be a trader . personally , i find yoga to be a good way to clear my head in the morning and get focused . but it 's a means to end . not the end itself . such are the self-help tips in the book . if you do n't know what you 're trying to achieve , they are only so useful . so if you 've read several books on trading you can skip this . there are much more advanced books out there . if you 're new to trading and are looking for a well written book explaining the basics and a bit more , this is worth the money . but it 's not a classic or something you 'll find yourself referring to as the years go by
