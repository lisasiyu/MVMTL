he needs to learn what a `` proof '' is this textbook relies on more handwaving arguments than my quantum textbook ! griffiths seems to be under the impression that he is an astounding mathematician and the reader can barely integrate . the `` proofs '' of almost every key concept are either fleshed out in `` well suppose ... then this might happen ... '' or altogether left to the reader . it was a fun challenge to actually write a proof for a lot of them , too ... maybe griffiths should have tried it when he wrote the book . if the reader does every single problem in the book , he or she may have a mid-undergrad level understanding of basic e & m . very little relativity , and no quantum mechanical aspects are covered ( if i remember correctly )
