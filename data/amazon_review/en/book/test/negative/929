a very dull , dry piece mr hibbert writes in a very dull , dry tone and i found it incredibly hard to be engaged in the story . he confuses the reader with time , people and his interpretation of what elizabeth was like as a woman and a queen . i only read this because i had to ( for school ) . if you do n't have to read it , then do n't ! it will bore you to death
