literary masturbation i picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale . i paid one american buck for it , which was about 100 cents too much . it 's obvious from the start that rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary . probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings , imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it , in order to decipher his blather . i would recommend any of john steinbeck 's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel , simply to clean their mental palate . dumpster fodder .
