no new information this book offers nothing to someone remotely familiar with environmental issues . it might be a mediocre read for a beginner , but if you 're already familiar with overpopulation , mismanagement of resources , etc , you will get nothing out of this book . it is incredibly repetitive and it lacks insight and depth . do n't waste your time .
