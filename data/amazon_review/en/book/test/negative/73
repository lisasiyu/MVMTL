moves far too slowly this book is about a man named ray atlee whose father has just died , leaving $ 3 million in unexplained cash . someone else knows about the money . the three major questions for the book to answer are : 1 ) where did the money come from ? 2 ) who is the mystery person ( or people ) trying to get it ? 3 ) what will ray do with it ? i have reached page 261 in this book , and none of these questions have been answered . ray has moved the money around , been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere . 261 pages in , all i know is where the money did n't come from . this is a legal thriller that does not thrill . the pacing is deadly dull and i keep waiting , waiting , waiting for something to happen and nothing does . finally i threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when i realized how close to 300 pages i 'd gotten with nothing happening . i do n't know why i even gave the book this much of a chance . nothing bad has happened to him , and even though three million is at stake , none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it . if they were really following him as much as it 's alluded to in the book , they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash . he spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car , for god 's sake ! i may finish it one day , but as of now i just do n't care about the money or the characters who are after it . not grisham 's best , by a long shot
