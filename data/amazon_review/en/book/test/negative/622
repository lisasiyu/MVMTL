very disappointing this is the story of cassie , who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young indian policeman who just arrived in la . cassie suffers from amnesia and we do n't know what brought her there , until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife . this is by far the most disappointing of picoult 's books , and i 've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers . cassie is amnesic , yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened . the story goes back and forth between the present , the past , the memories , and leaves readers lost in the middle . i was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending . chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion . what is frustrating is that it takes picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious . i also found cassie to be unreliable and unappealing , let alone her husband alex , a massive egocentric . the story was very confused , mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in africa , with anthropology , indian legends , domestic violence , alcoholism , amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused . if you want a superb story of domestic violence , read black & blue by anna quindlen . if you want a good picoult book , read the pact or my sister 's keeper , but definitely not picture perfect
