weak women -- an anne tyler speciality this is only the second anne tyler book i 've read and i 'm not impressed . the book was depressing . i had hope as the book progressed that the main character would & quot ; triumph & quot ; over her circumstances but instead she subsumed her own dreams for her husband 's wants and needs . anne tyler implies that this is a noble sacrifice but i thought it was weak . she should have left her loser husband
