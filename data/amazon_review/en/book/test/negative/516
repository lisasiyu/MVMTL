disapointing this 84 page book is evenly divided between intstructions on how to build a brick oven and recipes for baking in it . i have not tried the recipes . i made an impulsive purchase of this book because i have been interested in building a brick oven for some time . i mistakenly thought that i would gain some insights and practical tips that were missing from the bread builders by daniel wing and alan scott . i did not . there is , in my opinion too little detail in this book to actually construct a quality oven .
