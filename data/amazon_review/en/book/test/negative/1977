a savagely racist work this epic work is currently being referenced repeatedly as a cautionary tale of what the u.s. should be careful of in iraq . superlatives like `` history at its best '' , `` an all-time classic '' and `` superbly accurate '' are being tossed around carelessly to describe alistair horne 's history . in fact , it remains a remarkably racist work loved by state department officials and neocons alike - similar , but not quite on par with , the racial hatred on display in that other state department favourite , the arab mind , by raphael patai . in this work , alistair horne describes in gory detail atrocities committed by the fln , or algerian nationalist rebels , while skimming over far worse atrocities committed by the nice white-guy french . atrocities are not to be ranked , measured , and compared , but horne 's bias becomes transparent when he describes in detail and over several pages the killing of 100 french - a tragic and ugly incident , no doubt - but then blithely mentions in passing , without flesh-and-blood detail , that the french killed 6,000 algerians in response . six thousand ! most of these were summary executions of unarmed prisoners , a common french tactic , and many thousands of the civilians murdered were toddlers and elderly women . this is but a glimpse into the sick mind of alistair horne , who manages somehow to see the french as victims . he deplores the damage to the french psyche caused by their torture of thousands of algerian civilians , without once considering the damage the torture had on algerians , the actual people being tortured . horne makes cursory mentions of barbaric acts committed by the french but never draws the conclusion that french society itself may have been perverse , twisted , or morally sick . yet , he has no hesitation in expressing that algerians ' behaviour proves that they are somehow subhuman , or less human , than europeans . in short , this is a good book to read to understand how once upon a time the french , like the americans today , felt themselves infallible , civilised , and racially superior to arab and other `` primitive '' peoples . it is an illusion that must be fought . another reviewer on this site mentions that horne 's book covers `` islamic terrorism '' , but no such phrase is to be found in his book . contrary to what most americans believe today , so-called `` islamic terror '' is not an eternal and everlasting feature of the modern world ; in 1977 , when horne wrote this work , there had yet been no iranian revolution , no soviet invasion of afghanistan ( and hence no al-qaida ) , no israeli occupation of south lebanon ( and hence no hizbullah ) , and no israeli-supported creation of hamas as a counterweight to the secular plo . therefore , no such concept of `` islamic terrorism '' existed in horne 's mind or in any other person 's mind in 1977 . it is a failing of the human mind to write current events into history ; american journalists employ it as their favourite agitprop tactic .
