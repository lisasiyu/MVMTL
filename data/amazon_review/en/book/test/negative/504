worset movie ever i ca n't stand this movie , it 's one of the worset . the acting is horrible , it 's dark , gloomy , and so boring . it 's fun to watch and make fun of it , but thats about all . i do not recommend it , i would give it zero stars if it was possible . the child actress `` mary '' and then the older grown up `` mary '' actress is n't suitable , she does n't even look like she could have been the same person or type , how awful ! watch another version , this one is a waste of time and money !
