read because it considered a classic the book is written about an empire in the future . i 'm not really sure why asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer , which is a dying system of government , instead of a democratic republic . i know this is nit-picking , but i did n't like this book . apparently , the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics . anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician , as i do , knows that it 's difficult to predict what 's going to happen in anyone 's life tomorrow , much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics . this book is intellectual worship , which is something i ca n't stand . intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else , so feel they should rule over everyone else , if only you would listen to them . this idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude . this smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable . another idea that 's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable . if this guy was so smart as to predict , with a high degree of accuracy , the downfall of civilization , and the rising of a new one , along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through , why was n't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization . surely , with his predictive ability people would listen to him , but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason . and asimov is a mediocre writer . the story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed . i read this book because as a sci-fi fan , i felt obligated
