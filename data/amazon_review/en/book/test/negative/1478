one sided yes , there are flaws in kinsey 's statistics and sometimes his methods were unethical . these two problems still exist today . but i think this book goes too far . there are no references to back up the `` facts '' . it was written by a journalist with no credentials except that she is on a lifetime crusade to repress people 's sexuality . it is published by ascension press , a religious publisher . of course it is going to denounce his work . this publisher represents people who live by the bible and kinsey 's research does not follow the bible . so why does that make it wrong ? i would n't recommend this book to anyone with a brain .
