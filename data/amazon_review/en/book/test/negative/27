hannity and this book are an example of nonthinking american lives . hannity receives his talking points every day from the rnc , and then repeats them like the summoner from `` canterbury tales , '' repeating his two or three latin phrases . hannity 's phrases : - liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm 's way . - liberals do n't want to defend america and fought homeland security every step of the way ( when it was bush who fought it ) - howard dean hates republicans , he is unhinged , so is hillary , al gore , john kerry , and every republican except for ben nelson and joe lieberman . - osama bin laden was offered up to clinton on a silver platter . ( never happened ) so , as al franken says , hannity knows 11 facts , all of which are outright lies , or misrepresentations , so please do n't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows . do n't waste your money on this book - it , and he , are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other . he is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut , begotten on his listeners ' backs
