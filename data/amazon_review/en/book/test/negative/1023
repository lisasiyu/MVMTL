do not believe other reviews ! ! ! i read all the reviews before purchasing this book and they are totally wrong ! ! this is by far the worst cookbook i ever bought . for starters the cover is the end of the color pages . the whole thing is mono-tone with no color what-so-ever . the recipes consist of items that an everyday working mom couldnt find or afford ! like swordfish , lamb , tampanade sauce , kasseri and gorgonzola cheese , etc . to name a few . of all the recipes , i think i would maybe only try 3 and they are similar recipes to those i can get off the internet for free . in addition several recipes have a sauce that goes with it and it never gives the sauce recipe on the same page . in fact it doesnt even tell you where to find the recipe . at the end of the book you discover the `` sauces '' finally ... i am re-listing this book which i got less than 8 hours ago to resell ... horrible..
