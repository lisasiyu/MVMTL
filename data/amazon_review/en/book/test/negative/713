reviews better than it reads an unreadable book . bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole . to use delillo 's garbage theme : it was like finding litter on a sidewalk . each piece once meant something , but who knows what . i finished it because i had read so many good reviews that i thought there must be something worthy in it . sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end . not in this case . torture for 800 pages and then poof ! delillo tidies everything up in an epilogue . nice scenes and nice sentences and big ideas do n't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read . it was my first delillo book and it will probably be my last
