stand down samples taken from wtc steel now confirm ( soon to be released by professor steven jones of byu and five other universities ) thermate was used in the wtc towers to take them down . this meshes with the global collapse times of both towers ( and 7 wtc ) and the eyewitness reports that day from firefighters , police , tenants and workers who said bombs were in the towers . not only do we have dispicable people in government who , of course , knew this all along , but the u.s. media knew it too . soon both will be out of employment
