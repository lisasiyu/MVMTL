you are n't seriously considering buying this ... are you ? considering that it 's now been a year after the title date , and no comet has struck the earth , let alone greece ( during the olympics , yet ) , this book is a flop . put a prediction and date in your title , trot out nostradamus , and you may find that your audience expects results . to quote marvin the martian : `` where 's the kaboom ? there was supposed to be an earth-shattering kaboom ! '' . do n't worry , i 'm sure welch will write another book with amended predictions . it gets a whole star because it 's fun to check off the misses on major predictions as they pass
