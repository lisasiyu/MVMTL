not that great i was surprised when i took this class that i did not like this book . all of my epid profs highly recommended this text . you have to flip back and forth when you are doing the problems because they list the sas output that you need once in one chapter . i know it saves space , but this can get maddening . i did not find the examples clearly written at all-the lack of fit test , and some of the stuff about partial f tests could have used a few more sentences . no , i can not write a glowing review of the text , but the only reason for the second star is because i also had a terrible instructor for this course . perhaps if dr. kleinbaum had taught this to me , i would have a different perspective of this book . however , i was pretty much teaching myself this material , and this book is not designed for that .
