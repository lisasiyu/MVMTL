one of the worst ... i was excited when i saw this book with such a title . but it turned out to be one of the worst ( popular math book ) i have read in the last few years . then i read the review by sporkdude on november 7 , 2004 ( thanks sporkdude ! ) . he made some very good suggestions ( that we should ignore all the odd chapters but a handful of pages , if not ignore the whole book at all ) . i gave the book a second chance , but it just once again confirmed that it 's a really badly written book . i can tell you why . on page xiii of the book , the auther claims that `` i do n't believe the riemann hypothesis can be explained using math more elementary than i have used here , so if you do n't understand the hypothesis after finishing my book , you can be pretty sure you will never understand it . '' is it true ? what i am sure is that you will not understand what riemann hypothesis is after finishing this book . the author never tried to get to the point , or i would say he was incapable in doing so . even worse , you would n't be able to grisp a big picture of what the hypothesis was all about , as the author jumped around too much , that you 're not sure what it 's all up for . together with his tedious writing style ( e.g . he likes to throw you with some random decimal numbers upto a hundred digits ) , it wo n't take you too long to realize it 's just a waste of time to keep on reading this book . it is `` amazing '' that such a book would get an average of 4.5 stars by 62 reviewers . if it was your very first popular math book and you found it delightful , i can assure you that there 're some a lot better popular math books out there waiting for you to explore
