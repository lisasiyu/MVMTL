disappointing like `` jurassic park '' , this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters . my reasons for such an accusation : 1 . crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts . and while these can be quite interesting , they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline ( dan brown , for instance , is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity ) . as a result , the book comes off as slow and stumbling . 2 . the plot is n't all that interesting to begin with . ( vengeful gorillas ? talking gorillas ? misanthropic gorillas ? come on . ) 3 . the book 's ending is utterly terrible . 4 . cricton 's writing is weak , and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing . sorry , michael , but this book just did n't do it for me
