not a book for believers this is not a book for believers . anyone of the jewish , christian or muslim faith should not pick up this book because you will be seriously offended . mr. kirsh takes several biblical passages out of context to use in his argument . his attitude towards anyone who believes is devoutly religious and believes strongly in the words of the bible is extreemly condeceding . he says & quot ; if you read the bible with open eyes and an open mind & quot ; . therefore presuposing anyone who does not see things his way is narrow minded . it was not until i got trough the first 30 or so pages did i realise that none of the & quot ; rave reviews & quot ; he received were from any clergy or religious orders . further i realised that mr. kirsch views are not stated out in the open . you do n't see his perjorative view towards the bible , moses and god until after you 've got into reading the book . i would only recomend this book to aetheists and others who are contemptuous of the bible and the above faiths
