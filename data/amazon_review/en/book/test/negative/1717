dostoyevsky at his very worst do n't waste your time reading this book - this book is awful ! this book was supposed to be so good , according to the other reviews , and it 's definitely not a good novel . in fact , this is by far the worst novel i have read in my life . i think one of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head - most of this book just seems like random writing and ultimately it has no real purpose for carrying forward the plot line . indeed , it definitely seems like he was just trying to meet a word count for the publisher . the edition of the book i read was slightly over 700 pages , and it could have easily been reduced to 300 without affecting in any way the plot line . thus the reader is left to swallow 400 pages of pointless writing that just seems like `` waffling '' to mention the term used in england to describe writing that leads you no where . not only that , but the 300 pages devoted to actually explaining the plot are not that interesting anyway . the plot line of the novel is incredibly implausible ; a prince who is an `` idiot '' but on occasions does n't seem like such an idiot after all and who suffers from a mysterious illness of `` idiocy '' that could not be labelled as an actual illness by modern medicine . moreover , one of the principal characters in the novel , aglaia yepanchin supposedly is madly in love with the prince while at the same time making fun of him in a very rude way right in front of his nose - am i the only one here who thinks this is just a little implausible ? and then just to make matters worse , and as an appetizer after having to swallow 650 pages of horrible writing , near the end of the novel dostoyevski puts in the mouth of the prince two full pages of the most outrageous slander against the catholic religion i have read in my life . supposedly , according to dosteyvski , atheism comes from the catholic religion - certainly dosteyevski does n't hide his hatred for the catholic faith . even atheists would laugh at such an absurd proposition
