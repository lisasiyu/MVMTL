known as america 's poet , whitman is not poetic walt whitman 's life 's work is his `` leaves of grass '' , enlarged over the years with additional poems . regarded as america 's poet , whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s , encompassing both the `` manifest destiny '' ideology of the pre-war , through the reconstruction period of us history . the poems are diverse and upbeat . the language , for the most part , is clear and easy . nevertheless , like most poetry today , the poems are so little different from prose , except in the presentation into lines . very few poetic devises are used . one may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry . but , in comparison to rhyhming verse by longfellow , frost , byron , browning , or shakespeare , current poetry appears meaningless . although a classic , `` leaves of grass '' offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology . none of his poems are memorable . not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature . i give two stars to the work , simply because i must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation . whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie , `` dead poet 's society '' ; so , the reputation of the work must be quite impressive , though it beats me how that is
