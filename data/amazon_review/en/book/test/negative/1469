welcome back my friends , to the show that never ends ... `` when will it end ? ? never ! muwhahahahaha ! '' review contains spoilers***** first off , up until this point , i found the series moderately entertaining ( especially the 2nd book ) . granted , in every book , there are certain aspects of jordan 's redundant writing that are very annoying . for instance , the childish , and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters . realistically , in a time period like that , if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series , they would get a good `` thumping '' and be forced to learn from their mistakes ( as would anyone really ) . instead , the men grovel like slaves around the women . it 's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic . even in fantasy , there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race . hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational , practical decision . there is hardly any logic here , and when someone who is supposedly `` wise '' speaks up , its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should , and probably does know . most of the so-called `` intellectual '' sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know . human characteristics aside , jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery ( clothing , geography , battle fields etc ... ) hardly anything is left out . i suppose this is good , if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that jordan has created . but here we are ... at the 5th book . i hate to say it , but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books . sometimes , it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another . jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books . this can either be as an excuse for such a long series , or its just basically poor writing . i 'm a little undecided on that . this book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had : 1 . most of the men ca n't think for themselves ( however there are a number of characters that i do like allot . uno , julian , matt , asmodean , lan , thom , loial ( who is n't even in this one..go figure ) what happened to elays ? ? uhg.. 2 . the female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter 3 . rand 's increase in the one power , is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into . it all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the dragon reborn ( end of book 1 i believe ) . it takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up , and take action . this is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series . rand attains the 'sword that can not be touched ' . a weapon that can level cities ... what does he do ? shoves it into the floor at the stone of tear , and scampers off into the woods for another adventure . wow..smart huh ? 4 . the forsaken are scheming as usual . it 's a mystery to me that they were picked by the dark one . powerful as they may be , they 're mostly stupid , too paranoid , and un-trustworthy of one another . it would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate rand . they could . everyone knows they could . but they do n't ... frustration level ever increasing ... this series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time . jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time , then shove them off , with hardly a word of goodbye . something that i must point out is the way jordan decides to kill off , or deal with the `` evil '' characters . this whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance , and fear of death . i believe it is wrong to kill off so many `` evil '' characters at one time . characters that have potential are eliminated . and yes ... asmodean . here comes my biggest gripe of all.. i rather liked asmodean , his character was interesting , and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the `` evil '' side , to `` good '' side ( even if it was un-willingly ) . he does provide a lot of insight for rand . if i was a forsaken , i would defiantly cross over to rand 's side , it only makes sense . but ... instead of keeping asmodean alive and allowing him to help rand with his great struggle ... he 's killed off at the end of the book . right there , jordan drops a huge amount of story potential , and trades it for the same , un-inventive , one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains . then rand goes on to kill rhavin . another interesting character wasted . lanfear has also been killed ( as far as we know ) . again , another interesting character wasted . i could care less about moraine . after the first book , her character is basically rendered useless , and is completely unneeded . all in all , jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters ( hurin , ingtar , elays etc.. ) and keep the boring , immature ones . ( nynaeve , egwene , elayne , aviendha etc ... ) the series is simply too long , and i 'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded . if lord of chaos is as bad as this one , i 'm burning my collection and sending the remains to jordan 's house . so , to those who are in the midst of this series like i am , i say to you ; 'welcome back my friends , to the show that never ends ' .
