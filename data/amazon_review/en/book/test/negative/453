don '' t waste your time this book really is an insult . it 's `` lesson '' and `` assignments '' are horrible . they ask you to research in magazines different lighting effects that you think were used in his book . in a field where doing is truly the best learning experience this book is not worth the paper it was printed on . check it out from a library if you must but you will shortly find it is an insulting read
