just the tip of the iceberg in order to maintain the legal status of your corporation , you need to pass very specific resolutions and keep very specific records . i had hoped for a `` cookbook '' for the legal steps required to set up and operate my corporation , but this is not it . the info on corporate structures is very basic and general - you could easily find this level of detail on the web . that 's my primary complaint with this book ... it mentions what you must do , but does n't give you the specifics of how . instead of this book , i recommend you : ( 1 ) get the *basics* from your lawyer or accountant ( or even doing some research on the web ) ( 2 ) buy the corporate minutes book by anothony mancuso instead of this book
