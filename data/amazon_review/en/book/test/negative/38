a pale copy it seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of lucas davenport . i feel that he wants to transplant the best of davenport to a new hero.if so , he failed . if that is the case , he failed . there are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us . worth to read if you can not fall asleep ; after some half a dozen pages , you can . how sad..
