save your money this book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are . for one , i do n't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water , which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists . the author also does n't mention the importance of live rock . in fact , he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks ! sure , you might be able to get away with not using live rock , but it wo n't be worth it in the long run . also , i do n't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations . one more thing , the book lists an air stone as essential equipment , but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep ! if you have enough movement of water at the surface , you should get sufficient gas exchange . there is , however , one thing the book does get right : its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer . this book is easy to understand , but you wo n't be getting the best information
