history buff the author could have added so many details that were factual and actual events and , yet , were so compelling and riveting . this book lacked substance and depth . you do n't really experience the life or the personal conflicts that played out in the french court . it was also too sympathetic to marie antoinette and highly unbelievable . there were also so many missing pieces that could have explained more clearly what led up to the revolution . i know this is a work of fiction but the true historical events and figures that took place were much more interesting than all the fictional events and characters the author created .
