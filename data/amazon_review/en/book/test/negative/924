this play shows its age this play caused a great controversial stir when it was first performed in 1965 . this is supposed to be a classic example of an existentialist and absurdist play . it was pinter 's first stage play and the one that made his reputation . although it was very daring and shocking in 1965 , the play has aged and lost its freshness and original power , in my opinion . there are many other portrayals of dysfunctional families that have retained their freshness and power -- such families have been a mainstay of drama from the time of the ancient greeks . shakespeare and even fairy tales have built themselves around exploring the dark and abusive aspects of the family dynamic . so pinter 's on to nothing new or radical here . the script as such is blatantly misogynist . the one female role , ruth , has no lines that sound human -- she comes across as a stilted android . ruth is so obviously not a real woman but a male projection of lust , fear , possession , hate , and paranoia . i recently saw this play performed in manchester , uk , and have to wonder why people still think this play , with all its misogynist posturing , is relevant to a contemporary audience . if it were just a black absurd comedy , it might have worked better for me , but pinter seems to be aiming at something deeper and more menacing yet ca n't seem to make up his mind if we 're supposed to be feeling sympathy with his characters or taking them ( and the underlying meaning of the play ) seriously or not
