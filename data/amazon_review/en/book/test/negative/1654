women good , men bad women in america are so fun to be with , so wonderful , and so full of life , it 's sad the men in this country have n't taken notice of them . this book points the finger where it is needed most - at the menfolk ! while we do face a 43 % divorce rate and a 17 % separation rate in this country with 65+ % of those divorces and separations initiated by the wives of those marriages , and women are overwhelmingly favored to receive alimony and child support over men in family court , this should be of no concern to men . oh , and also if you have a woman in your home or are married to her for a short while , you may be liable for a huge amount of palimony or alimony . oh , and evidentiary due process is not required for you to be convicted of domestic violence in family court . you may end up losing your children , house , bank account and freedom if your wife decides she is bored and wants to `` move on '' . uhhh , never mind ...
