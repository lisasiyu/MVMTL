overpriced . terrible layout . this is a really thin book , and for the price , the production value is terrible . the graphic design , and poor layout , takes a lot away from the information of the book . page after page , you wonder if this recent publication was from the 1980s . the information was light , and just skimmed over details . there was way too much emphasis on analog . there are other search softwares out there . the case studies were nice , but no real insight was given . overall - it 's an overpriced fluff book . could be summaried in 5 pages
