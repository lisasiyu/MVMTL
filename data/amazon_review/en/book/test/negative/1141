book in need of an editor ! i ordered this book because i am extremely interested in the untold stories of the partition of india even though the reviews told me not to . i wished i had heeded the advice . the book is incredibly repetitive -- to the point of being unreadable . i learned very little . not worth the time to read or money to purchase .
