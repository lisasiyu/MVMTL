`` evolution of the stone '' of all the books which dominated the discussion of analytic philosophy in the 90s , john mcdowell 's *mind and world* was actually the one which most nearly brought home the prize of great philosophy without naughty bits : and this most nearly in the form of an inversion of lukacs , `` reification and the consciousness of the professoriat '' . his early oxgaffes having been forgotten , mcdowell was here free to offer an `` unpolitical '' account of contemporary thought drawing heavily from classic works . but if the result is not quite robert brandom 's linguistic leninism , the reader ends up getting a story about `` who 's to be master '' that has a little too much excitement squeezed into mcdowell 's oscillating queries . much as brandom makes a hash of the relationship between formal semantics and `` inferentialism '' , mcdowell 's account of hegel 's relationship to *bildung* does not even crib gadamer 's `` historically effective consciousness '' as a corrective to his `` uncritical '' eudaemonism ( those interested in hegel 's intellectual relationship to aristotle would do well to look at alfredo ferrarin 's book instead ) -- and the excitement one is forever waiting on with respect to sellars is pressed into service for a thoroughly unserviceable treatment of hegel 's remark `` in thinking , i am free , because i am not in an other '' -- very much the product of stoic philosophy , and very much militating against the `` therapeutic '' story about non-conceptual content directly following ( with apologies rendered to peacocke for his rather more serviceable story ) . is any of this that objectionable ? no , and although mcdowell 's work was very much `` in a vogue '' for a while ( i.e. , served upon you according to his lecture specifications ) this ( as well as his essays ) is fine reading concerning stylistics with respect to thoughts of the form `` whereof we can not speak ... '' but none of it is as thoroughly `` wittgensteinian '' as presented , and if mcdowell can still coherently be accused of rendering a disservice to that philosopher this heavily syncretist work must be counted as one such . i expect this is not the case , however , and as such can not in good conscience recommend this book to interested readers : if you are in the grip of a worry , perhaps you should stay there , and if you feel differently perhaps being notified of your pseudo-problems will not help overmuch . something of a lecture-stuffer
