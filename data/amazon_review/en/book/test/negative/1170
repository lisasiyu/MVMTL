thoroughly disappointing i have to say i am a huge pkd fan , and have read just about all of his books . and before you dismiss this review , know that i read and enjoyed valis and the divine invasion , precursors to this book , the third in the series . but , sadly , this book just was not the vintage dick classic that ubik , or a scanner darkly was . in fact , i was disgusted with this book , and to date , i have loved every one of dick 's books , even the more obscure ones ( galactic pot healer ) . though ubik and my personal favorite now wait for last year had a strong , cohesive plot littered with welcome digressions and departures , i ca n't help thinking that transmigration was just one long digression lacking any sort of structure , and without the strong and interesting characters in dick 's other books . with a slew of obscure references to various operas , epic poems , and other pieces of the impotent intellectual vangaurd , it seemed dick was trying to prove to us his cultural superiority and sophistication . and that is not the philip k. dick i know and admire . i suppose if you feel compelled to read everything that dick has written , then read this , but do yourself a favor and borrow it because it is not a book that you will want to re-read
