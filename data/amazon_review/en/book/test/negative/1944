less content than an average web page this book has 30 pages of obvious and worthless information . the book is very thin ; when the box from amazon arrived i looked in the box and almost did n't find the book , that 's how thin it is . of course it is quality not quantity that matters , and there too this book falls short . it was not written by a psychologist , in fact the educational qulifications of the author are not revealed . he is a `` management consultant to churches . '' the average web page has more information than this book . definitely not worth the price
