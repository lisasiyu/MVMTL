i wanted to like this book so badly ... ... because i thought white oleandar was brilliant . but this book ? not so much . i would not be surprised if paint it black were something fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published . it felt much less fully realized . i found the text to be sprawling , unedited , self-indulgent . i generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators , but this one was more tiring than she was menacing . the whole book was written in one note , so i , too , agree with the `` flat '' description . i found the characters ( the distant , brilliant , rich mother ; the sassy best friend ; the beautiful , troubled boyfriend ) to be very stock and borderline cliche . i absolutely savored every word of fitch 's first book ; reading this one , unfortunately , was like returning to a restaurant where you 'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life , only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it .
