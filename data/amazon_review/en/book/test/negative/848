the elephant in the capitalist room let me see if i have got this right ? the only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way ? that way we all gain ? ok the bosses of nike , mcdonalds , and wal-mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk , but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide ? sounds good : who would want to be the party pooper ? ! well someone 's got to be , and for the simple reason that we do n't live on a planet the size of jupiter . the oil 's finite : we know that but ca n't be bothered to act on it . even the supply of water is turning out to be finite : the south east of england is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water . ok , they could ship it in from the rest of the uk where there 's no problem , but for reasons that do n't quite add up that 's not possible . it 's not the corporate solution , if you will forgive the pun . has it occurred to anyone , i wonder , if it 's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems ? yes , i know marx and stalin do n't offer any fixes , but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced : growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not .
