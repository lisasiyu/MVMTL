ultimately less satisfying than one would hope although in some ways provocative , this book poses a question it never adequately grapples with -- namely , can the `` materiality '' of race be properly characterized or understood as a `` discursive limit '' to ideological constructions of ethnicity without being understood as existing outside of discourse ? it seems to me that eng fails to address the question of whether such constructions may be regarded as either a pre- or extra-discursive `` hard kernel of the real , '' one the one hand , or simply another aspect of discourse , on the other hand . his work would benefit from a more thorough engagement with , and analysis of , the `` objet petit a '' in the work of zizek and lacan . perhaps `` race '' in general ought to be regarded a primordial psychic `` hole , '' an `` absence '' or pure negativity where a `` grounding '' for discourse ought to be but proves to be lacking . unfortunately that is a proposition that eng hints at but does not explore .
