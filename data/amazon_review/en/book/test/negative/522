just 1001 books some prof likes like so many bad , bad movies , this book is a beautiful production . it features slick , heavy paper ; a million color pictures ; attractive , readable typeface ; witty contributors . its proportions seem just right for its weight . but unless you just love grazing on hors d'oeuvres ( and many do ) , you 're likely to be disappointed by this beautiful but cynical exercise in marketing to the culturally insecure . as somebody has already noted : no iliad . no odyssey . no aeschylus . no euripides . no boccaccio . no chaucer . no dante . no machiavelli . no shakespeare . no marlowe . no old or new testament . no q'uran . no lao-tse , confucius , bhagavda-gita ( really short and really good ) . no beowulf . no sir gawain and the green knight . in fact , only 13 works from before 1700 make the cut - and lest you think fun is the criterion , one of them is john lyly 's euphues long regarded as one of the most unreadable and , shall we say , `` affected '' works in english literature . you get john lyly instead of john milton . on the other hand , you do get 69 titles of books that have appeared since 2000 . that 's a lot of `` classics '' in record time . how did they pick these ? and there 's another 700 - out of 1001 , if you can dig it , `` you must read before you die '' written in the 20th century . the 19th century is well represented , i 'll grant . huck finn is here - but not twain 's more complicated letters from the earth , the mysterious stranger , a connecticut yankee , or pudd'nhead wilson . they also felt it necessary to fill out the list with a few short stories like lovecraft 's `` the mountains of madness '' and gogol 's `` the nose . '' great stories , but two actual books had to go to make room for them . books like the red badge of courage , for example . or maybe the red badge got crowded out by justine or american psycho . this is a book for people who like to read about books in snappy reviews , and look at color pictures of books . you 'll find some titles worth pursuing , but you could do better , for starters , just by getting a list of cliff 's notes titles and going on from there . you can do that for free
