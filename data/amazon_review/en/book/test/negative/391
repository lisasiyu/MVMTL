a way to destroy the declaration of independence in this book , the author tries to encourage americans to forget the declaration of independence because even though a plurality of men have rights , the rights of individuals have never been identified . so , the author becomes a member of marilyn ferguson 's aquarian conspiracy and the new age movement , which place individuals above `the people ' of the usa and its union . on p. 277 , the author says that the truth or falsities of the natural rights philosophy of the declaration of independence is a meaningless question . while the author 's conclusions can be challenged , his book has been out-dated by advanced knowledge . first , his writing is out-dated by the 1920 discovery that ' all empirical data are symbolic . ' thus , one must ask , 'how can the meaning of the declaration of independence become a meaningless when the declaration is formed out of symbols that must be given meaning in order to interpret it correctly ? second , modern science has recently led to the scientific proof of god 's existence . how can man have no natural rights if god exists ? if the author 's succeeding generations are accepting this book , the usa is in deep trouble .
