too easy while containing a number of intersting plans for small homes , this book falls short on several accounds . first , there is almost no text save what is on the inside of the jacket . that 's right : no introduction , no methodology . there is no explanation of which competitions the plans were taken from or what awards they won . ( amusingly , i went to show my neighbor one of the plans that i liked . he said he liked it too but that it was an old plan from a competition in the early 90 's . and would you believe that he happened to have a copy of the competition from which the plan was taken ! ) secondly , as to the plans themselves , dimensions are rarely marked and often unclearly . in the case of two or three of the plans this makes them nearly unintelligable . the lack of wall sections or descriptions of materials used for the majority of the plans makes it impossible to understand the particulars of what makes the houses energy effecient . in short , the book far from lives up to its description and is n't worth spending the money for a handful of plans since a person can look at plans all day long for free online .
