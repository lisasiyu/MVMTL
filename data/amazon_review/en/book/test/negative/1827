too much speculation if you want to read about scientific facts this is not the book for you . the scientific underpinnings of this speculative book are briefly mentioned and not elaborated upon in much detail . it 's better to just read his paper on the somatic marker hypothesis ( which is disputed by the way ) . without a background in neuroscience it is difficult to evaluate his ideas in a serious way , and anyway he asks for introspection ( a la william james ) from the reader more than anything else
