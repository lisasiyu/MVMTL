do n't get me started ! because she is a real-life `` wife of , '' gigi levangie grazer has been hailed as the `` on the inside '' hollywood chick-litter . inexplicably , it turns out , because `` the starter wife '' is full of the vapid , name-dropping superficiality that any housewife from nebraska could dream up . gracie is a `` wife of '' -- wealthy , toned , dyed and perfectly preserved , and married to a hollywood heavyweight with one kid . until kenny hits midlife crisis -- he dresses loudly , gets an earring , and then tells gracie that he wants a divorce . in the dizzying whirlwind of divorce , gracie finds out that he 's having an affair with britney spears ( presumably in the months before she started slumming it with kevin whatsisface ) . a concerned pal lends gracie her malibu house , so the newly-divorced can get her bearings and life back on track . and as she wanders the california beaches with her gay pal and married neurotic friend , gracie finds herself desired by not just one but two men -- a handsome homeless man , and kenny 's dissatisfied has-it-all boss . can she become more than kenny 's `` starter wife '' ? okay , it has a different plot -- one that shar jackson might find emotional satisfaction in , admittedly . but the core of `` the starter wife '' is yet another thin plot , with a moronic heroine and lots of name-dropping . it 's even worse that much of grazer 's name-dropping is out of date -- since this book went to press , brad and jen have broken up . so no one 's worried about them procreating . grazer 's lack of inspiration shows through in the storyline itself , which meanders aimlessly between hollywood-expose cliches and middle-aged-woman-reinvents-self cliches . the writing meanders as well , as if the author is desperately trying to fill up space . grazer even has the excruciating taste to name gracie 's gay pal `` will . '' it 's not witty or cute , just embarrassing . perhaps the biggest flaw is that gracie -- the wronged wife of-turned-starter wife -- is a pill . despite the men going gaga over her , the supposedly smart gracie comes across as a bitter airhead , obsessed with age even when she 's feeling good about herself . kenny is a cliche of the selfish ex , while will is a cliche of the lovable gay pal . only lou , a tired mogul who wants to know what people really think of him , comes across as a real person . with more hollywood tale-telling and absurd cliches , gigi levangie grazer slumps even further in her sophomore effort . sure it 's just a fluff book , but it 's really bad fluff
