ugh ! i hated this book . this family has two girls , racie and jaynell . rachie is a girly-girl and jaynell is a tomboy . it seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa . her parents are just plain crazy . mama repedily whipped racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to `` tear up '' their hides each time they do something he does not like . once jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar , nearly strangleing her , and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize . then jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on racie . her parents are just crazy . then grandpa dies . dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it . i understand that sparking fear in a child 's eye is a good thing . children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy . racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs . jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful . these people were crazy . this book is crazy
