stumbling to the south pole as a lover of all things glacial ( with antarctica holding a particularly special place in my heart ) , i was thrilled to come across this book in my local library . the book promised to deliver an enjoyable blend of history , science and culture in an entertaining travelogue format . sadly , i soon found myself disappointed . by the time i was halfway through , i was struggling to make progress through what should have been an engaging read . wheeler suffers for the most part from a lack of direction . her `` travels '' consist of spur-of-the-moment helicopter rides to various locations on the ice that fail to be distinguishable after the fourth or fifth trip . indeed , at times the book reads more like segments of a blog interspersed haphazardly with snippets of polar exploration history or the odd fact about glacial ice or penguins . this is further muddled with somewhat contrived musings on american culture ( they 're all depicted like they 're ex-cowboys from texas ) , or anomalous personal asides that try to be meaningful but come across as undeveloped filler material . individual chapters have no particular structure or purpose , and so the finished product feels a bit like slogging along through the variations of the same thing : funny anecdote , helicopter ride , historical bit , description of another station 's toilet facilities or the food they eat , personal aside . after several chapters of this jumpy , disjointed writing style , following the narrative stops being fun and feels more like work . this is unfortunate ; wheeler 's writing is n't necessarily poor , but seems to suffer from a bad editing job and a lack of planning . the anecdotes are amusing , the history fascinating , but when it comes to the science and the researchers themselves wheeler largely fails to make a case for their relevance . instead , they come across as slightly eccentric guinea pigs with odd-but-quaint obsessions . still , perhaps the book 's greatest crime is that she largely fails to capture the beauty and utter wildness of this last frontier on earth , and in the end i felt no closer to antarctica than when i first picked up the book . ~ jacquelyn gil
