unfortunately the cure did not work for me i 've been an acne sufferer since i was 13 years old , and have been on every antibiotic , tried every topical medication in combination with those antibiotics , and have been on 3 courses of accutane in the last 8 years . my acne has never been extremely severe ... but it has been quite resistant to most treatments . i was really excited when i bought this book and read the reviews , it sounded like it might really be the cure i 'd been searching for all these years . the plan was a lot of work , especially at night with the ice packs , but i was willing to try anything . i followed the plan exactly as stated for 6 full weeks with little to no improvement . that was my experience .
