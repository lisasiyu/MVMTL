inadequate and biased despite attempts to keep an open mind , i grew increasingly annoyed at the omissions , exaggerations and half-truths passed off as researched facts in this book . the author calls cuba - a country under a dictator which holds no elections - a & quot ; democracy & quot ; and extols the virtues of the revolution without ever presenting the views and the injustices perpetrated against those who opposed the revolution . it is a shame that a work which could have been an objective scholarly book instead is little better than a propaganda pamphlet
