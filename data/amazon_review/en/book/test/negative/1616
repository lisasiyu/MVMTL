do n't buy this book ! this has to be one of the worst ever organic chemistry books ever devised . the author will give a detailed explanation with illustrations and at the very end of the discussion , once you have committed the information to memory , the book will say that it does not happen this way . the author seems to wax poetic , however , he gives no simple list of rules for common nomenclature problems , for example , i defy you to find a list of how to name alkanes under iupac rules . all you want is a simple list , for example , 1 ) find the longest chain of carbons , 2 ) ... ... ... instead of this you will be exposed to extraneous quotes from plays and movies as well as anecdotes from the authors life . another complaint is that the book gives several good questions in the text and at the end of the chapter , but no answers in the back . if you want the answers , you have to purchase the 40.00 solution manual . my condolences to you if your o-chem teacher has been hoodwinked into using this book by the publisher , the only advice i can give is that you purchase the solutions manual , because this gives some very detailed explanations . good luck , because you will need it
