blatant puppetry of the anti-bush movement the title of the book certainly was a great inducement to buy the book . thinking that it would be an informed commentary on key elements of bush 's character , i purchased this book and eagerly awaited its arrival . starting off well , the author lays out what he purports to be the architecture of a meaningful and detailed analysis . then , sadly it degenerates into a self serving diatribe filled with epithets and derogatory terms . whether or not you support the president , any credible review of his actions from a psychiatry perspective should at least appear unbiased . not the case here . mr. frank quickly descends into child like name calling and remarks that should never come from a professional . he cites theories from others that indicate it is impossible to accurately apply a diagnosis without lengthy study , then in the next few paragraphs violates that premise by applying the very diagnosis he earlier claimed was impossible . finally , ( and i have learned my lesson here ) the final words of the book are a call for bush 's impeachment . what that has to do with an unbiased psychological analysis i have no idea . i now will read the final paragraph from any book mr. frank writes to understand his motivation before sharng my hard earned money with him . unless you are a closed minded rabid bush hater , this book will not appeal to you . if you are of such ilk , just rewards are yours for the reading
