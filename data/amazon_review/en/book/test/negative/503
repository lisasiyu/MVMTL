snarky not funny bryson is a pretty good writer . his prose is flowing and very easy to read . this book is 300 pages and i read it in 3 days . my complaint is his lousy attitude toward people . he made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman . plus , this is a book about traveling across america . i do n't mind americans complaining about what 's wrong here . i do it myself occasionally . i do n't mind people in other countries criticizing the usa . i make judgments about other countries , some unflattering . but there is something grating about americans living in other countries coming back to travel the usa and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor . stay in england if it 's so bad here
