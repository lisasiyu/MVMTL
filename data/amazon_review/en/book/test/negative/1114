he 's been hiding in houston too long `` the best way i know to resuscitate the theatre is to produce dangerous new works , '' says stuart ostrow in his very slim ( 154 pages , double spaced with wide margins ) new memoir of his producing career . however he does not define `` dangerous new works . '' from reading the book , it seems his definition of `` dangerous new works '' is whatever is being touted by the village voice . ( richard foreman , homosexuality , multiculturalism , tom eyen , etc . ) stuart ostrow has a story , but he is looking at it from the wrong point of view . the way he sees it , he was producing quality innovative stuff that the world conspired to make fail . another way of looking at it would show a talented young producer who , after producing big hits with 1776 and pippin , went pretentious and politically correct with his subsequent shows and understandably failed . his damnation of mel brooks is unjustified since ostrow himself says that he has not seen the producers . well , stu , i have news for you . the producers was a dangerous new work . it was a slap in the face at political correctness and pretentiousness . it single-handedly killed the bloated euro musical that had dominated broadway for twenty years and paved the way for outrageous , unpretentious shows like hairspray and the wedding singer . the producers resuscitated the american musical and ostrow missed it . ostrow also badmouths wicked claiming it was dependent upon special effects and spectacle . if that were true , dance of the vampires would still be running . the spectacle of wicked enhances its compelling story , unlike the all the additional sets and extra players gratuitously inserted into the boring la bete . ostrow seems to think that problems can be solved by creating yet another bureaucracy to choose the artists who shall be anointed . evidence has show that the bureaucratic method produces pretentious work like that of michael john lachiusa and jason robert brown , which the public doggedly refuses to embrace . ostrow tells some good anecdotes , but i wish there had been more of them . there 's the germ of a fascinating book in this volume and in ostrow 's previous memoir ( also extremely brief and shares some material with this volume ) . but at this point , there 's still not a real book between the two of them
