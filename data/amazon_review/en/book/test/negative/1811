weak summary of the e-myth revisited . this book is a watered down version of the e-myth revisited , which is a good book . the e-myth contactor - is a summary of m. gerber 's program with `` contractor stories . '' there is no true insight into the contactor industry . my guess is this is the 1st of many books focusing on specific industries . my advice is to skip this book , just purchase gerber 's e-myth revisited & make the connections yourself
