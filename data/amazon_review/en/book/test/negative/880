ca n't believe it won the quill award i loved the secret life of bees but i found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting . its difficult to like any of the characters , especially the main character , and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous . it has as much deapth as a harlequin romance novel . the relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly . all in all , a poor follow-up to sue monk kidd 's break out bestseller . do n't waste your time .
