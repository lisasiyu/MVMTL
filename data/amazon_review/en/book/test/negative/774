is this book for real ? this is the first ds book that i have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did i try again ? ? ? ? ? ? ? can i really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real ? i wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin ? i would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance . coop only dates 20 something 's . he has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child . this does n't bother his new girlfriend , an ( early 30 's ) resident pediatrician , who works in icu with preemies at all , who tells him to `` have her get an abortion '' . a bit too blasï¿½ for me . coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy . i had a hard time getting into this premise . the way ds totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable . everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters . every character is , of course , extremely wealthy ( even though several are hiding it ) . most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are . i realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for ds .
