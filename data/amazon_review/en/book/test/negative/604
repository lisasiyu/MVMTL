not quite what it seems nansook hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to hyojin moon , but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents ' machinations to get her married into the moon family . eyewitnesses tell of nansook visiting the moon household and knowing full well of hyojin 's excesses in advance of her marriage . the hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the moon family , and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first moon daughter , they pushed nansook to marry a moon son . though i do n't know all the motives , the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that ms. hong has not been honest about . it is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of rev moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect , given her own deceit
