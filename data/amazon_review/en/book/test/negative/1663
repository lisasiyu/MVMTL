enough martha grimes has had a good thing going with the richard jury series , until now . bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book . more like muddled , drawn out , and difficult . the story within a story is an intriguing idea , but it went nowhere . the plot is weak , the characters ' actions unbelievable , and the ending disappointing . i have enjoyed reading this series , but to be honest , this book was a waste of time . i think it 's time for jury , plant , and pals to be put to rest .
