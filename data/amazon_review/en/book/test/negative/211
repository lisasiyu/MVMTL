survivor in death the beginning of this book was excellent , but dont be fooled , the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book . the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers . what 's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were . this was one of the worst books i have ever read , i 'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery . dont waste your time reading it
