a guide to the project mgmt body of knowledge-3rd ed the book is good in context but i when i got to the center of the book , it split in half . now the first half of the book falls out of the binder . i 'm going to have to remove all the pages , punch holes and put them in a binder . this is a guide that i will use and reuse frequently . i 'm disappointed that it did not hold up better . i have n't even finished the class yet and i did n't abuse the book , just opened it to read and highlight certain sections . would you consider replacing the book
