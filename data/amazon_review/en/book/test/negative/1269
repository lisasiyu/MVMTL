another pretty book there 's no doubt that this is a gorgeous book . unfortunately , i think it 's better for your coffee table than your kitchen . while there are beautiful pictures ( lots of nigella ) and several great recipes , the book did n't seem very useful to me . i bought and loved `` how to be a domestic goddess '' , so , i got this book from the library to check it out , thinking it would be somewhat the same . i have to say i was dissapointed . i only found 4 usable recipes in the whole book . ( granted , i am not a gourmet chef by any means , but i do consider myself to be a lover of great food and a good cook . ) while there are some nice recipes and lots of great photos this book is a more of a `` pretty to look at '' picture book than a hard core recipe resource .
