an opportunity blown such a wonderful book has been brought down several notches by employing a reader that puts one to sleep . my travels are made signifacantly more enjoyable by listening to books-on-cd while driving . i 've tried several times to listen to the civil war but had to give it up . mr. whitener 's voice is so drone and expressionless that i quickly loose interest . sorry to be so negative , but this cd is very disappointing . stick to the book
