the ak of poker books it looks pretty , and has shiny pictures , but if you want to learn something new about no limit holdem , this is not the book for you . this book is filled with barry 's opinion on appropriate ettiquette at a game , money management ( nothing specific , just him saying do n't blow it - seriously ) and is basically his autobiography . i play online professionally for a living ( small stakes ) but am developing into a pro . i would recommend the theory of poker - david sklansky . tournament poker for advanced players - david sklansky . and of course super system - 1 or 2 is the same for the nl holdem section . i mean no book is going to turn you into a pro , it takes a combination of things , and alot alot of play . this book will not make you a better poker player , simple as that
