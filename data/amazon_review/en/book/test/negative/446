nice pictures but no real projects the book has nice full colour pictures of games , and touches the surface of moddeling in 3ds max , but does't work out real examples of modeling . examples of cubes and primitives are all that are supplied , no professional quality buildings or scenes as the cover suggests . not money well spend . recomended book from quake arena modeler paul steed is modeling a character in 3ds ma
