agree with `` lost in translation '' i have loved each and every one of jane hamilton 's other novels and highly recommend them : the book of ruth , a map of the world , short history of a prince and disobedience . this book , sadly , does not rank among them . it feels forced and uninteresting , with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios . i 've already paid for it , so i 'll probably try to finish it , but do n't waste your time or money . read another hamilton instead
