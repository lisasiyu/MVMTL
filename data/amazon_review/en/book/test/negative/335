misses the point after using dr.dyer 's aaah meditation cd for a month , i decided that i wanted to learn more this meditation . therefore , i bought the book manifest your destiny . the book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism . there are many things that disturb me about this book . dr. dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book , chapter , or verse . one of the bible quotes he uses is `` is it not written in your law `i have said , you are gods ? ' '' ( john 10:34 ) this is the passage to which jesus referred when he said this to the pharisees who were attempting to charge him with blasphemy : `` god standeth in the congregation of god ; he judgeth among the gods . how long will ye judge unjustly , and respect the persons of the wicked ? ... i said , ye are gods , and all of you sons of the most high . '' ( psalms 82:1,2,6 ) . the unjust judges of israel ( i.e. , the pharisees ) were the subject of these verses . they were civil magistrates because of their authority and power ; and , they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of israel . dr. dyer uses this verse completely out of context . scripture can not be broken . jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are god 's other laws . a true seeker of spiritualism can not reconfigure god 's word for his own purpose . neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about god 's word and actually expect to know god 's and come into a relationship with him . dr. dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism . the fact of the matter is that according to jesus the door to god 's kingdom is narrow ( luke 13:24 ) . there are no shortcuts . lastly , a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions . this appears to be a main theme of dr. dyer 's book . those who seek god first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a `` gift '' from him . we do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust god and put him first in our lives . dr. dyer seems to miss the point .
