voo doo doctor sad to say this book is an embarrassment to both psychiatry and the christian faith . however , neither should be blamed for the nonsense of a man who claims to represent both . there is so much wrong with this book that it is n't worth getting into . i find it highly ironic , though , that peck is guilty of the same grievous sin and `` malpractice '' as the father of his character jersey . jersey 's father was a psychologist ( not an m.d . ) , but use to put on a physician 's coat when seeing patients . peck saw this as highly offensive and evil . yet he , a psychiatrist , had no qualms about pretending to be an exorcist and perhaps causing severe psychological , not to mention spiritual damage to his `` patients . '' if this book has any merit it lies in its ability to be a good case study on how not to practice psychiatry . from reading his books i ca n't help but get the feeling that while peck sincerely wanted to help people he was too caught up in himself . perhaps the enormous early success he enjoyed from `` people of the lie '' did a trip on his mind . i hope he and all those he treated can find healing . dominus custodit te ab omni malo : custodiat animam tuam dominus .
