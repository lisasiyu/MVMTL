cheap rip-off of elmore leonard dave barry 's novel is a quick read , but there 's nothing fresh about the story or the characters . the story centers on many different characters that become involved in a potential airport disaster -- a columnist , his son , a rich , sleazy lawyer , a wannabe criminal , etc . like elmore leonard 's books , the characters begin to collide in unpredictable ways . but the pay-off is just not that great . you may find yourself thinking `` what 's the point ? '' after finishing the novel . this book was made into a pretty forgettable movie that featured a great cast ( tim allen , rene russo , stanley tucci , tom sizemore , etc . )
