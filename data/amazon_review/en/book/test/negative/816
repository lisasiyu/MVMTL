straight from two of the manufacturers this is by far the most useless book on the subject of the state of education . for instance , while the authors make much of the relative stability of sat scores , they ignore the decline in scores from the naep , ctbs , and mat scores ( to name a few ) from the same period . they also keep silent about the fact that calculators were once forbidden from the math portion of the sat , playing a role no doubt in said stability . dr. lawrence stedman , an associate professor of education at the state university of new york at binghamton , ph.d. in educational policy studies , and self-decribed progressive & quot ; sympathetic to their concerns , & quot ; wrote an article in the peer-reviewed education policy analysis archives . he pointed out numerous examples of the fudging -- whether out of duplicity or incompetence , you judge -- of & quot ; facts & quot ; to support the authors ' farcical claims , and where such claims went unsupported . in other words , while criticism usually comes from & quot ; the enemy , & quot ; one of their own blasted this book for its inaccuracies . since it could not possibly have been written with a straight face , i recommend spending your money on something written with more integrity . there is a real crisis in education , there are manufacturers , and this book rolled straight off their assembly line
