wow ! i fell asleep reading that was the worst novel ever . i did n't follow the story line at all . it seemed so random , almost like there was n't a story line at all . i was soooo confused with the book because i did n't see any characters except some hydrogen , cobalt , and zinc oxide . there were so many marraiges between hydrogen and carbons and other oddly named people . i was revolted when reading that 2 hydrogens married an oxygen . do not get this book . it is possibly the worst story i have had the misfortune to read
