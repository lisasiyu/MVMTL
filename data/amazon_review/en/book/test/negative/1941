augh ... i really did n't like this . the idea for the seer was interesting enough , i suppose , but it was n't executed well . and vesputo ... first of all , who the heck names a character vesputo ? it screams cliche . anyways , he was just sort of ... semi-evil . like he was trying too hard to be manical and ended up looking like a video-game obsessed member of generation x with the goatee and the shirt that says `` i am the villan '' or some other rot like that . it just did n't work . and the whole ... 'random assasination of the king ' thing was n't done that well . i had to read it twice , because i was like `` eh ? what the *heck* just happened here ? '' . and the romance was something that you 'd expect a third grader to write ... the handsome prince suddenly shows up after a few hundred pages and it 's all `` my love ! '' and they have n't seen each other for what , a decade or so ? it 's kind of ridiculous . so all in all , it 's something like three and a half stars for concept , minus two for execution . but amazon does n't let me do half stars
