do n't ! possibly the worst book i have ever read . the `` style '' could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader . the plot is an imbecilic rehash of the divinci code . do n't bother keeping track of any details , because everything turns out to be irrelevant . if you want to entertain yourself and your friends , however , check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk . now open the book at random and read aloud . this should cause hysterical i-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter .
