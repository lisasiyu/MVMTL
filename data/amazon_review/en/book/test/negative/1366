hmm i 'd say robertson is the new world order the arrogant way in which many evangelicals behave has me believing they themselves are the new world order.here 's my point , if a religion wants to make all other religions obsolete , have controll of the economy and middle east , advance their cause in a materialistic manner and rule the earth , this is truly the new world order.the obvious hatred of anything but western religion and philosophy could have a frightening outcome.one of my dearest friends lives in colorado springs.her family goes way back and they are very resentful of the many new comers whom have made their town a haven for born agains . you ca n't walk down the street without the feeling that some evangelical will walk up to you and start preaching.this is just a start for them i 'd assume.their goal stretches over the earth , to conquer and controll.politics and religion are tied into one another and this is very common with born agains.in a sense he is writing about himself and his chrones.ca n't help but think they need to look in the mirror to see who the real anti christ is.jesus never condoned this arrogance
