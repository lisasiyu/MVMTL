think return on investment i bought a copy of this book and it is forcing me to give greater attention to an arguably important part of handicapping , therefore , it might be worth the money . while klein 's percentage of winners and return-on-investment calculations are adequate for the leaders at the first call , they are without merit for those that do not lead because he dumps both categories in together . this statistical error causes a disparity , but it only `` seems '' that the roi between leaders and non-leaders looks larger . but , sheesh , there is only one leader but several non-leaders . using basic math , if the win percentage for leaders in a certain category is 30 % then the win percentage for non-leaders is 70 % . using steve 's calculation method , in an 8-horse race you would bet $ 2 on the leader and $ 14 ( the `` non-leaders '' times 2 ) on the non-leaders . even if a non-leader won there would still be six losers among the non-leaders so the `` win percentage '' is just 14 percent . unless the winner pays off at more than 6-1 odds it 's a negative return-on-investment ! in my opinion , look to other handicapping books for a better return on investment
