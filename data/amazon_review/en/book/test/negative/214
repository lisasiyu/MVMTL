this book is too fat rev . dyson dissects the great black man of the last century and attempts to get some insight into how his image translates to modern america . i found the chapter concerning dr. king 's embrace of democratic socialism to be enlightening , but i found the rev . dyson handing out alibis for king 's adultery disappointing . equally mind blowing is dyson 's using overblown language to assail the king family 's efforts to control their loved one 's image . i wonder why there are hard feelings , since dexter and coretta king talked to him for this book . this is an interesting character study that does draw some modern parallels , but would have been better if it were about 3 chapters shorter
