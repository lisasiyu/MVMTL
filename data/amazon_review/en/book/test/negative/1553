didactic and morally condescending my biggest complaint is willis 's assumptions about the reader . she assumes every reader is deeply and fundamentally flawed , with money only exacerbating existing conditions . people that are relatively level-headed and well-adjusted will find little in this book about the trouble money can bring . they will , however , find out how money affects those that already have psychological issues . the book should not be used as a predictor of the problems that come with money . moreover , she also assumes that the reader is well-versed in christian values and are open to christian citations , further narrowing readability . in chapters where a case-file would be helpful , willis instead harkens to biblical texts and the parables of jesus to validate her insights . for interest 's sake , willis also highlights mostly stories of the extreme , case-files that seem to relate to only few people . occasionally , an example will be aptly targeted toward most of the audience , but most of the time , the cases apply to people that have inherited many millions or posses standing , major psychological issues . furthermore , the lessons that the author distills from her case files are rather ambiguous and broad . it is a somewhat veiled example of `` fortune cookie '' therapy . in the key moments where willis could show the reader how to learn from the extreme cases , the author resorts to a very unspecific retelling of the case-file , with little insight about how to improve . the book might have been substantially stronger given more real-life examples with deft analyses . in addition , the book has an overall patronizing nature that needs to be addressed . the author , someone that has seen so many problems afflicting inheritors , has the chance to truly help without adding too many personal feelings but instead insists on injecting an air of moral superiority . i picked up the book as a complete novice in the world of inheritance and its ramifications . unfortunately , i remain as such , due to the handbook 's narrow aim and arrogant nature
