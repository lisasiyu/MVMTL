good for a laugh the book begins with huffington complaining that her cable bill has just gone up while the ceo of her cable company just got a fat raise . poor huffington , the victim of ruthless greedy ceo 's . here 's an idea arianna , dump cable and sign up with dish network or voom or directtv , or just cancel service altogether , its just cable tv not oxygen . she really does n't discuss the fact that there are such alternatives . why are there so many alternatives to those meanies at the cable company ? because of deregulation which she bemoans as the source of all the worlds troubles in the first place . this sort of nutty reasoning is used throughout the entire book . if youre an angry lefty by all means buy this book . if you want to learn somthing , do n't waste your money
