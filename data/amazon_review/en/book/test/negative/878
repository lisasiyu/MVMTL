i disliked anna i can actually understand morvan 's character better given the 14th century backdrop of this novel . however , anna sounded more like a 21st century feminist to me . she did not sound very genuine for a woman in that period . i wish madeline had never written this book , given that this is the only one of her 11 novels ( if i remember the number correctly ) that i had to put down before reaching the end . i just could not take the characters , mainly anna . however , i loved to see david drop by : ) .. rags
