ignores the obvious cultural contributions of the scotch-irish jeff bigger 's book is well written ; however it offers little to our understanding of the unique ethnic contributions of the german and scotch-irish settlers who dominated the cultural landscape of appalachia . this is seen in his treatment of twentieth century women . loretta lynn ( a native of eastern kentucky ) is briefly discussed on only one page while four pages were written about billie holiday ( born in eastern pennsylvania and raised in baltimore ) and janis joplin . dolly parton ( an east tennessee , native ) earned only one page of text and rosa parks ( born in tuskegee alabama ) received five pages . janis joplin was born and raised in port arthur , texas . it seems biggers is confused about the geographic boundaries of appalachia . he , like many non-appalachian natives who regard themselves as enlightened scholars of culture , want to see appalachia as anything but white and nearly homogeneous with regard to ethnicity . rediscovering the south 's celtic heritage does a much better job of showing the region 's culture as it developed over time
