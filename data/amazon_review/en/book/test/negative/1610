superficial analysis this book is good if you want to be warned over and over to wash your hands ! if you are looking for the difference between viruses and bacteria , actual scientific references or interesting facts about how germs and bacteria live , reproduce and colonize us - look elsewhere . this book was too preachy and did n't have enough information for anyone with a genuine interest in biology , human physiology , or health .
