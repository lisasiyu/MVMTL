american readers/students look elsewhere this text will be a chore to read for most american students who are new to gis . although the author ( s ) manage to cram alot of information into the relatively short chapters , the sentences are long and difficult to understand because of the overly wordy , jargon-filled 'proper ' use of british english & amp ; spellings . if you decide to purchase this book , then i highly recommend the 'oxford unabridged english dictionary ' to go along with it . the majority of the students in my class & quot ; geographic information systems i & quot ; at southwest texas state university , which has one of the best geography programs in the nation , felt the same way i do , and also thought that the book was too advanced for an introductory gis class . i think that the professors at southwest texas state university are now using a different text for that class . also , people always complain that books tend to be geared toward a single software program- well , like it or not , in the united states , esri has a monopoly on geographic software so you are going to have to learn arcview/info one way or another
