le carre 's laurels do n't rescue this book a wasted effort from one on the most perceptive minds alive . he dropped his past standards on this book . only the gems of wisdom about human nature gives it value . an unknown author would have had this book rejected , or at least criticized . i agree with the following observations taken from other reviewers : `` the story was all over the place and the ending far from satisfying . '' `` the first hundred or so pages move at a glacial pace , and the author 's disjointed manner of storytelling soon becomes confusing and annoying . '' `` far too much of the book took place in flashback ... vacillating from vague self-pity to vague longing to vague regret and back ... of the three pivotal characters , two are presented almost entirely in flashback . '' `` too dense and slow moving ... even though the language is always wondrous . '' `` ... novel seems dark and pointless . '' `` numbing dive into the depths of one man 's self-absorption left me gasping for air . '' if you are new to le carre , read his earlier works first or you may never read them after this work
