was she really that good of a mother ? i do n't feel that miller made much of an attempt to prove that anna was in fact a `` good '' mother . like another reviewer said , i do n't think she was a bad mother , but the book really did n't go into much detail about anna 's relationship with molly ( especially up until anna ' ex-husband filed for custody ) and instead focused on anna 's life experiences and psyche . after brian said he would n't send molly back , anna did n't even seem that concerned about molly 's mental and emotional well-being . she just focused on her notion that leo 's actions were simply taken out of context , and while she wanted to see molly again , i got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her `` rights '' as a mother , not out of a concern for her daughter . and what was so great about leo anyway ? ? he was n't exactly nice to anna , often condescending to her , and from the beginning i felt that his affection for molly was a farse , simply to stay on anna 's good side . he also seemed sexually possessive of anna -- like the scene when he kept having sex with her after molly came into the bed because of a nightmare . i think anna loved her daughter , but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love , since she had never felt such an attraction before . as a result , her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for 2 months , with dire consequences . although she did show some signs of remorse , she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter 's welfare . if she had put her daughter first from the beginning , instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new `` family '' she and leo were forming , then she probably never would have lost custody of her child .
