interesting plot but bad details this book could have been so much better since the plot is really good . the writing here is a knockoff of michael crighton and really doesnt juve very well . i found myself skimming the pages after a while . the subject of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again
