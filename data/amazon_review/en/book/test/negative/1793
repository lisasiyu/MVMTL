149 vs 92 there are 149 5 star reviews and 92 one star reviews . this is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews . but what is more notable than that is the fact that the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them . lone nut theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false . posner totally disregards the parkland hospital doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head . he would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot . that somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts . to expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting .
