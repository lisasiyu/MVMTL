anti-muslim seems to be ok having enjoyed kellerman 's delaware stories , i happened on this one and was stunned by his cultural/racial bias . it is astounding how often the arabs , turks , bedouins , muslims are described as `` sweat stained , '' `` filthy , '' `` lazy '' and `` shiftless . '' the idiot arab boy and the dishonest shop keepers are typical . the israelis are always industrious , clean , eager to do the job . the `` good '' arab detective , mahoud , is n't even muslim -- he 's christian ! the description of the 1947 and 1967 wars are difficult to consume , knowing the complexity of the issues then . this was an old ( 1988 ) book , and one hopes that kellerman will stick to his detective/psychologist stories
