amateurish although the author clearly loves his subject , he is not a good writer . there are awkwardly worded sentences , misspellings , wrong names and dates , and clichï¿½ after cliche . this is basically a rehash of the george eells ' chapter that came out decades ago and offers little new information . the photographs are crudely reproduced and look like seventh generation photocopies . yes , the book is inexpensive , but it looks , feels , and reads like it . this must be a self-published book . the writer clearly needed an editor and a better printer . there 's a better book out there
