until you i have never enjoyed reading the novels of one historical romance author so much . but this was a dissapointment ms. small ! altough she always has bored me a trifle with her details , the plots are usually well thought out and intriguing . but in this novel , after finding the love of her life , patrick has dementia and they cancel their wedding plans . after two years she lets logan who pursues her constantly throughout the novel take her body and her hand in matrimony after she refuses him so long ! when it says : `` rosamund sat up . what was she doing ? she jumped from her bed , lokking to gather up her other garments . `` you shall not have me you monster ! '' i thought she was coming to her senses and would finally wait on her true love to regain his memory , but alas twas not to be . she should not have married again . it was tantamount to a betrayal ! i am so mad atms . small for ending this book this way ! i give the book two stars for the romance of a lifetime she allowed us to see between rosamund and patrick
