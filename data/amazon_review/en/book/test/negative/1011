bad book for lots of money there is little to respect about this book . if you are looking for factual , organized and informed writing , look elsewhere . i found the conjecture regarding tesla being an atlantean engineer , incarnate ; and the co-founder ( with marconi ) of a city of the future in south america -- well i 'm sorry , but who needs this . on the other hand , the photos of ufos were as good as any i have seen . on the plus side , the copied material ( tesla letters , patents and court transcripts ) was interesting
