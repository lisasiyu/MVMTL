why a classic ? i figured if oprah wanted america to read this book that it could n't be too bad . i had held out on reading faulkner , and now i know why . i read alot and love reading but this book , and `` as i lay dying '' makes me question why oh why faulkner is a classic . my hypothesis is that its so unapproachable therefore people think it must be brilliant . this is a good book for english class when you can sit around and discuss the meanings of it all and read sparknotes together . this is not a book for sitting at home and reading for yourself . if you want to know the story just go read the sparknotes version . the book itself is too hard to figure out and there is little plot . its just a long headache really .
