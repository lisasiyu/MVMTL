three points about this book after reading this book , i would like to make three points about it : 1 . ) first of all , do n't make this your first dean koontz book . this is the second book of the so-called christopher snow trilogy . read the first book in the trilogy first -- fear nothing . the first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book . 2 . ) second , please be aware that koontz has yet to write the third book in the christopher snow trilogy . this is a real shame , because seize the night ends on a cliffhanger of sorts . koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday , under the title ride the storm . but since it 's been over eight years since koontz has written a snow novel , i would n't expect this book anytime soon . 3 . ) third , i must admit i did n't really care for this book at all , and i say that as a koontz fan . lots of padding -- the action does n't really start until page 250 . koontz wastes a lot of space repeating things he originally wrote in fear nothing . i found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts . the plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel , killer monkeys , alternate realities , serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that 's just the tip of the iceberg ! even the characters in the book do n't seem to take any of it seriously . all the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic . i was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book . it was just too silly for my tastes . koontz is a great writer , but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable , fast-paced plot . instead of this book , i would therefore recommend watchers , intensity , odd thomas or velocity .
