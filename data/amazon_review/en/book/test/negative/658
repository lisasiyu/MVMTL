if i could choose 0 stars , i would . i recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because i need something to occupy my mind while i scan microfiche at work ( boooorrring ) . i actually have n't finished this book yet , but up until what i listened to tonight , i had n't made my mind up yet on how i felt about it . i was going to see it though , but now i 'm not sure if i will . i do n't even know where to start about what i do n't like about this book . before starting this book , ms. picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings , especially proceedings following such a great span of time . i 'll be the first to admit that i do n't know much about law , but it seems quite unrealistic that delia 's father andrew hopkins ( or should i say charles matthews ? ) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week . i find it hard to believe that on his first day , he would get beaten and practically raped ( i ca n't remember if he was or not ) . i could be wrong , but if 28 years have passed , would n't the statute of limitations passed , and even if they had n't , would n't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen ? and would n't it mean something that they were in a different state ? now , even though everyone else seemed to love her , delia was incredibly annoying ( and the actress who read her `` monologues '' in the audio version was equally annoying ) . women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her . i have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men , but rarely ever do . it just seems like a fantasy of picoults , and a very boring one at that . ah , a love triangle , gee , like that 's never been done before . one instance that sticks out is when delia gets upset that eric ( her fiancee and her fathers attorney ) does n't tell her about a court appearing , however , eric did n't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen . but , even the premise for that is questionable : would that really happen ? i mean seriously ! i also hated how the book shifted `` voices '' -- this is not a play , i do n't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective . i did n't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters . i half expected a chapter to be from sophie ( delia 's four year old daughter ) perspective . i could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore . i also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense , and then later incorporated into the passage , also not making sense . for example , eric narrates this dream he had about sondra , who is some beautiful girl he imagined . she turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush . later , ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up . somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit , when really they have no cohesive connection . also , between the three childhood friends ( delia , eric and fitz ) they talk about their memories constantly , as if that is the only thing that binds them together . real friendships do n't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past ... but it does in this book , because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends . to me , it just seems pretentious . what 's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all . one passage i remember is when delia is talking to fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born , and maybe they remember things that never happened to them . i might have that a little wrong , because it 's a bit confusing . it 's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense . it does n't even feel like it 's remotely trying to make sense at all ! the book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual , like picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical . all of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases . delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was four years old . for goodness sakes woman , i have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when i was four years old or younger , and most of them do n't make sense except for the fact that i know what my parents have told me . by the way she acts , you 'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped . also , she seems to recover memories all the time ... man , i wish i could do that . it just seems a bit implausible , that 's all . the book is saturated in gooey , sappy imagery , metaphors , anecdotes , memories , subplots , and so on . i am not so quick to totally bash an author , but it 's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that i loathe . if i wanted some sappy , melodramatic dimestore paperback i would have read one of those instead . i expected better from the synopsis on the back cover . overall , and i say overall without even finishing the book ( i have n't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet , but it sounds pretty ridiculous ) , that this is definitely one of the most horrible books i 've ever read , bar none . do yourself a favor and skip this one ... and definitely do n't pick up the audiobook . the voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to
