what good there is undermined by bigotry though mr. steyn does have strong opinions and some good observations , his judgements are tainted by an anti-gay bias ( he titles one chapter `` the fags '' , and it 's not meant affectionately ) . his readings of stories such as the reaction of lorenz hart upon hearing `` oklahoma '' in a blackout could have been better informed by further research , and he repeats lerner 's silly comment about lorenz hart being to short to be heterosexual so he had to turn to men . the book is also dated in many respects including the waning influence of british operettas and the public 's acceptance of stephen sondheim . rather than this book i would reccommend anything by ethan mordden or martin gottfried
