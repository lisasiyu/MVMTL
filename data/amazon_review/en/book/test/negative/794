disappointing mystery thriller sometimes i 've enjoyed books by david baldacci ( wish you well and the winner come to mind ) ; others , such as the last man standing did little for me . . . add split second , which i just heard , to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced secret service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . i cared little about any of the characters , and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also did n't do much for me , as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly , i did not particularly `` buy '' the man behind the crimes ; he just was n't all that believable .
