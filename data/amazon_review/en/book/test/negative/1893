unimaginative patterns ; assumes reader knows nothing about knitting this is one of the most disappointing knitting books i 've ever purchased . i expected patterns that would highlight the beauty of ribbon yarns but all i got were a bunch of basic patterns for purses , halter tops , square cushions , etc . author assumes that her reader does not know how to knit ; at least a quarter of the pages in the book are how-tos that apply to any kind of yarn
