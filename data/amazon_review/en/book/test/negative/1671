nothing new i bought this book thinking that it might be more than the usual time line history that so many other writers have produced . i was bitterly disappointed . nothing new to add to the history of the band and really quite a bland read . as someone who knows that there was more to the 'lads ' than what has been previously written , i was expecting more insight into their lives , more accurate information , and basically just more . the title of the book is quite misleading , as the only babylon that seemed to go on was tam 's alledged chasing of pat around hotel rooms and one recalled incident of les and a mate hiding 2 groupies on a freezing balcony . if you know anything about the rollers , you do n't need to buy this book in hopes of learning more . it simply is n't there . a huge disappointment for this long time roller fan .
