the self indulgent virus , a hindrance to the debate since the end of the cold war and the virtual eradication of the two other great political ideologies of the twentieth century , namely communism and fascism , the victory of capitalism has earned it the right to proceed unmolested and , to a very great degree , unquestioned in its dissemination to every point on the globe . this , as samir amin author of the liberal virus aptly points out , could be dangerous . capitalism is a system that has always been based on the darwinian principal of survival of the fittest and as such `` can produce nothing other than an intensification of the inequalities between people . '' true . so true . and anybody who takes the time to actually study adam smith 's , the wealth of nations , will see that the twin engines supposed to drive a capitalist economy are greed and competition , with very little regard for the actual well being of humans . this should come as no surprise , as a quick look around at the current champions of capitalist enterprise in america like insurance , energy and telecommunications will readily reveal . any thinking person must agree that it is at least worthwhile to keep a cautious eye on the current trajectory of unfettered capitalism , and inquiring into its possible dangers is undoubtedly healthy . in fact , what 's needed is a measured evaluation of capitalism as it exists today , both good and bad , with the kind of unflinching exploration into its darker implications provided by samir amin here . but in the current american political climate where knee-jerk conservatism hold sways and the petty ranting of narrow-minded demagogues is counted as reasoned political discourse , this is no time to inject an analysis of capitalism with anti-americanism and hand-wringing over the demise of socialism . a book like this advances the issue with only the most restrained and open-minded readers and , for the rest , drags the debate back into the muck of cold war hysterics . not only does amin reveal himself as a whiney , vindictive socialist who would love nothing more than to see america brought to its knees , but he is an obtuse and turgid writer of the kind only academia can produce . there were sentences in this book i had to read three times before i could figure out what he was saying , and his annoying habit of loading his sentences with digressive clauses , parenthetical clarifications and coined words , had me grateful that this book was only 112 pages long - i have read 300 page books that took me less time to get a handle on . all in all , the liberal virus explores some issues much in need of inquiry but does so in a way that is so off-putting that it can not gain much traction among american readers , no matter what their stripe , and can only serve to hinder the debate . what we need is a book about capitalism that can open minds , not scare them closed or befuddle them with the liberal self-indulgence of its author .
