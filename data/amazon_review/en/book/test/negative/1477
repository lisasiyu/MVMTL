not good enough this selfpaced training is one of the worst microsoft has produced so far . the only one that i can think of that is worse is the selfpaced training kit for ieak 4 . if you have bought it and are preparing for the mcp test . i advice you to read the chapters in the windows 2000 srv rk on the subjects for the test . also be sure to download some whitepapers from microsoft . the book alone just do n't prepare you good enough for the test
