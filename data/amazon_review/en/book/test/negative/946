wake me up when it 's over i loved the inferno , so i approached this book with the enthusiasm of a gourmand at an all-you-can-eat buffet . sadly , the bread turned out to be stale , the steak overdone and the desserts moldy . okay . now that i 've run that metaphor into the ground , let 's talk about vita nuova . i found it to be pretty darn tedious and highly melodramatic . the prose is self-indulgent and dry ; the poetry , while slightly better , falls into the same camp . you just want to say to the guy -- get a life ! at several points during the book , dante 's fellow townspeople mock him because of his constant waterworks and woe-is-me-ing . i sympathized with them , found myself laughing at this whiny , timid little man . dante , as he portrays himself in this book , is a bore , a sniveling , spoiled child .
