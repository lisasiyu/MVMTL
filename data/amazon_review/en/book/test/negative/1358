a waste of time dull and inane come to mind . consists mostly of peabody 's artificially `` catty '' - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets ( even the cat ) , fuzzy descriptions of egyptian `` archaeology '' ( ... ) . the plot is slow moving , clich√© and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts . i found more of pennance than pleasure in this read . avoid it
