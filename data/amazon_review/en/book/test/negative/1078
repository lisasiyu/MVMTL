the fantastic review of the journal this was a medieval project in my 7th grade humanities class the summary : catherine called birdy was a conflict type book . it was mostly about her pig head of a father trying to sell her to the richest man . if you like the way it sounds now you should look for a copy . it is quite interesting and has a lot of conflict in the book . a phew funny things were when catherine caught some objects on fire ! rating : i rated my book 2 stars because it was kind of boring . why is because all the book was really about was catherine 's father trying to sell off to the richest man . when i did like it was when she tried to get out of each man . who this book would be suited for : i would recommend this book to someone who really likes conflict books in the medieval times . also is if you are interested in action books .
