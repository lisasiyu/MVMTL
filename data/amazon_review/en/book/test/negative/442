means well , but short , repetitive , and unsubstantial daniel b. clendenin 's eastern orthodoxy christian : a western perspective seeks to introduce the history and theology of this little-known branch of christianity to protestants . an evangelical protestant , clendenin became acquainted with eastern orthodoxy while teaching at moscow state university . he is convinced that protestants and orthodox have much to learn from each other , and that protestants should approach the east with a `` hermeneutic of love '' . the work is divided into seven sections . the first is a general introduction and the second a brief history . the next four sections each deal with an aspect of orthodox theology unfamiliar or confusing to protestants . these are the emphasis on apophatic revelation , the use of icons , the relationship of scripture and tradition , and theosis . in the final section clendenin critiques orthodoxy from his protestant perspective -- dealing frankly with the frequency of nationalism and even racism in orthodox churches -- but nonetheless trying to appreciate its many fine qualities . clendenin does not have the space to go into much depth on any of these topics , however . i was not too impressed by the book . much of the work is repetitive , and in a volume of only 180 pages such repetition makes the work very insubstantial indeed . clendenin also makes several errors which caused me to doubt his familiarity with the history of the church . he writes , for example , that the slavs were converted in 988 , when this marked only the conversion of kyiv rus and most slavs were already evangelised over a century earlier . his focus is entirely on the church in russia and greece/byzantium and the contributions of other regions are ignored . the work is written in a journalistic style with frequent resorts to quotations and a great deal of footnotes , suggesting that the author is not terribly specialised in the subject at hand . for westerners curious about orthodoxy , i think there is no better introduction than kallistos ware 's the orthodox church , an instant classic when it was first published over forty years ago , and available in a relatively new updated edition . clendenin 's work is admirable for its attempt to build dialogue between protestants and orthodox , but his work is really too short
