gave it one star because i could n't give it zero there are two types of writers ... one writes to inform the reader , the other writes to try to impress other writers . mr. reese tried the latter , but did n't acomplish either . reading this book is like trying to understand a sloppy drunk stranger explaining why his wife left him ... .it does n't make sense and it 's b-o-r-i-n-g . it 's ironic that a frenchman with a german mother , who also spent wwii in the german army on the eastern front and who never claimed to be a writer ( guy sajer ) , wrote the book that is everything that reese 's book wanted to be , and is n't . if you are looking for the ultimate `` ca n't put it down '' memoir of a soldier that brings home the horrors of war along with humanity at it 's best and worst , get `` forgotten soldier '' by guy sager . like coke , it 's the real thing
