s is for slow read normally , i find it hard to put a sue grafton book down once i get started . not the case with `` s '' . i did not enjoy the plot about violet and her abusive husand . the main character violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs , red hair , just a boozing slut over all . i did n't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her . the ending was n't clear either . i did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades . most of the characters just were n't that interesting overall . i missed her interactions with rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor , the handsome 80 year old baker henry . usually , there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here . i would vote pass on this one .
