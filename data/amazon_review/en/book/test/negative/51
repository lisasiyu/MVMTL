poor analogies , and no real argument vanishing voices does a good job of showing how larger languages are destroying smaller ones , and the methods of language death . this is all pretty much common knowledge . however , the authors fail in their attempt to give a reason as to why language death is something with which we should be concerned . the only argument they put forth is in a ecological/enviromental analogy , which says that biological diversity is good and stable , therefore , linguistic diversity must . however , they only go part way in their analogy and reject natural selection for languages . they also show that linguistic diversity corresponds to environmental diversity , but state this has nothing to do with the inexcessiblity of the areas . the violin-playing and loaded words are hard to stomach if you are looking for good social science . i would not suggest the book unless you are an ecological activist wanting to try to link your cause with `` saving cultures '' or with yet another critique of the west
