'wise , ' but debatably 'quaker' appreciate the stories told by this author about his life and consider the insights that he has gained from reflection on his experience ; but , please , do not base your understanding of quakerism on his presentation . in spite of the fact that smith is a lifelong friend and a former quaker educator , he quotes george fox ( an important leader in the early quaker movement ) and the bible inaccurately or out of context several times . in addition , some of smith 's statements about facets of quaker faith and practice are historically unfounded or ignore the diversity within the religious society of friends today . if you are interested in learning about quakerism , read wilmer a. cooper 's book , a living faith : an historical study of quaker beliefs ( friends united press : 1990 ) . read robert lawrence smith 's book as a book of wisdom written by a quaker , but not necessarily a quaker book of wisdom
