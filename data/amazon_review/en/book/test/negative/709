crops , crops and more crops i had to read jared diamond 's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim . the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important . however , there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns , germs ( more than the other 2 ) , and steel . of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns , germs and steel . i enjoyed parts of the book considerably , but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book . i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs , `` collapse '' - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history . it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now . -rk
