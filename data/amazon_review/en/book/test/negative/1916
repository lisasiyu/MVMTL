a disappointing read this book had the potential to be very good but in the end , it is quite average . the author 's worst enemy is himself . for some unknown reason , reidy feels the need to make some sort of joke or wisecrack once every six sentences . this interrupts the flow of the story and , most importantly , the jokes quit being funny around page 12 . and on top of that , the constant attempts at humor create a sense that the author is lying about many things . i am not sure why reidy felt the need to constantly make jokes ( self-deprecating and otherwise ) but it absolutely ruined the entire story . after a while , you will begin to think he is making up half the stories he tells . in all , a very disappointing read .
