weight loss is not permanent ! i found out that there is n't any difference with adkins for life from the first book . disappointing , i tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results . however , i never support anything unless i have been convinced it truly does what it says and i found that with `` the average joes diet . '' a friend told me about it and i was always considered the fat girl . no longer ! and it 's stayed off .
