claire messud is no tom wolfe by setting her story in manhattan , among the literary elite , claire messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of tom wolfe 's `` bonfire of the vanities , '' which described upper-class life in manhattan among the wall street elite , so exquisitely that character descriptions from his 1987 book ( `` master of the universe '' and `` social skeleton '' ) became part of our vocabulary . claire messud is no tom wolfe . `` the emperor 's children '' describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of `` the emperor , '' a famous writer . unlike `` bonfire of the vanities , '' this book has no compelling narrative - the `` voice '' shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want , who they need and who they love or hate and why . trust me , you wo n't care . meanwhile , the `` emperor '' lopes along as a literary lion past his prime . the characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals ( the `` emperor '' betrays his wife with his daughter 's best friend , the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the `` emperor '' etc . etc . ) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on september 11 , 2001 . but we never learn how september 11 affected messud 's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere .
