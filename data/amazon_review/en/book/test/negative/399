ugggh i 've read every one of iris johansen 's `` suspense '' novels and have loved most of them . the last couple though have been so painful to get through . this one however , i do n't think i can even finish . i read where someone called these characters `` cardboard , '' and i could n't agree more . the female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist . whereas in the eve duncan books and the wind dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters , it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class . `` now this should happen here , and this here , and this here and boom , climax , happily every after . '' i hope that iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time .
