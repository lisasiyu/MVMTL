wast of money it is because of this book and the other books james fetzer wrote with his dishonest pack , that people have lost so much interest in the jfk assassination . honest authors like harold weisberg and david wrone attract less attention because they only published what they could prove and not what they dream up . the z-film was altered , many know this , the warren commission published it in volume 18 ( 18h1-84 ) with frames missing . in case you do n't know this , that counts as alteration . z-film tampering was not to the extent that fetzer claims such as painting jackie 's face on the film itself . the film was not stolen , or doctored up in anyway . no one would be dumb enough to take that risk
