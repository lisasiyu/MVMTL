great bogus ! sallie ann glassman is not a mambo ! she does attempt to pimp lwa for her performances and for her weekly `` ceremonies '' . any serious mambo and hougan ( and even practitioner of haitian vodou ) will laugh when they hear the following : sallie ann glassman 's `` house '' does not have grades ! traditional haitian vodou knows 3 grades of initiation ! sallie ann glassman does not perform the priye ginea because it was catholic ... she opted for an invocation to the four directions and four elements lifted from either the oto or wicca or enochian tradition , but done in french , to sound like creole - so the average tourist would not know that it was just some invocation from another tradition that had nothing to do with vodou . when she takes people to haiti for initiation ( remember : no grades ! ) she gives them pot tets filled with a feather and 2 or 3 other items . she does not teach passwords or handshakes to her initiates - who , again , have not received any grade ! to make a long story short , this book and the author are great bogus and have nothing to do with real haitian vodou
