impressive , but not useful i bought the moosewood restaurant low-fat favorites cookbook by the moosewood collective and put out by clarkson potter publishers in 1996 , because i 'd heard that this was a famous vegetarian restaurant chain with great food , and knew about it since the `` headquarters '' restaurant is located in ithaca , new york , where i went to school . at first , the recipes , such as mushroom polenta pie , looked pretty good to me and not too hard to make , but beyond that , i found that a great deal of asian-inspired recipes , including five spice rice and lentil sambar were too exotic and complicated to make for my taste , and the costly ingredients for various dinner recipes were often hard to find at my non-upscale , local grocery store . though i liked moosewood 's recipe for `` oven fries , '' i could have easily gotten that off the internet . and many moosewood recipes just started looking time-consuming . have i really wanted to make complicated tunisian potato turnovers involving no less than 14 ingredients for my dinner on any weekday ? not really . the curried sweet potato roti recipe needs 19 ingredients and the tamale pie asks for an astounding 26 . so , on the whole , i was disappointed with this book . though i 'm sure the restaurant food is pretty tasty because moosewood shows it knows how to flavor vegetables in innovative ways , i do n't recommend this book to people who need simple tasty , vegetable meals on a daily basis while on the go . this book might be more useful for entertaining guests on weekends , when you have more time and are feeling more adventurous
