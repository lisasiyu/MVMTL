nitty gritty but not much ! i am disappointed with this cookbook . i was looking for a basic cookbook to explain times and techniques to cook standard items in a toaster oven . what i call the `` nitty gritty '' of using a toaster oven . obviously i am wrong , the book contains nothing basic , standard or instructional about using a toaster oven
