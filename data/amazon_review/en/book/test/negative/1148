well written but tedious this is my 3rd pd james book and i have to say i was quite disappointed . ( the other 2 were murder room and a certain justice . ) i found most of the characters to be not terribly believable and one dimensional . even dalgliesh was not well drawn . and to make it worse , the plot was not believable . i agree with someone else who said borrow this from the library , do n't buy it .
