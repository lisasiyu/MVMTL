the most disgusting character ever i actually read this entire book just to see if/how beatrice would get what was coming to her . yes , the book is about incest . the ads and cover i 've seen for this book state something like `` murder , incest , betrayal '' or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest . the thing i did n't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex . sex scene after sex scene . i frankly belive it 's better to leave it to the imagination . we all know what happens when you have sex . but really it seemed more wrong that beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love . it was n't just the incest that was gross . gregory 's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times . after everything , i think what beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts i 've ever read . this book was at the most okay and i do not recommend it
