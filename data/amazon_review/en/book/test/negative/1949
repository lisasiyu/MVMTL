uninformed i belive that the author of this book is blaming society , especially universities , a little too much . in the beginning when he makes this assertion that universites are racist he basis it on the astute obervation that since there a few african americans in the universities that they are racist or something like that . furthmore since the military has more african americans it is a better instiution . here is a better explanation . universities are a lot more selective and thus can choose from the entire population . the army will take anyone it can get its hands on . i just did not like the authors atitutde that the whole is racist . furthermore he knows nothing about music . i love when he writes white soldiers are listening to more black music and he uses heavy metal and rock n roll , both white music ! in fact heavy metal is white protest music against black music ! do some research or think before writting a book
