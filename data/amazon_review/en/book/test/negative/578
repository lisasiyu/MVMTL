one sorry excuse for a book this was assigned for summer reading in freshman yr at my college . i ca n't believe gibberish stuff like this gets published . kingston 's past accounts were boring to read about , at times confusing with all the muti-named relatives . the events were and pointless and just blah . i tried to make it to the end of the book , but sadly i did n't . it was just too boring ! i would give this less than one star if i could . do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague .
