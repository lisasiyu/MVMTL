readalbe but junky timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco . it 's an indulgent bit of junk food . timeline starts with a hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of new mexico - an intriguing idea , but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters . there are so many preposterous story elements that it 's just really difficult to take seriously . the story is ever-predictable and ludicrous . but , a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you 're real hungry . go back and read andromeda strain .
