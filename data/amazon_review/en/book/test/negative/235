worst book i bought on amazon i did not like this book at all . i speak clearly but i want to be more articulate and hold my `` audiences '' attention . the breathing exercises and banging out the zzzzs and ee-i-ee-i-oos did not help me . maybe i just do n't understand what the author is trying to get across so it could actually be good information . i also agree with one of the earlier reviewers that this author seems to just drop a lot of names . it got a little old after a while
