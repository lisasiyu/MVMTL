not the `` building web-site guide '' you may look for if you are that `` dummy '' who wants to know how to build a web-site , then this is not the book for you . it tells you hardly how to build , it tells more about links which can help you making your web-site look more cool . you have to have some html cq dreamweaver experience to understand the context of what the writer wants to clarify . by reading the book and going through the enclosed cd rom with ty-out software , i soon came to the conclusion that the title of the book is somewhat misleading . see comments above why . if you are that `` dummy '' who has not a single thread of knowledge about building web-sites , then do not buy this book . not giving it 1 star ( but i was close ) , there are some interesting chapters in this reference giude , but typing what you want to have inside your web-site ( links and related web-sites with loads of info what comprises around 50 % of the book ) . you will get the same information from any search engine . recommendation : concentrate first on a book , that teaches you the basic html-programming language , continue then with either a dreamweaver/frontpage manual . you 're much better off..
