the translation is a problem - the stories are not my introduction to borges was through the collection labyrinths . i immediately fell in love with the stories , the prose , the poetry , and so went on to buy this complete volume . while it is nice to have all borges 's stories in one place , and at a reasonable price , the language does n't really hold up for me . the translation is ... well , not sloppy , but too simple , like those childrens ' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in 5th grade . i have nothing against andrew hurley , but his translation of borges leaves me cold . i 'd give borges 5 stars out of 5 , but hurley ? no more than 2 .
