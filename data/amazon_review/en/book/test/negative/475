really bad ending i liked this book up until the ending . i expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable ( it 's what i thought was going to happen ) , but at least satisfying and believable considering the power grisham gave the cia throughout this entire book . instead , the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me
