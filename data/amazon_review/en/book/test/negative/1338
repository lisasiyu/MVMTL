disappointing while i do n't believe a writer has to follow in his/her own footsteps and write the same type of books over and over , this departure by adriana trigiani is not successful . while it has the obligatory trip to italy , it makes little or nothing of the trip and since a decorator is making the trip , i would have thought that she would have included a wealth of description here . instead the trip is glossed over and we are treated to only those descriptions of ottomans and fabric that adorn the homes of di crespi 's new jersey clients . the book is filled with caricatures and not characters and no new jersey italian stereotype is left unturned . not much of a story and the main character is rather boring as well . if you insist on reading it , save your money and go to the library
