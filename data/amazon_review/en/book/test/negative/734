old news this book was n't that good.. in fact it is n't just good . the topic has been covered before and , to me , it was like i was reading those portions again only drawn out . there was nothing new to the story or even the way the author told it . i regret having bought the book and not sure i would recommend it even for someone to check out , free , at a library
