newer is not better the newer editions of the delorme atlases are much inferior to , and skimpier on data , than their older editions . i assume they did this to save on printing costs . the maps contain only about half of the data that the older additions had . for example , in the new editions there are elevations listed for only the highest peaks , few of which are even named , and there is no data about mines or springs or many of the other features that the old editions included . other than the newly added gps coordiante data , they are just glorified road maps , which you can get at the gas station . i own several of these from many years back , but am very disappointed in the new editions
