tired and worn out i was n't sure if i was reading a new novel , or just re-reading one of several of the last catherine coulter novels i 've waded through . i think that i am truly sick of the big , strong man caring for sick , injured woman bit . the story was dumb ; there was no real mystery . i love the & quot ; song & quot ; series and most of the sherbrooke brides series . this was plain disappointing
