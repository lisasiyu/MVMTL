sadly dissapointed i was very excited to read this book ! i ran home , got comforable and started reading . i found myself skipping through the pages . i found it was very myth based , and too much about religion and jesus and mary . i bought it because i love tori and have been fascinated by her . i wish this book was more about her life , her childhood . i have read less then half this book , and i will either force myself to finish , or return the book . i really am sadly dissapointed . tori is the singer and song writer that you can listen to over and over again . i have bought her cd 's 3 and 4 times each because i listened too much and the cd was worn . i really do n't suggest anyone to buy this , you will be let down , just as i was .
