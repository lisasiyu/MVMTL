same rah rah stuff i received a promotional copy in the mail , and i thank the author for that , since i did n't waste any money on it . this is a truly unoriginal book . after reading the first few pages , i could see where it was going . i scribbled a few ideas on a piece of paper and started flipping forward through the book . sure enough , he hit every one , and not much else . this is another rehashing of every rah-rah book you 've read on sales , and there are many hundreds of them . i 've read several dozen of them , and they all sound the same after a while . the real problem with a book like this is that there might actually be something new in here , but i 'd never want to spend the time reading to find it . typical sections : you got ta ... visualize success you got ta ... think like a winner you got ta ... sell yourself you got ta ... go the extra mile you got ta ... use the power of numbers you got ta ... do better than this to sell this book
