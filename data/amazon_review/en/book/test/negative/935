get the book instead i am big fan of pax ( armstrong 's company ) and i own her book , cds , and have attended her seminars . i really liked keys to the kingdom in the book version , however , friends and family that listened to the book on cd hated it . not sure why exactly , but my recommendation is save a few bucks and get the book instead . also , you should be warned that her work can initially seem anti-feminist . hang in there though , because her message is meant to actually empower women in relationships . i ca n't tell you how much she forever changed my view and relationships with men . did i also mention that apparently alanis morissette is also an armstrong fan ? in a nutshell , get her book , and her other cds like `` in sync with the opposite sex '' . also , her cd `` the amazing development of men '' is a very condensed version of the concepts taught in `` keys to the kingdom '' , which usually you can get for free if you attend one of her teaser seminars
