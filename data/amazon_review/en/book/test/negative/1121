more jerry fallwell **** unfortunately for the morons who continue to churn out these silly little tracts ( i wo n't insult `` books '' by calling this that ) the only one of our `` founding fathers '' who ever wanted anything even resembling a christian nation ( the phrase he used was `` christian sparta '' ) was patrick henry , and he did n't even sign the constitution ! the other founders from jefferson to franklin were deists , freebelievers , agnostics , atheists , or at the very least non-comformists like george washington . who , despite `` belonging '' to a church requiring it ( martha 's ) , never took commmunion in his entire life . jefferson who rewrote the bible , editing out any of the magical `` donkey 's can talk , people can fly , and a man named jesus lives up in the sky '' nonsense so dear to christians , certainly was n't a xtian . adams said that the only thing that came out of religion and the state interacting was tyranny . geez kids i hate to burst you `` holier than thou '' bubble but america is n't a christian nation , has never been a christian nation , and as long as truely freedom-loving people have breath in their body will never be a christian nation
