focus mr.warren seems to have trouble focusing on the subject matter in the first half of this book , making it seem to be merely a digest of fantasy and science fiction . i guess one can enjoy this book if you are open minded , very open minded . there are however more serious and factual findings on this subject for the more serious ufo fans . if you must buy the book , save your cash and buy the paperback
