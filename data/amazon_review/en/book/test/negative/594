rusty fiction . to all who have read this malarkey , and for those who intend to , i have a suggestion . first , read all the articles by tim callahan of skeptic magazine . he is an authentic scholar who specializes in debunking revisionism and bigotry . since he like mr. cahill is irish the 3-5 star reviewers will not be able to condemn him for being anti-irish . he makes certain , unlike cahill that he has a mountain of proof-evidence to verify his thesis . i was so impressed with his methods that it truly surprised me that some people actually fell for this book . in fact he used every point that the 1-2 star reviewers mentioned , and more . i agree with him that the entire `` hinges of history series '' largely lacks any in depth research . the first 3 chapters of this book is devoted to rehashing what most of us learned in grade school . the next 2 chapters are clearly the authors reinterpretations of the period . the rest of the book felt padded . what does plato have to do with the title , or premise ? where are the footnotes and sources ? that makes everything dubious at best . also , cahill did make archie bunker type remarks about other groups that have no place in our society , except in a very tasteless jokebook . read callahan first , or in place of this rusty fiction .
