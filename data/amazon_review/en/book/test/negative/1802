inflammatory , there are better books out there on the subject the things that most struck me was the book was more `` attacking '' than setting up positive models . i found the language to be quite inflammatory and harsh . this made it very unpleasant to read . for a much better book on house-churches , try `` houses that change the world '' by wolfgang simson
