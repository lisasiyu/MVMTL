ponnuru is all mixed up , right from his book 's title ! title begins : `` the party of death : the democrats ... '' just tonight - august 14 , 2006 - while being interviewed about this book on the colbert report , ponnuru *clarified* that what he calls `` the party of death '' is really a collective of all who are pro abortion , regardless of political party ! ponnuru explained that he knows it 's not all democrats that are pro abortion , and he openly admitted there are republicans who are pro abortion ! so colbert asked ponnuru if he had also included the word `` republican '' on the book 's cover ( to be fair ) to show that some republicans are in ponnuru 's collective `` party of death '' , and ponnuru said no , he did not include the word `` republican '' on his book 's cover , and colbert then asked that maybe ponnuru did n't have enough ink to print the word `` republican '' on the cover , or maybe ponnuru did n't think he had enough room on the cover to include the word `` republicans '' along with `` democrats '' for the reader to understand his collective `` party of death , '' which again , according to ponnuru on national tv , is a group category that includes all who are pro abortion , not just democrats . yet the inside flap of this book asks , is the democratic party the `` party of death '' ? does ponnuru even know what he 's talking about when he 's this mixed up , completely contradicting his book 's cover and inside flap on national tv ?
