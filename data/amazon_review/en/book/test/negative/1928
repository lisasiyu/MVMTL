no information for black women , racist this book is not for people of color . paula begoun only devotes 10 pages to information regarding black hair , and actually has the audicity to say , `` suffice it to say that the natural state of black hair is currently not an acceptable fashion statement for women of color . '' is she crazy ? ? ? this statement is extremely offensive . ( would anyone ever say almond shaped eyes are unacceptable on asian people ? ) this is a part of our genetics and our looks . does paula notice all of the models , actresses , singers and even politicians who are black ( women ) who wear their hair natural ? ? ? even white people and asian people try to braid/lock their hair to look like ours ! ! if she thinks natural black hair is unacceptable , then she should not write books abour hair care , and go live by herself on an island ( which is obviously where she has been ) . paula sweetie , stop sniffing hair care products..
