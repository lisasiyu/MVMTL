rehash of a second rate sci-fi horror movie walter mosley 's `` easy rawlins '' series is well plotted , the characters are well thought out , and the stories are very original . i am a fan of his new `` fearless jones '' series , which does a lot to explain racism in 1950s los angeles . nothing i 've read about walter mosley explains why he would want to write this piece of trite . this book is the worst rehash of bad 1950s sci-fi movies that i 've read in years . i 've been reading sci-fi for forty years and this is about as bad as it gets . the story is totally trash , you know the ending before you get past the beginning , the characters are ridiculous , and the sex scenes are even worse ( hard to ruin sex , but he does it ) . if this was by anyone else it never would have gotten published . it would be a favor to him and all his fans to buy back every copy that exists and bury them
