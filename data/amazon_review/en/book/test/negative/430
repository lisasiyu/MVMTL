series hits a brick wall this is the third installment in the mitch rapp series and the author 's fourth book overall . ( i 'd suggest reading the previous books both for chronology reasons and that they 're better reads . ) mitch is america 's # 1 `` go to '' guy when it comes to fighting terrorism . in `` separation of power '' he is faced with cleaning up some open issues from his last mission ( someone tried to kill him ) , the political `` in-fighting '' surrounding the naming of a new cia chief , rogue mossad agents , iraq gaining nuclear weapons and falling in love . one could be forgiven in thinking this last issue would make for a pleasant diversion while our hero prevents ww iii . not so . mitch 's romance takes a front and center position and in a word is well ... comedic . the `` action '' threads of the plot - which this author has worked so well in his previous books - is hinted at in the first 100 pages , does n't really begin until after 200 pages - and then proceeds in fits and starts . there is an inordinate amount of `` character development '' - self-serving , amoral , scheming politicans & our world weary , battle scarred reluctant hero mitch , who must once again pick up the sword to do what no other man can do - which like the `` romance '' impedes the plot . the book hastily concludes , ( 20+ pages ) , in an unsatisfying and simplistic finale . hopefully this book is an anomaly in the series because the author 's previous books were great roller coaster rides and provided entertaining reading at the beach and in airports . unfortunately the much rushed conclusion and mitch 's `` new '' situation does n't guarantee that .
