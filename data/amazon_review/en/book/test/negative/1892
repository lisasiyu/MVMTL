not exactly what i expected i read this book because i really enjoyed southgate 's the fall of rome . third girl from the left ; however , is no fall of rome . southgate attempts to create a link between three generations of women from the same family by imbuing each of them with a love film . despite her valiant attempt , the stories just do n't come together well . yes , each of the characters finds escape/ solace at the movies , but in spite of this common link , as well as the link of emotional distance between mothers/daughters , and artistic aspirations , there are too many distractions in the book to make it work well . southgate tries to cram too much into one book- a cursory look at the infamous tulsa race riots ; an exploration of black women and lesbianism/sexuality ; familial estrangement ; and the history of the blaxploitation movement in film . an entire novel could be written about any one of these topics , but to shove them altogether in one novel , gives short shrift to them all .
