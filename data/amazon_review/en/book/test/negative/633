i 'm returning this book i bought this book based on its rating . unfortunately , virtually every page of this book is half blank . furthermore , there are many unnecessary blank lines within the text page . the format of this book is like for third grade . also , the author uses java code along with his text . but at the end of each chapter , he uses c++ code as a duplication of the java code . if you want to know and learn design patterns , make sure you look at & quot ; software architecture design patterns in java & quot ; by partha kuchana . this book covers 42 design patterns including the 23 gof patterns . also , you might like to look at & quot ; core j2ee patterns & quot ; second edition by alur , crupi , amd malks
