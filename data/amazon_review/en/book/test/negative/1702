flat , but fast this book was something that i read in one day , just to pass the time . i really did n't care about the characters , and lara seemed just too unreal to be true . she was too much of scarlet o'hara in her dealings with a real estate world dominated by men . i only finished it to find out what crisis happened that gave her an empty birthday party , but when i finally came to the end , it was n't too satisfying
