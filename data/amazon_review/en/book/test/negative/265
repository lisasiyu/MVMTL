do n't waste 3 hours of lifespan reading this book this book is widely known as a classic , but the reader is left wondering `` why ? '' protagonist ( ca n't call him a hero ) of this novel is poor farmer ethan frome , who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife . he finds some `` excitement '' when mattie comes to visit , but again , the reader wonders why , because she 's vapid and uninteresting . to recap : we 're presented with characters that are n't the least bit likable to begin with , and turn pages eagerly waiting for the happy ending . instead , wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable . i feel like i wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book . why ? ? ?
