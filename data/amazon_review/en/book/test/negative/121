ooh-la not alicia drake writes well , that 's a given - she 's a journalist . she makes all the excess of paris during the 1970 's and early 80 's come very much to life . cocaine , heroin , disco , silk and lace . but the main argument of her book , that karl lagerfeld and yves saint laurent are both sociopaths is not that earth shattering . after all , who is she intending to enlighten by this book : middle america ? - they could care less - the fashionistas ? - they already know all this stuff . drake does n't seem to understand that when writing a biography the last thing you want to do is create it in a vacuum . in the end , i did n't know anything more about lagerfeld and ysl than i did when i began this turgid ice-capade . the two enigmas remain enigmatic . her threads are stretched beyond their breaking points through their endless repetition and as with all fashion journalism , there 's a heavy air of self-hatred and revenge hanging over the whole endeavor
