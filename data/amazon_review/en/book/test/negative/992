uncle isaac asimov tells it as it is . after the 1700s , this play fell into obscurity . it was later revived in the mid 1900s . its period of obscurity does not surprise me . believe me , i am a champion for shakespeare 's underrated `` timon of athens '' and `` coriolanus . '' i honestly tried to like this play , but i was forced to concur with the great isaac asimov who said : `` though it ends happily and is therefore technically a comedy , it lacks a carefree fun and happiness of the previous comedies . it is , indeed , rather an unpleasant play ... '' well , onto the play . we meet the widowed countess , her son bertram , and the elder lafew . we learn that the king is ill and quite possibly terminal . possibly , helena 's father could have cured the king , but alas , he is dead . the countess gives bertram some advice that is not so far from the advice polonius gave ophelia . ( though the bumbling polonius ends up being easier to like ! ) helena loves bertram , but feels beneath him and contemplates virginity . one comical moment is when parolles reveals that in a way , virginity is a form of vain self love . later , helena cures the king , and helena asks for bertram as a husband . now this is where i have a problem . bertram is made out to be a villain . but how can we possibly not sympathize with him ? maybe helena deserves something for saving the king , but does she really have the right to impose marriage on someone who does n't like her ? well , bertram is forced to go through with the marriage , but he quickly decides to help florence against siena . poor parolles who knows this forced marriage was unethical is constantly made a subject of ridicule in this play . this is where i have another problem . rather than the clever misunderstandings of `` the comedy of errors , '' the clever marital confrontations and errors in `` midsummer night 's dream , '' or the comical and clever passages from jaques in `` as you like it , '' the comedy in `` all 's well that ends well '' is reduced to the lowest possible form . ( flat out ridicule ! it is interesting that in the word ridicule , we have the letters for cruel , but i am digressing . ) in one decent elemenet of comedy , bertram makes it clear that he would rather go to war than lie with his wife . ( and perhaps in time , bertram can appeal to the king to release him from this marriage . it would n't be unheard of . ) one interesting thing is that bertram remains honorable in the sense that he does not 'ravish ' helena . he does n't love her , and therefore will not engage in sex . it is rather repulsive on his mother 's part how she fails to understand the situation . even if she was on helena 's side , she might at least understand bertram 's frustration in that he did not consent to the marriage . ( and possibly try to at least talk things over in hopes of coming to a peaceful solution . ) but no . she just rants and raves . later the countess reads a letter from helena stating that she will leave so bertram can come home from the war . this throws bertram 's mother into yet another rage on helena 's behalf , and perhaps moves the reader into sympathy with helena . that is , until our good old uncle isaac asimov points out the hypocrisy of helena : `` helena is not quite as unselfish as she is presenting herself to be . she does not go to the shrine at all but sneaks off to florence in disguise as a pilgrim hoping that she may yet return her reluctant husband . '' well , onward . in florence , helena meets with diana ( whom bertram loves ) . and helena thinks she can trick bertram into making her pregnant . we then have the cruel practical joke on parolles where he is blindfolded and threatened to reveal military secrets ( to friendly forces of course ) or else . perhaps even shakespeare felt bad over this scene as he has parolles say : `` who can not be crushed with a plot ? '' ( 4.3.340 ) . we also see bertram try to win the affections of diana . diana of course feels nothing for bertram . but again , the hypocrisy of the play is prevalent . if we accept the fact that bertram should respect diana 's wishes that she does n't love him , how do we account for the fact that helena imposed an unwanted marriage on bertram ? but of course diana consents to meet bertram and of course it will really be helena who meets him . but even tricking bertram into getting her pregnant is not enough . helena decides to throw a sympathy party for herself by spreading the word of her death back home . now in `` much ado about nothing , '' hero had a valid excuse for staging her death . she was humiliated and disgraced in front of several people for something she was totally innocent of . but helena was the one who imposed an unwanted marriage on bertram , and she still wants a sympathy party . one redeeming element of the play is that lafew shows some sympathy for the disgraced parolles and offers him a job . and of course , in the end bertram feels bad over helena 's staged death and is happy to see her alive again . helena may very well be the britney spears of shakespeare 's characters .
