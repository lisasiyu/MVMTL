wrong content for young children first , i hardly ever write reviews ... but after this story , i needed to state something . second , i am not considered a conservative and relatively open minded . third , i always appreciate history and culture ... and understand this story was handed down through generations . however , never reading this story myself and reading it to my three and a half year old for the first time - i had to stop half way through the book after realizing the heart of the story surrounds a monkey killing a baby owl and the jungle searches for the killer while the mother owl grieves . to complement the story , there is an illustration of the monkey ( snarl showing sharp teeth ) hitting the baby owl over the head with a branch ... not a bedtime story for this family . it was given as a gift , and will be returned shortly..
