the book shows a cult celebrity who is indeed overly full of himself the way idle in his book badly treats anyone who saw his performance but did n't care for it shows how truly stuck up he is . everyone over 10 who watches his performances has to believe he 's every bit as great as he thinks he is or he gets negative about it . the drawing of idle as a lady is thankfully missing from the new paperback version . to the most recent reviewer here before me i say this . george harrison was part of the arguably biggest bunch of musicians in history ( the beatles ) . there was a moment in the 1960 's when almost every youngster in the us , england and australia between 13 and 18 years of age was into the beatles . there was never a moment when the pythons had such a fan following . comparisons between beatles and pythons are ridiculous . when idle 's time comes the only people who 'll blab about him in their own books would be the surviving pythons ( even carol cleveland )
