an easy read to kill the time , but not much more reading dark harbor is like watching a mediocre tv show that you ca n't be bothered to turn off . i listened to dark harbor as an audio book , so i do n't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because i `read it ' while i was doing other things that had to be done anyway , like driving . if you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - dark harbor is not for you . this novel is about as innovative as an episode of murder she wrote . to illustrate : stone barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim 's wrong hand . ( i think i actually saw that one on murder she wrote ) woods either ca n't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply does n't care . it is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in dark harbor . this is n't because the clues come together in any logical way , but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel . you can just tell . this does n't mean that the solution makes sense . in fact , there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced . it is as if woods could n't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through . woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do ( except of course , to have sex with stone ) . holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island . on her second trip she has an obligatory romp with stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel . why was she kidnapped ? i do n't think anyone - including woods - can answer that question in any plausible way . my theory is that woods needed to work holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages . it also allowed him to include holly 's dad ( another regular character ) in her search . wood 's motive seems obvious . the kidnapper 's motive however is n't - her kidnapping makes no sense . but clearly this was something woods did n't think was worth worrying about . the best i can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read ( of course , in my case it was read to me ) . it may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read ( and certainly not to buy ) - but as an audio book from the library ( with a limited selection of audio books to choose from ) it helped me pass the time in traffic .
