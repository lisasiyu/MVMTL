a history text okay- i know that this is a seminal work re : the middle east , but it is as dry as any other history text that you might find on the shelves of middleeast 101 . in comparison to price of honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region , it pales in comparison
