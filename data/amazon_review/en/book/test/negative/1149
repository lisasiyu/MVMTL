more is less too long-winded . too many seldom-encountered words employed . too much evasiveness by the author , in withholding clear meaning from what he was saying rather than transmitting that meaning to the reader readily , willingly , succinctly and immediately . a painful reading experience , not an enjoyable one , unfortunately . the author seemed to be trying to prove his cleverness , superiority and literary prowess ( all of which he clearly possesses ) rather than simply telling a story . it was a relief to get this book over with . the story was good , but the author took too long to tell it , with too many asides and meanderings . this book is maybe a good lesson in why authors ought to try to be brief , clear , succinct . authors will be taking up the reader 's time without paying the reader for that time , and also are locking diligent readers into having to finish a story once they start reading it , and the author does n't have an automatic right to more time than the story deserves . did this story really need 470 pages of tight-set text ?
