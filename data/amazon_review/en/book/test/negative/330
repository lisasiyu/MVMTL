how annoying this book is divided into chapters with different religio-social related themes such as `` god '' , `` money '' , `` power '' , `` love '' etc . for each theme , the author presents a few movies relating to it . it did n't take long to realize that higgins is a liberal christian who seems more concerned with political ideologies than the salvation of souls . the values promoted are christian to a degree but only those that overlap with modern liberalism . higgins got annoying fast by constantly criticizing the church ( which i think he means evangelical christians ) though he does n't name names . and the reason for the criticism is that they do n't uphold the 'true message ' of christianity which is that even more annoying buzz word 'social justice ' and liberal ethics in general . higgins uses the typical method of judging the 'church ' for judging other 's behaviors as sinful . the subtitle `` finding spiritual fingerprints in culturally significant films '' itself is somewhat disturbing . the movie industry is the last place we should hope to find much true spirituality . it is overridden with everything contrary to christianity . saying that some of these movies have the fingerprints of god ( i know he does n't actually say that , but its implied ) is to overlook the other prevalent messages in these movies that are ungodly to the core . even a small amount of arsenic in a glass of water is deadly . so even though i do watch movies , i am very cautious to see much holiness in them . for as much as i did n't like the book , it did introduce me to some new movies which i have now watched and enjoyed .
