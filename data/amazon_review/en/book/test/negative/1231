nasty and profane this is a horrible book written from a very nasty point of view . basically , this is a systematic dismantling of everything sacred about judaism - to the point where the author actually uses the sacred name of god in the book . obviously , the author knew that his use of the name of god would deeply insult those devoutly jewish , and just as obviously , the author did not care if he insults deeply held beliefs . it 's important to understand that this is coming from a man that feels that what is now israel will soon no longer exist as the jewish homeland - and he demonstrates absolutely no concern for that , either . no concern for the basics of the jewish religion , disdain for the jewish homeland , and disdain for the future of the jewish race . anti-religion , anti-judaism , anti-israel . there 's a word for that
