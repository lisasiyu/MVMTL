no closure - it 's 1st in a series look i enjoyed the book a lot , but got nearer and nearer to the end and noticed the plot was n't wrapping up . i got that awful sinking feeling that i had been suckered into a book without a good ending , without closure , which i hate . sure enough ! at the bottom of the last page they *finally* admit `` armageddon 's children ends here . the story will continue with the publication of terry brooks 's next novel . '' nowhere on the front cover , back cover or anywhere else but on the last page does it mention this . i hate being manipulated , and that 's why i gave the book one star , and why the publisher del ray/ballantine books will never get another cent from me
