sue miller needs to give readers some credit who is her editor ? the main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea . we got it . we do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say . i felt , as the reader , that the author did not trust me to `` get '' her own work . it would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit . not to mention , if she grew up in a cold family , with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality , i did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression .
