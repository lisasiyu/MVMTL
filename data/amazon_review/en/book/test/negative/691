desperate housewives prequel i thought this was one of the worst books i ever attempted to read . the whole plot is just plain ridiculous . bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime . when the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years . such rubbish -- do n't people see how contrived and unrealistic , not to mention immoral , this is ? avoid this one
