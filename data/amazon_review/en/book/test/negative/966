one sided view . as expected , anything coming from victor ostrovsky will be negative and against israel . the book is filled with real events , which the author dramatically changed and turned israel responsible for them . no wonder this book is banned in israel . in fact , because of the ban , many people believe that this book has true accounts of mossad activities . true , the book gets interesting , but the author 's motive to run down the israel for everything happening around the world spoils it . this book is a perfect example of blaming a country and its intelligence agency for your own mistakes . i absolutely agree with j . a magill 's review , this book has no credible source of information , except the fact that ostrovsky once worked for mossad . vindictiveness is the word behind this book . absolutely one sided , and nothing to prove what author says . all i can say is that i want my money and most importantly my time back . i doubt if i can have either .
