excellent content - unpleasant translation the book contains the complete works of arthur rimbaud in chronological order , in both english and french . there is an excellent short introduction to rimbaud , along with a very nice explanation of the translation process , and the difficulties inherent in translating poetry . sadly , the translations presented in this volume do a grave injustice to rimbaud . in his efforts to render an accurate contemporary translation , mason removes nearly every vestige of poetic rhythm and rhyme from his poems . even though my french is inadequate to enjoy rimbaud in his original language , i found myself turning frequently to the french versions of the poems , as i tried to understand how a poet of rimbaud 's reputation could possibly write so poorly . in poem after poem , the french version was more readable than mason 's translation even though i could only understand about a third of what i read . i ended up exchanging the book for a version translated by paul schmidt , which was much more readable . ironically , mason offers criticism of schmidt 's translation in his book . while this book might be a worthwhile addition to the library of someone already familiar with rimbaud , i would recommend that any person seeking an introduction to his poetry look elsewhere for a translation
