this book has no style . as a new bride , i thought this book was -- well -- let 's say -- -boring ! . no style..no design and these authors are `` lost '' as far as what brides want in the 21st century . if you are young , hip and cool , this book is not for you . if you are old on a 4th marriage , you might like it . also-warning ..these authors have terrible reviews on their baby bargains book . it seems they write all their own great reviews . i think martha stewart weddings is obviously much better and i also think i would not recommend a book from denise and alan field 's ever
