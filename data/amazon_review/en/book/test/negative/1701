not the best pj i 've read and often re-read most every pj book and column ever written . i 've always liked this guy . i keep his books after i 've read them instead of taking them to the local used book store . `` on the wealth of nations '' did not work . honestly , it sort of skidded into a ditch and got stuck from page one . it reads like the meeting minutes of a local book club . it 's not so much pj , it 's the concept of taking possibly one of the country 's biggest early day doorstops of a read and then having a top-end writer in the 21st century translate it with some political satire and humor for spin and flavor.. it just does n't land . what may compound it all is that pj 's writing does n't have quite the sharp edges on it as it used to . age brings that on in all of us . pj hasnt quite hit the grumpy ol ' man part of his career yet . to take a book like the wealth of nations and do a think-tank review on it is asking a lot of any author with any style or talent . pj gave it a go but honestly , i yawned a lot
