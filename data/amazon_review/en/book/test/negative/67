not worth the money i 'm a huge alton brown fan . this is one of the books i asked for when my birthday came around . i thought i wanted it after reading the reviews and thought it sounded good . i was very disappointed . while there is some good information in it , it 's mostly blank pages that you write your own recipes in w/ your notes . there are a few clear plastic pages so that you can put in recipe clippings and instructions and warranties for various kitchen gadgets , but a simple file folder would solve that . sadly , i will be returning this book and finding something else to purchase
