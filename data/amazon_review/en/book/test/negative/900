let down total control started really-really well for this reader ( nice premise/set-up ) . it had an even more compelling middle ( who ? who is the bad guy ? ? ) . the last third of the book imploded as i was pleading for lead character sydney to get `` done in '' by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying . nothing in this book added up well as it concluded . baldacci let me down on this one
