a bit disappointed i have read several of nicholas sparks ' books , but this one was different for me . it was a very very slow start . i was more than 150 pages into it before i got interested in the plot . i had even considered quitting reading it at times . it ended up being an okay story , but nothing that i could n't have lived without reading . what i did enjoy is the way mr. sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were . i would suggest another read from mr. sparks like `` the notebook '' or `` the wedding '' if you want a good romantic read .
