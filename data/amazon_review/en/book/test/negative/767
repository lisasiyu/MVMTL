big history , written small englishman tony judt 's postwar is an ambitious and worthwhile undertaking : to give a coherent account of the history of europe from 1945 . the outline of events is well known : a continent in ruins at the end of the second world war , the miraculous rise of western europe from the wreckage , the concurrent enslavement of the east , and thence the titanic struggle between the two world systems , culminating in the triumph of liberal democracy over totalitarian state control . it is a great story , surely one of the finest chapters in the history of human civilization . judt seems to take the view ( with which most people would likely agree ) that great shifts in history ultimately rest upon the underlying economics . in the big picture , communism failed because it was unproductive , capitalism succeeded because it was the opposite . the question he asks is a good one : why did it happen when it did ? why , after having survived so long ( since 1917 , in the case of the soviets ) did the eastern block suddenly collapse at the end of the eighties , and so rapidly ? his answer is , astonishingly , the helsinki accords . `` against all expectation , '' he claims , `` it [ brezhnev 's signing of the helsinki accords ] was to prove mortal . '' ( p. 503 ) . the argument here seems to be that by having agreed to the helsinki accords ( which included some boilerplate language on human rights ) , the communist leaders were thereafter hamstrung in suppressing those dissidents who dressed their opposition in terms of human rights rather than as political attacks against the party . he thus attributes the collapse of communism to the role of dissenters within the non-soviet eastern block countries . judt seems not to have grasped that these countries were just the playing field , not the actual players . he refers to himself as having been in czechoslovakia at this time ; perhaps this is why he seems to think that the minor protest groups within the soviet satellites were something other than marginal -- as causal agents rather than benefactors of larger forces . in this book , vaclav havel plays a far greater role than ronald reagan in the collapse of communism . in fact the name `` reagan '' itself only appears a dozen or so times -- in other words , it is rarely cited , and then usually in the off-hand manner with which those who wish they had influence dismiss those who do . ( reagan 's speech at the berlin wall is not even mentioned , something hard to fathom in an 800-page history of postwar europe . ) eventually , the anti-american streak which runs through this book from the beginning emerges into plain sight : `` but it should not be concluded ... that it was american encouragement or support which precipitated or facilitated their [ eastern europe 's ] liberation . '' ( p. 631 ) and then later , equally bluntly , `` ... [ despite ] the self-congratulatory narrative that has entered the american public record , washington did not `bring down ' communism , communism imploded of its own accord . '' ( p . 659 . ) really ? who would have thought that forty years of american effort in the cold war was just a waste of time ? this proposition is such obvious nonsense that it really does not need to be argued against , but the wonder is that someone who appears to understand the function of economics in history can fail to appreciate the central role of america , and specifically of the american taxpayer , in postwar europe . america paid for europe 's reconstruction ( marshall plan ) . america paid for europe 's welfare states ( by relieving their governments of the need to pay for their own defense , and also in the form of endless credits and loans ) . america paid for europe 's economic prosperity ( by bankrolling the agencies which funded it -- such as the imf & world bank -- and by opening american markets to european goods while allowing european markets to remain subsidized and protected ; something that is still the case today , from agriculture to airbus ) . and finally , it was america who paid for the soviet 's defeat . without america , modern europe would not exist . yes , it is undeniable that communism rotted from the inside . but rot by itself does not cause collapse ( otherwise how to explain north korea , a long-bankrupt thugocracy that survived even the death of the former thug-in-chief ? ) such states continue to exist indefinitely , until given a push . and so to answer judt 's own question : the reason communism collapsed when it did was because america pushed . ronald reagan reversed american policy and stood up to the soviets , and did so at a time when the major western european states were cowering in postures of supplication and appeasement ( thatcher 's uk excepted ) . it had nothing to do with the helsinki accords . judt flatters himself in the preface that his book will be controversial , but to this reader his conclusions are too silly to be worthy of controversy . they are simply wrong . it is a pity judt fails here . the fundamental lesson to be drawn from the history of postwar europe is that it is no good trying to make friends with the schoolyard bully -- or to give him your lunch money in order not to get beaten up ( the european response ) . the lesson is that you must stand up to bullies . appeasement in all its guises -- rapprochement , ostpolitik , engagement , detente , nixon/kissinger-style scheming , or carter 's endless vacillation -- inevitably leads to failure . and when the bill finally comes due , as it always does , then the accrued interest can be enormously costly in human life . this was true in munich in 1938 , and it remains true today . given the current state of the world , we could have used a book which reminded us of this basic truth right now . there are numerous errors and omissions , mostly minor ( iceland is missing from the cover maps ) , occasionally more significant ( for example , there is no understanding that the repeated attacks by american hedge funds against the weak european currencies did much more than just blow england and italy out of the erm in 1992 . they also forced a hugely embarrassing french devaluation in 1993 -- in the form of widened intervention bands -- and imposed a hitherto unknown market rigor upon the respective governments , basically requiring them to depoliticize monetary policy and rein in fiscal policy -- major changes in how these governments governed . the attacks also contributed to the ready adoption of the euro , as a collective defense against george soros . ) but any book of this scope will contain errors and omissions ; in fact the strength of postwar is its vast collection of facts and figures and statistics ( although weakened by the lack of source citations . ) it is in the small-scale work of collecting data that judt succeeds . it is in the big-scale work of interpreting those data that he fails . for example , toward the end of the book there is an account of the disaster in the balkans following the break up of yugoslavia . judt correctly identifies the nadir of postwar europe : the slaughter at srebrenica , in which 7400 muslims were murdered under the noses of dutch soldiers serving under un command . he then goes on to contrast the situation when nato took over , at which point the slaughters promptly stopped , and ten years of peace ensued ( enduring to this day ) . surely this is something to which you would ask : why ? the answer is simple : the un force , as is usual with un forces , was too small , had a weak and compromised mandate , was composed of soldiers who were inadequately equipped and commanded , and who operated under unrealistic rules of engagement . but the nato force tolerated no nonsense , they came in with the intention of standing up to the serbs , and had the roe to do it . the serb `army ' ( if thugs who slaughter civilians can be dignified with such a term ) promptly collapsed . same lesson : bullies must be stood up to . perhaps it is the fact that the force was american-led which prevented judt from seeing this . ( at the time of writing , the un is once again dithering in the same old way on the same old issue -- this time in lebanon and darfur -- a perfect example of why we should learn from the past instead of repeating it , as seems all but inevitable right now . what a sorry institution the un has become ! ) judt gives some good detail of postwar political theory on the continent -- something usually missing from english-language accounts , other than the obvious observation that such theory was mainly marxist . sartre and camus were predictable , foucault less so ( a substantial presence in france , but more or less unknown in america ) . judt appears to come from the political left himself , but nevertheless he seems not to have understood the basis of foucault ( which can be summed up , deep throat-like , as `` follow the power . '' ) in foucaultian terms , the discourse of dissent ( which judt claims collapsed communism ) was something entirely dictated by the power relations existing at the time . he would have said look not at the surface , look at the constellations ( a favorite foucaultian term ) of power . any objective survey of the constellations of power existing in europe in 1989 would center on the united states ( and might still do so today , despite a united germany , an expanded eu , and the absence of the soviet threat . ) in explaining the collapse of communism , historical roads as diverse as euro-marxism , macroï¿½-economics , empirical rationalism or even great man theory all lead to the same place : america . but according to judt , washington had nothing to do with it . by the final chapters , any pretense of objectivity has been lost . 9/11 was not a watershed horror for the free world , but a passing american event that by implication the us deserved for its middle eastern policy . ( of all european leaders since 1945 , judt reserves his strongest denunciation not for stalin or tito or ceausescu , but for tony blair . why ? blair supports american policy -- '' blindly , '' of course . ) in summing up what ( judt thinks ) binds europeans together , it is `` ... contrast with `the american ' way of life . ' ( p. 748 ) lastly , not just the content but the style is likely to be tiresome to american readers . there is an overabundance of smug english circumlocutions and double-negatives : `` it was not for nothing , '' `` not perhaps terribly , '' and the like . meaningless modifiers , such as `` more than a little '' and `` decidedly , '' are used ad nauseum , so that the text sometimes reads like a student essay in which the author has tried padding it out to make the required number or words . judt could learn from the great english historians of the past , of whom there are plenty , from gibbon to churchill . there is in postwar none of their directness of language , that firm relentless empiricism which at its best ascends into epic prose , noble in conception and majestic in scope . it is what makes reading them such a pleasure , whatever they have to say . reading judt is just a chore . in the end this book , for all its size , is just a sour little pamphlet -- an insult to the achievement that it purports to explain . it is the written equivalent of those old photographs of soviet leaders gathered atop lenin 's tomb on may day , in which the images of the purged party members have been carefully airbrushed out -- except that in postwar , it is not just a party hack but the main player who is missing . postwar is not even bad history , it is non-history , just anti-american propaganda dressed up as scholarship . it should sell well in france .
