waste of time this book was an incredible waste of time . i felt that the essays were a ) far too dated ( a rambling discourse on the dangers of cookies ) or b ) too out of touch ( rape in cyberspace was not a real rape in cyberspace , folks ) the authors seem to be mainly scholars without a tech background than technical folks and i have to agree that the thesaurus was in heavy use during the writing of most of the these essays . finally the book contains very little practical information on cyberethics . not even a single case study
