where are the first 8 stories ? i bought a dog-eared copy of this collection ( & quot ; trouble is my business & quot ; ) at a book sale for $ 1.50 a year ago . the copy i have is thick with 12 stories . i bought this copy of & quot ; trouble is my business & quot ; to have a better copy , but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four marlowe stories . my question is , what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four ? that 's not jake , fellas
