umm..did i read the same book as everyone else ? what on earth did everyone else read ? ! ? ... .this book is n't even worth 0.1 of a star . it 's terrible ! i 'm pretty sure 20c mass produced romance novels are better than this drivel . i 'm not really a fan of historical fiction , but it was given to me as a present so i felt i had to read it . the 'plot ' is terrible . none of the characters have any depth or any real storyline . our protagonist , if you can call him that ; nicolas , only has one trick up his sleeve to `` plough '' his girls ... a tale about how a unicorn 's horn makes everything pure . he then sets about trying to sleep with basically any girl over 12 . there 's a bit of talk here and there about tapestries ... but i think a primary school course in art history can give you more meaningful information than this book . the story is complete nonsense and very poorly expressed and to be honest with you , i can not believe it ever got published , let alone sold and read .
