i disliked this book so much i returned it ! as a lover and avid collector of books , i had high hopes for this book -- at first glance it seemed entrancing , especially the topic . unfortunately , once i started reading it more carefully , my spirits sank . some of the pictures are visually interesting , but most are not . even more disappointing , there is not much substantive information either . if you like the idea of this book and are looking for a more satisfying read , check out at home with books : how booklovers live with and care for their libraries by estelle ellis ( editor ) , et al . that book is worth every penny , and you 'll enjoy it
