this is the worst and most offensive book i have read i have cherokee lineage and decided to learn our history , which was not passed down in our family , so i got this book to read in good faith . the author makes us sound like a bunch of backward , bloodthirsty , superstitious people , and our women to be a bunch of promiscuous ( ... ) . there is little in the book of the trail of tears , and much of what is written prior to it gets off into flights of fancy and imagination of the author , who believes he can mind read for people dead over 150 years . when he does get around to the actual trail of tears ( the last sixth of the book ) he briefly accounts what facts or accounts there were , and gets into how not that many people really died , and the federal government is being portrayed in a bad light historically . he also portrays the cherokee nation 's history as rising and falling with the beginning and ending of his book , treating the cherokee as a quaint , dead culture and people . it saddens me that college students are being given this to read . i learned nothing about my culture and our history from this book
