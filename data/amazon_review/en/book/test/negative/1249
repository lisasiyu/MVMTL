boring this book is plainly boring in every way . the plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting . the first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars , and the second half deserved roughly one star . if you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart , then i suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting , like `` barney goes to the zoo '' . do not , and i repeat : do not read this book . if you would like to take interest in this novel , save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend . you will be disappointed
