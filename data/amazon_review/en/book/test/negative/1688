read it as a child - horrible morals i got this book from my grandma when i was 6 . i 'm 20 now and realize what an awful story this is ! this little rabbit gets a special gift of red cardinal 's wings , which seemed awesome to me as a kid , and his own mother and family reject him because he 's wierd ! a great book for homophobic parents or anyone else who wants their kid to know that being different is bad and if you are different , even your own parents will turn you away . i 'm just glad i read more shel silverstein poems than i did trash like this
