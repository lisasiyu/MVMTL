much ado about nothing as an introduction zen , what has been presented in this book is fine though it could have been done with lot less elitist overtone . i agree zen and its true comprehension does not come easy ( i am talking of regular mortals such as myself here ) and words as mere symbols for concepts are distorting when conveying zen . i do not propose that i am an expert on zen or even buddhism in general but i have read a few books on buddhism by thich nhat hanh , dalai lama , chogyam trungpa and others . though an agnostic who does not care for much for organized religion , i do believe the most fundamental benefit of any spiritual/ religious framework is to instill a sense of compassion toward other beings . you need some kind of cultural creation ( religious or otherwise ) to counter act the natural tendency of a human to be self-serving . in this aspect , i have high regards for non-theistic buddhism and the inclusiveness of vedanta ( hinduism ) that proposes all religions eventually lead to the same attainment . from this viewpoint i was surprised with this author . this author may have been one of the leading authorities on zen in his time , but unfortunately he comes as an arrogant , elitist , full of prejudices . he does not miss any opportunity to put down other religions or even other sects of buddhism . only zen as practiced by the rinzai sect is pure , strong and generally worthy of pursuit . any form of spiritualism from the west is of course hopeless since the western mind can not escape the conditioning of logical thinking . any spiritualism from india is complex , ceremonial and not practical . other sects of buddhism generally do not have true comprehension , lost their way focusing on non-essentials etc . he reserves his most disparaging remarks for indian religions and monks ( and does his best to show that though buddhism originated in india , it is really the chinese and japanese due to their practical nature made something of it ) . is this just the standard fundamentalism/ misplaced racism ? i will definitely read other books on zen and go beyond this author .
