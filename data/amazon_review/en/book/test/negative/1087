waiting ... point taken waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages . ha jin 's personal accomplishments notwithstanding , this is one of the most overrated books i have read . national book award ? hmmm . waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution , lin , trapped in a loveless marriage . when lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital -- manna wu -- herself the victim of waiting for a man , he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands . everyone in waiting waits ... and waits ... and waits . the book gets its point across , and more or less works as an allegory on the chinese communist state . it lacks any deeply interesting characterization , as manna , and even lin , are both all too childlike ( as the author intends ) . the book also lacks lyricism and elegance , and unforgivable trangression for sucha decorated piece of literature . ha jin 's story educates , but does n't elevate us
