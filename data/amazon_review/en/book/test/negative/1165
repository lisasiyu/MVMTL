not so good first off , i 'll admit that i did n't read the whole book . now i 'll say my peace on it . hacker generalizes broadly about the behaviors and sentiments of both whites and blacks . though white himself , he seems to absolutely despise whites across the board as either racist scum or well-meaning but idiotic . then he says that martin luther king jr. only came to prominence as a leader of the civil rights movement because the whites in power chose him . it sounds to me as if hacker thinks that the black population were too ignorant to choose there own leader and allowed the whites to give them their hand-picked mlk jr . the thought of that makes me ill . apparently , in hacker 's world view , everyone except himself is either evil or stupid . but it was very entertaining
