would have made a better blog than book ... the premise here is so engaging that i 'm not surprised the author got it published , but basically , it 's such a self-indulgent ramble that it 's not worth the time of people other than the author . how can a person make the topic of james bond and his 'disturbing world ' feel so draggy that it takes real commitment to keep reading through the first 100 pages ? if you 'd like to know , read the first hundred pages of this book . like many , i came to this book expecting very little except that it be consistently interesting and fun to read . we 're talking about james bond here after all . the author repeatedly reminds us not to take his pontifications overly seriously , and that 's fine , but in that case , we should n't have to be bored . i would strongly recommend not reading this book . it could have been covered in a long magazine article or , as i said , as the occasional comment on a blog about james bond
