um , the 50 's are over ... robert putnam 's book bemoans the declne in `` civic participation '' among americans since its heyday in the 50 's and 60 's . although few would argue that bridge clubs are n't what they used to be , who would have predicted the rise of 20,000 member mega-churches back in 1962 ? this underlines the basic problem with this book : it focuses too much on what constituted `` communities '' and `` activities '' in the past , without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today . while i agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index , and participation in traditional formal organizations has declined , i would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the 21st century has risen . for example , while young people famously are less likely to vote in our dual-party system , college students today volunteer more that any generation before them . in addition , while participation in mainline protestant churches has stedily declined , engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically . while i personally feel that the sterile suburban , drive-everywhere-in-my-suv existance is soul crushing , and the popularity of reality tv may be a sign of the apocolypse , i also do n't pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week , while dad worked 9-5 , returned home to supper , and went to the men 's club on tuesdays at 8 . and while putnam 's basic premise may resonate with many , its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument
