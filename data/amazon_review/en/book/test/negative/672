good story / bad characters the story is great , and even educational . asimov 's science and visual settings are excellent and , well , fantastic . but the characters were painfully cliche . perhaps they were n't when the book was written , but they certainly are now . you have your main character : a tall , strong , and dashingly handsome take-charge guy of infinite courage . and your sidekick ( pretty much ) : a beautiful , young , intelligent woman who wants only to be respected for her intellect and not her perfect body and flowing hair . the dialogue between these characters is ludicrous at best , and takes up a depressingly large amount of the novel . y'know - him constantly hitting on her in a rather pushy way , and her constantly deflecting his come-ons with a secret physical attraction for him . and yes , his heroic strength saves her more than once . and , of course , they get together in the end . i respect asimov tremendously , but this book was like lucas ' episode iii : a great story with a horrendous script and characters . and also like episode iii , i finished it trying to convince myself that i liked it , but was pretty much just annoyed that i gave it the time that i did
