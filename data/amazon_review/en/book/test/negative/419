warning : this novel may be dangerous to diabetics i sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years , and i want my week back . it only took that long because i had to push myself to finish it . spoilers ahead : meggie and father ralph ( who everyone always seems to refer to as ralph de bricassart , even when they 're talking to him ) meet when he is twenty-six and meggie is ... ten . she speaks , acts and thinks like a 5-year-old , though . as the years go by , father ralph de bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little meggie , and she develops a girlish crush on him . as meggie is also `` developing a very feminine figure , '' ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be . they discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand `` do n't love me , my darling , for i love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be '' conversations throughout the book . finally , after years of smothering their passion , they do it . in a really very boring scene that 's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions . and would n't ya know it , she gets pregnant . ralph de bricassart realizes ( again ) that their love can never be , and leaves . meggie has his baby , and capers about gleefully that she 's `` stolen '' something back from god . but would n't ya know it , the kid ( who 's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy i 've ever encountered in literature ) decides to be a priest . so she sends him to father ralph de bricassart for training , who -- get this -- is so totally brain dead that it never once occurs to him that this might be his child ! ! ! ! ! ! ! apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood ; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from meggie , when even the other priests figure it out . the big secret finally does come out ( again in a very brief , anticlimactic scene ) toward the end , but by then we 're too busy skimming to really care . all this leaves out a great many things -- including immortal dialogue that makes meggie sound perpetually ten years old ( `` i 'll tell you something else about your roses , ralph de bricassart -- they 've got nasty , hooky thorns ! `` ) , endless , heavyhanded symbolism ( ashes of roses , thorn birds ... we get it ! we get it ! ) , some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90 % of the book , and one of the most unintentionally hilarious `` tragic '' scenes i 've ever read ( death by pig ) . yet the ralph-and-meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on . and we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together . i was expecting other subplots and development of other characters , and this never really happened . many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing : meggie 's cruel judgment of her daughter justine as a `` monster '' and a `` b* tch , '' for example , seemed to have no basis . the last third or so involves meggie making peace with her mother and daughter , and it just does n't matter . the quick `` the end '' wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if i 'd still cared by that point . even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless , and thoroughly unlikable . scarlett o'hara was selfish , but she was fun ; these people are selfish and boring . sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash .
