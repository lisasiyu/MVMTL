i dropped it after 21 pages this book from what other reviewers said really does n't add much new info in terms of the much-publicized deaths of tupac , biggie or jam master jay ... which is one of the big motivations i 'm sure most of us consider reading a book like this . also the fact that this book was written by a cop from the once secret `` hip hop police '' is also somewhat novel . you 'll spend most of the first 20 pages sifting through this guy trying to straddle the fence -- sounding official & professional to rep police but also trying to come off as empathetic and altruistic in his quest to `` save '' hip hop 's elite from crime & corruption . read this book with a grain of salt ! ! ! ! i dropped it after page 21 ( go to a bookstore or library and read the bottom 2.5 paragraphs ) . parker 's basic premise in his defense of policing hip hop is not that he sees the stars as needing protection ( which is why soooo many rappers still roll deep , packin ' heat ! ) , but rather that so many are still so heavily involved in criminal activity he 's doing what he does for public safety . give me a break . who 's really afraid of ludacris ? jay-z ? kanye west ? chamillionaire ( or 50 cent for that matter ) ? parker dares to use the term `` public safety '' in this defense and discusses how any number of acts of gunplay could `` breakout at any time '' when rappers are in public . let 's see , we 've got ... a raging war in iraq & the threat of nuclear terrorism . ongoing police brutality issues . trickle down damage from crooked politicians . real crime . all kinds of sexual predators . increasingly fragile school systems not to mention poverty , intolerance & all kinds of social ills . yeah , parker 's doing a great job defending society from public enemy no . 1 : poor black men who use hip hop success to rise to a better life . skim the book 's latter chapters for the minor details you seek if you 'd like , but i pass on reading more of this crap . i 'm sure he 's got interesting stories to tell , but this book just reads like an opportunist looking to make a fast buck by preying on the weak-minded blind enough to believe rappers ( code for young black men ) must be tamed
