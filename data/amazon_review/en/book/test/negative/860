need more detail i bought this book thinking it would be a more specicfic musculoskeletal companion to braddom 's generalized pm & r textbook . unfortunately the treatment paragraphs ( most important section from my perspective ) for each topic were very thin and nonspecific . they were woefully inadequate for an attending or physiatry resident . i sent the book back which unfortunately meant i did n't get to critique the dvd .
