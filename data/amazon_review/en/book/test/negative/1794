rambling and overbearing this book was arcane and verbose which made it very difficult and unenlightening . the author digresses often and seems to add-in superfluous commentary on unrelated subjects . his references often point to `` current events '' which have long since lost relevance and the entire text has a dated , maze-like feeling . if you 're looking for an account of the life of st. francis of assisi , i would not recommend this book . if you are familiar with the life of st. francis and are looking for a commentary on the events of his life you may find this work helpful due to its supposed eminence among works about the saint
