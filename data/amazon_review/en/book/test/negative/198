they killed trees for this ? what a disastrously bad and unfunny novel . the self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny , the `` plot '' is see-through and cliched , and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog . when people criticize chick lit , this is exactly the kind of book they 're talking about . it 's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously , or stretches for a literary flourish , it 's absolutely cringe-worthy . i find it hard to believe the people who 've praised it here actually read the same book . this was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement . she said she did n't really like it but thought it would be `` more my kind of thing . '' obviously not a person who knows me well . thankfully , it does n't appear the author is terribly prolific , so readers do n't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing . i would n't say it 's one of the worst books i 've read , but it 's certainly one of the most useless
