absolutely hilarious this author claims to use logic and skepticism , all i can see from his book is a lack there of . this book along with lyne 's other book is the only propaganda , not some some massive cia front . i was once a believer but no longer , ufology and all that tesla nonesense is just that , nonesense . if you want to learn about physics read anything by the genious of einstein , not by this quack . if you do n't want to waste your time i suggest getting any book by philip klass instead of this book
