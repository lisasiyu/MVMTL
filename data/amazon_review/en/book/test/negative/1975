ruined my day i 'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing the horse whisperer a couple of hours ago . i 'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else . not only are marriages broken , but trust between parent and child . i 'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character `` can not control , '' `` just feels right , '' etc . and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best . i am saddened that these people do not understand what love is , or for that matter what marriage and a family are . the pain and heartache , the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing . i 'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book . i think that all i need now is to hug my sweet , honest husband and dear children , who know that the greatest gift i can give them is to love their father . that is all . my vent is over . thank you .
