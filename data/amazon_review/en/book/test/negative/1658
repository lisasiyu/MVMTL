close to useless this book does not include plates of birds that are included in peterson field guides from western north america , eastern north america or texas . so , unless you have their guide books memorized for these locations , the mexico guide book is basically useless . alternatively , you could buy all four books ( eastern na , western na , texas , and mexico ) and carry them all with you . or you could just purchase a different , stand-alone guide book with plates of the most or all of the birds in the region .
