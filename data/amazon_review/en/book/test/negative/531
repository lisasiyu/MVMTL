hated it i love the scarpetta books , but i had to force myself to finish this one . the plot was disjointed , and the use of the english language was atrocious . i ca n't believe she published this . it is absolutely not up to par . if you 're going to waste your time on this book , get it from a library so you do n't waste your money as well
