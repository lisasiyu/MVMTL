natural vs unnatural i see that some people were helped by this book . i would not recommend this book for someone who has not experienced sex . the advice to virgins was disgusting . the writers say that the sexual act is not natural and that people need help enjoying it . the writer also suggests techniques of preparation for the virgin the month before that most assuredly would either lead to depending on yourself for fulfillment or it would train a young lady to not be responsive . i thought the book was sick . it turns women into an object of function . it also talks about men being 100 % head of the household and women being 100 % submissive . the authors are a husband and wife but i ca n't hear a woman 's voice anywhere in this book . the cover is pretty so she probably had something to do with that . i 'm sure she submitted completely to him in the writing of this book and that is why it is completely clinical and even crude
