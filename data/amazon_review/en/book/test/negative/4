suks comepletely this joke book suks . if i can give it any star i want , i would give it a -10 stars . i never actually bought it , but i borrowed it from a friend . i needed a joke book for my anouncements on the intercom every morning , and it only lasted 3 days and i ran out of good jokes . some of the jokes arnt appropriate and most of them dont make sense . if your gon na buy a joke book , dont buy this
