eye of the beholder musty , dated , old boy humor of the kind floating around breakrooms and water-coolers . this stuff was n't funny when the vaudeville hacks were doing it . i like mr.asimov , and probably would have been somewhat charmed by his delivery ( maybe ) . all in all , read benchley or woody allen again for literary laughs and leave asimov for the 3000 other genres he dabbled in
