what is positive ? innacurate arguments what exactly is positive about the koran and its view of women ? every single assertion of this polemic is either a complete fabrication or wrong . the hadiths and sunna are not the chauvinistic part 'corrupting ' the koran , if anything the opposite is true . in surah 4:34 the koran orders the husband to beat his wife . in numerous suras the husband is ordered to pay the equivalent of a dowry to his wife , not her family however . the entire koranic book of 'women ' is simply one law after another about 'them ' which is to say the women . the reason it is talking about 'them ' when referring to women and 'us ' when speaking about men is because the koran is meant for men . there is not one equality in the entire koran dealing with women and men . men may take four wives women , women presumably one husband . men may have slaves and men may marry and do as they please sexually with the slaves . no similar injunction applies for women . men receive virgins and wine and service in heaven ... the situation of women in heaven is left to the imagination , although presumably they make up the virgins . the koran details a world of only men where women are not only chattel but are the sexual objects of the society , sold as slaves and used and then divorced at the mans pleasure . there is not one equality . scholars have argued that koran reformed women 's rights and elevated their status because in pre-islamic arabia women had no rights and under koran they are entitled to at least a dowry and a man may not take endless numbers of wives . this does n't translate as equality , it translates as a male centered world , where men are masters and women are virtually property . the fact that god in koran is not referred to as 'father ' does not indicate a feminist view of god but merely reflects the very monotheistic nature of islam , certainly a valid fact that differentiates it from christianity . however once again this is not evidence of women 's rights , because the non-gender view of god does n't change the very negative view of women 's role on earth given in the koran . if someone is going to read this they should certainly have handy an unbiased translation of the koran so they can reflect on all the laws regarding women and why those same laws do not apply equally to men , for instance one might wonder why a wife may not beat her disobeying husband ? or why the husband is not commanded to be modest ? seth j. frantzman
