terrible simply disastrous work by pohl . after throroughly enjoying the original gateway , i was looking forward to this sequel . my hopes were utterly shattered . in summary , here is why this book was totally unreadable . 1 . the main characters , stan and estrella , are totally unbelievable . their dialogue is only slightly above kindergarten level . they are never given any motivation for their actions . 2 . pohl fills the pages with useless details , including information about plantlife , and cooking , as well as vomitting and bowel movements . i gave up on the book completely when he decided to indulge in an entire page about one man going to the toilet . maybe he was trying to be funny . it did n't work . 3 . total lack of plot development . the book is basically a loosely connected series of random events , stuffed with filler . mid-way through the book pohl begins to introduce entirely new characters in an attempt to generate some kind of plot momemntum . i have never read a more unfocussed science fiction novel . it comes off as really poorly done space-opera . 4 . characters are completely flat . stan and estrella are both sickeningly dumb . every other character is the exact same cardboard cutout . aliens act just like humans except they talk funny . it is very cheesy and lacks any attempt at originality . 5 . book has an insane number of sex scenes , and they are all badly written . i mean literally , you cannt go more than 15 pages without a sex scene . so juvenile . i would go on , but i believe my point is made . this book has not a single redeeming feature . if you enjoyed gateway , do not ruin your memory of it by reading this sequel .
