this book is bad this won a pulitzer for reasons i do n't understand . maybe it 's because i 'm not sophisticated enough , but after reading gunter grass i 'm starting to think literary awards are given out on the basis of how regular and detailed the physical descriptions of male genitalia and its veins are in the book . this is a leaving las vegas style story about a guy who decides to drink himself to death . the only problem is he 's lived his whole life and settled in to die by a quarter of the way through the book . this book gives you empathy with the main character not by putting you in his skin through skilled storytelling , but by boring you to the point you yourself know what it 's like to want to die . this book seems mainly to be loved by those who deem it a mark of sophistication to like things most people find offensive . sex , foul language , crude descriptions - they 're all fine as a means to an end but this books parades them for no literary purpose i can detect . this book has interesting elements , but it 's bad
