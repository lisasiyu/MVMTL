a big waste of time for the exam i would not even give this book one star if i had a choice ! although some people state that this book may be informative and easy reading , and one poster even stated that it helped him pass a different exam , it fails miserably in preparing you for the 70-291 exam . the book should have been titled `` some really really basic windows server infrastructure info and just barely scratching the surface of the 70-291 exam ! '' the book was short and easy reading and i aced all the questions at the end of each chapter . but when i took a real practice test by selftest software , i got 5 questions out of 50 correct on my first try . not a good start for the exam which i wanted to take next week . the questions on the practice test that i got wrong were not even covered in any respect in the book . i 've passed 70-290 and 70-270 and i can tell you that i know what to expect from a book and from the ms tests and this book does almost nothing for you in regards to the exam . sure , it may be nice reading and it may have some interesting info , but if you are planning on buying a book to prepare for the 70-291 exam , skip this one . i am going to reschedule my exam for a few weeks later and buy a real book !
