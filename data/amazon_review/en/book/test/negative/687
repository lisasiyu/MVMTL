unbiblical and bad writing make for one star this book is so flawed in every which way , it is hard to know where to begin . first of all , we are living in the end times , and when jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks . there 's no seven years , no christians being zapped up , etc . this is our second chance on earth . no tribulation . this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly . reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a christian . why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life . it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message . plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it . but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point ( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies ) . my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series ; then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter ( and much better writing ) . man , not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck
