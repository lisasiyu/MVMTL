5 stars ? really ? mark rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in america . most of his ideas are solid , but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word `` interesting '' to describe it . did they actually read it ? this book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different , yet equally boring ways . i honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever . this book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original , not to mention solid , ideas . the nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument . not only was the book dry , but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the us is a part of , and in particular , the role that immigration plays on poverty in the us . he talks about the us and the people in it as if they were static , but we live in a very fluid world , growing more fluid everyday , and i feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument .
