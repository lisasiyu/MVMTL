almost turned me off to heinlein i 've been a fan of heinlein 's sf for just about as long as i 've been an sf fan at all ( somewhere around thirty-five years ) . but when i read this collection some twenty-odd years ago , it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether . the fiction is pretty good ( although even that is n't heinlein 's best ) . but to describe the nonfiction accurately , i 'd have to use words that amazon will remove from the review anyway . for the most part , the pieces collected here represent a side of heinlein i strongly dislike . though i respect _starship troopers_ , it 's never going to be my favorite heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of `` fascism '' -- and i 'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection . and mind you , it 's not because i disagree with heinlein 's opinions ; it 's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed . some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic . ( at least in his fiction , he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short , to grok them . not here , boy . ) heinlein ( who bought into the korzybski/general semantics fad pretty early on ) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions . but his own attempt at philosophy , as represented here in e.g . `` the pragmatics of patriotism '' , is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy i 've ever seen . then , too , people who knew heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor , he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him . well , he 's certainly unpleasant here ; anybody who does n't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head . even in the unlikely event that i thought he were _right_ , i would n't find this a very helpful approach . perhaps more surprisingly , his popular writings on _science_ are n't very good . asimov 's reputation as the `` great explainer '' is in no danger here . this volume is second only to _grumbles from the grave_ in cementing heinlein 's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was . when i want heinleinian company , i 'll stick to d.b . davis , manuel garcia o'kelly davis , and ( maybe ) lazarus long . and when i want to read some humane nonfiction by an sf master , i 'll still turn to asimov . i credit heinlein with three magisterial novels , several imperfect-but-great ones , and a good number of brilliant short stories . but the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer
