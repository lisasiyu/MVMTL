`` wow '' ? i think not i read the reviews here before purchasing this book and was encouraged by some of them . in addition to this book , i purchased illustrator cs killer tips and adobe illustrator cs idea kit . now , not to the insult the author , but this book was horrifying . i felt like i was reading a boring , difficult college textbook ! i 'm not new to adobe or the interface , and i self-taught myself elements and photoshop . i must say that i was severely dissapointed by the lack of visual aid , visual detail , and failure to get me intrigued - how could i be with pages and pages of text to read with one or two pictures of angles or crappy artwork ? i have to find another illustrator book so i actually learn something ... what a dissapointment ! the cd was also relatively dissapointing - nothing was interactive and was not at all well-explained in the book or the content on cd . plus , some of the lessons were advertisements for steuer 's online classes . ha ! the only good thing was the art that it did have was in color , and color is good - which is why i gave it one more star than i would 've . if you buy it , do n't open the cd so you have the option of returning it
