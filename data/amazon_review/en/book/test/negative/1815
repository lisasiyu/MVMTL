this debut is the pits it 's summer , and parker county , texas , is gearing up for the annual peach festival . that includes retired teacher phyllis and her friend and boarder carolyn . both women always enter the cooking contest . carolyn usually wins , and phyllis is determined to beat her this year . while the two women are out picking peaches , the farm 's owner dies . his death could be ruled an accident , but it might also be murder . phyllis 's son , an officer with the sheriff 's department , investigates . unfortunately , he ca n't find any conclusive evidence one way or the other . the day of the peach festival brings another death . head judge donnie boatwright keels over just after trying phyllis 's spicy peach cobbler . this is a clear case of murder , however . the man was poisoned . when phyllis is quickly cleared of suspicion , the police turn their attention to carolyn . phyllis knows her friend could n't have done it . but can she prove it ? the book showed promise at the beginning . the first death took place in the first chapter . but then it quickly went downhill . once donnie dies , the book focuses all the attention there . still , very little seems to happen . the characters , carolyn especially , are n't really that likeable . and the writing style is fairly poor , with dangling modifiers and awkward sentences throughout the book . even the three recipes in the back of the book could have used a bit more detail . the book sounded promising , so i 'm very sorry i ca n't recommend it . i wo n't be visiting phyllis again
