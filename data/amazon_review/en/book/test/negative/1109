it must be a guy thing i found the plot of this book impossible to follow . it contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches . the hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason . and there are only so many times i can read variations of `` he swung his sword really hard '' and `` it was a really scary dragon . '' the illustrations are quite beatiful , though
