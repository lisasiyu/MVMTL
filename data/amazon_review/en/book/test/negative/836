controversial but naive robert a. heinleins novel `` starship troopers '' still creates controversy , generations after it was first published . indeed , the well-known movie `` starship troopers '' was actually a veiled criticism of the book ! is heinlein 's book racist or fascist ? is it a cold war allegory ? is it anti-democratic and militarist ? how does this novel square with heinlein 's reputation for being a libertarian and near-hippie ? these questions are still being hotly debated . `` starship troopers '' describe a future society in which only people who have served in the military enjoy full citizenship rights . only honorably discharged soldiers have the right to vote and run for office . strangely enough , the non-citizens enjoy freedom of speech , freedom of worship and the right to start businesses . heinlein 's future society thus looks like modern america , but with a marine corps-like military caste superimposed on top . in the novel , humanity wages a never-ending war against several races of intelligent space aliens , including the collectivist arachnids , who resemble spiders . many people take the arachnids to be a symbol for communism in general or red china in particular . imperial japan is another possibility . heinlein 's novel attempts to solve that ancient question : how can a society make sure that the best people serve in office ? this question is particularly acute in democracies , where anyone can stand for office , and everyone can vote . heinlein 's solution is to limit the franchise to those who have served in the military . in this way , only the best are selected for the job . and those willing to put their lives on the line must be the best . but does that really solve the problem ? a military is not necessarily a good administrator or politician . the best in times of peace might be different from the best in times of war . heinlein 's system only works if a total and never-ending war is raging . indeed , the war against the arachnids certainly seem to be such . but if so , it 's naive to expect freedom of speech or extensive rights for non-citizens . the system would become a military dictatorship pure and simple , like in the movie `` starship troopers '' . the soldiers in the novel are probably inspired by the philosopher-kings and guardians of plato 's `` republic '' . after rigorous military training , the officers are given courses in moral philosophy , history and politics . but there are also similiarities with ancient athenian democracy . every citizen of ancient athens was expected to serve in the army or navy . there was a connection between rights and duties . but note that many non-citizens in athens were slaves ! ultimately , `` starship troopers '' is unconvincing , even naive . you simply can not give political power to the military , no matter how the military is recruited , and expect everything else to stay the same .
