the worst edition possible the new page edition of this book is a true piece of cr*p ! every single page has multiple typographical errors , obviously deriving from shoddy proofreading of the text they scanned . i thought i could deal with it , but it reached the point where it was distracting , so i ordered the dover edition instead . i was an idiot not to get that one in the first place . do n't repeat my mistake
