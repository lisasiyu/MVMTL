if only campbell were the author ... there 's not much to say . the book is n't confusing because the material is too technical -- it 's often confusing because the author does n't go in enough depth ; it 's frustrating when a crucial concept is presented , such as hamilton 's law , but no examples on its applications are put forth . i find myself frequently searching the internet to suppliment this textbook . it also does n't help that the book does n't come with a cd-rom , or any additional material , unless you purchase the teacher 's edition ... reading this textbook makes me yearn for campbell .
