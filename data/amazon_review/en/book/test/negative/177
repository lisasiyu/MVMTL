boring , boring , boring blech . i hated this book . i read a lot of `` high drama '' books about teen issues as i work with teens who find themselves in this genre . unlike speak , or crank , or even cut , smack is a book that does n't connect with anyone . oh , and did i mention that it is boring ? do n't be misled by the other reviews , this insipid ride to unbelievable town does n't belong on your bookshelf
