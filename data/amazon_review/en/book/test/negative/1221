tedious my main interest in reading the book was for the information about the nazi fascination with the occult . i was hoping for something as stimulating as mel gordon 's hanussen : hitler 's jewish clairvoyant . i was greatly disappointed . christopher hale 's himmler 's crusade does n't really deliver what it promises . hale basically pooh-poohs anything connected with the occult , asserts that only himmler took such notions seriously ( but was indulged by those seeking favors from him ) and then moves on to other matters . the book draws no real conclusion other than `` nazis were evil , '' which it pounds repeatedly throughout the book . ( i think i knew that before i even started reading the book . ) hale never seems to be sure of exactly which story he is telling . for a while it seems as though the book is about schaeffer , who led the expedition , then toward the end , it drops him altogether and starts giving detailed biographical information about other members of the expedition ( and the people with whom they interacted ) . the author goes off on lots of tangents , giving unessential details about minor figures and events that had little bearing on the main story . after having invested several weeks in reading the book , i am not sure what the point of it was . the most interesting parts of the book were those that took place in tibet , but the trip to tibet actually takes up only about half the book . the rest is a long-winded recounting of the rise and fall of nazism . it seems to me that here we have yet another book written by someone completely lacking a literary sensibility . the author , christopher hale , is a british tv documentarist . this book is an appendix to his tv show . i found it very difficult reading . in addition to its lack of focus , i just do n't think hale is very comfortable with the printed word . there are pages and pages wherein it seems he is giving verbal descriptions of documentary film footage . perhaps his tv show was interesting , but the book was a chore to read . in addition , the author has this maddening habit of inserting inflammatory opinions into his narrative , apropos of nothing and lacking supporting evidence . several times throughout the book , the author , a briton , makes outlandish parallels between america and nazi germany , which he does n't bother to back up ( because he ca n't ) . perhaps one can get away with this in a tv documentary , but not in a book , where the reader can back up and say , `` wait a minute . that 's a bunch of crap . where is the evidence are you basing that statement on ? '' the book is also rife with typographical errors ( some of them giving an unintentional double entendre when for example `` role '' is spelled `` roll '' ) and misusages of words . it appears to have not been edited at all . i give this book one and a half stars , but let 's round it off to two just for the research the author has done . ( his bibliography is probably of a lot more use than the book . ) i just wish he had been able to put all this research into a more coherent form and told it in a way that was more comprehensible and more interesting
