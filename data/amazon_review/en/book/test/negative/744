evocative but disjointed frances mayes , author of under the tuscan sun , did not set out to write a typical travel book with a year in the world . she wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next , and instead aimed to discover , `` could i feel at home here ? what is home to those around me ? '' renting ( mostly luxurious ) homes in such places as fez , turkey , italy , greece , portugal and britain , mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations . while this premise sounds interesting enough , mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience . her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches , yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired i want to pick them up and carry them . and all throughout , she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes , and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail . the result seems disjointed and too clever , and renders the book very difficult to read . a year in the world does have some fine moments , such as mayes ' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations . but mostly i found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or i found myself wanting less , as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous . the impression i ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home ' in the countries mayes and her husband visited , but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food , gardens , and literature
