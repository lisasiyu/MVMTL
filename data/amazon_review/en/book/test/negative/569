boycott robert g . allen ! ! ! robert g. allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer . if you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like i did , he will send you several junk emails a day . unsubscribing does n't work , and trying to block the sender 's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time . the funny part is that the emails are n't even coded properly . they always show up as just a bunch of html code . would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who ca n't even code html properly ? anyway , his spamming practices are completely illegal and it 's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him . but that should n't come as any surprise considering that mister allen has been in trouble with the law before . he 's had several run-ins with the irs , lawsuits against him , and a chapter 7 bankruptcy . i would also stay away from his nothing down real estate methods . many of those practices are illegal , and the president of the nothing down club in atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it . for more info on allen , visit johntreed dottcomm , click on real estate investing , then click real estate guru ratings . bottom line , do n't trust this guy and do n't buy his books . and if you 're reading this mr. allen , take me off your @ % # & * $ mailing list ! !
