poor concept/outdated info this book mostly skims over our history with not much information other than dates , instead referring you to all kinds of internet websites for the meat . unfortunately , many of the websites no longer exist ( although i bought the book almost as soon as it was released ) , or they just can not be accessed with the addresses given , so the book is essentially useless . given the life-expectancy of a lot of websites , it hardly seems like a wise concept by barrons for an entire series of books .
