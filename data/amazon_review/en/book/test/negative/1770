pure egotistical , twisted accounts of the truth . this book is exactly that . i know mr. morehouse and one of the people he writes about in this book ... my father , mel riley . all i can say is , you should read paul smith 's accounts if you want the truth pertaining to the stargate and rv stories . there is also a documentary , if you can find it , made be discovery bbc called `` the real x-files '' featuring a true and honest view of rv and it 's history with the military and all those involved . giving this book much more than 1 star is really admitting lack of intelligence .
