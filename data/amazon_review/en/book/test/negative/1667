i hated it i just did n't like this book . i wanted to put it down and not pick it up ever again , but once i start reading a book i have to finsh it . first she was trying to run away from her past , then i dont know why her husband stayed with her . she made me sick and i liked her sister more than her . i was kind of hoping that her husband would have left her for her sister instead of staying with her . eric jerome dickey has been slipping in his last few books i hope the next two coming out this year will be better . ashley
