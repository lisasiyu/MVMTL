interesting story , difficult to read , see the movie ? i almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation . i was determined to try though . once i got used to the almost non-existent editing i was able to enjoy the story . it is a challenge , but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life . i 'm not sure the effort was worth it , though . note to writers -- employ editors so that your story is n't lost due to hard to read prose ! it added nothing to the book to create a new `` style '' and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating . this is one of the few times that i wish i had just watched the movie instead
