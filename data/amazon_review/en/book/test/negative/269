pathetic i 'm not surprised that many of the reviewers here gave the books such high marks . their reviews , much like the book , are littered with misspellings and other inaccuracies . perhaps we can blame this on the evil conservative right-wing establishment known as our education system ... .oh , wait ... .it 's largely liberal ? holy cow . oh , sorry , a religious reference . shame on me
