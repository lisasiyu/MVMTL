great stuff , low value overall the book ( if you can call it that ) does offer what its supposed to and does that in an effective manner . it teaches you how to develop persuasion . the trouble though is it only gives you the most basic outline on just 11 pages . the information that is contained inside of it is something that has been available for years in other similiar books
