where 's the story ... ? the theme is interesting enough - an american inmate of a british lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of oed . unfortunately the book does n't have much beyond the outline of the theme . as some other reviewers have noted , it would have made a decent magazine article , but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition , semi relevant trivia , and melodramatic hyperbole of the `` superior '' victorian english kind
