when is a circle not a circle ? john calvin blazed the trail for most reformed reviewers : if you disagree with what is said , kill the 'sayer ' . ad hominem critique , attempting to discredit an idea by crushing its advocate , is particularly odious in theological discussion but many of the chapters is this book raise it to an art form . the argument of this book : the classical description of god = the biblical description of god : take our word for it , we are the experts , no discussion needed . anyone who disagrees with us is obviously inspired by satan to destroy christianity . god loves only people who think like us - to hell ( literally ) with the others . classical theology presents a picture of god as a disconnected ( in his ultimate nature ) , unfeeling , micro manager who chooses to allow evil when he could stop it . as a recovering calvinist who finally read the scriptures and took them seriously ( how 's that for a back door ad hominem ? i 've still got it ) it appears god has revealed himself in the bible as something diferent : a loving , involved creator/father who is working with his children to restore a fallen world . if you are looking for argument by stipulation , beyond the bounds is for you . if you want careful analysis of germane scripture passages , look elsewhere
