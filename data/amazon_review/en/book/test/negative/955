the proponents of postmodernism are excrutiatingly overrated i have great respect for charles jencks as an architect , and as a critic of art relating to such . therefore the book should be retitled , what is postmodern architecture ? or what is everything about post-modernism except the art ? the main focus seems to be on the industrial world which created the art , rather then the art . seems hardly revolutionary or even relevant since everyone and their brother and sister has written on that subject since 1820 . i was hoping for something which would address the art , but i was sorely disappointed . the constant focus on the world around the buildings of postmodernism dragged and was inebriatingly dull ( it got to the point where the author was forced to contradict himself to make the book interesting ) . the focus of postmoderism was once architecture , however , now the focus has shifted , it seems everyone except the academics know this . not only was his sections on art and literature stupid , but incorrect , and blunderingly light . i expected more from jencks , being the great mind of the century he was . if you want to know anything helpful and relevant pretaining to post modernism today , do not read this book . but hey if you want to know about your father 's post modernism , read this book
