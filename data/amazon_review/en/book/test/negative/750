tedious as a software developer i found most of the information in this book to be something less than earth shattering . basically , there are companies that specialize in data mining as much information on us as they can . the present administration is drooling over the possibility to use this information . a large percentage of the information stored in the databases is in error . that 's pretty much the book . should we be concerned ? yes , but not of the information existing because its mostly public information anyway that is being linked in creativie ways . i 'm not an advocate for this by any means but i 'm not terribly fearful of it either . what does concern me , and should you , is how much of the information is wrong and how difficult it is to get these companies to fix it . to me , that was the greatest point the book made . as for government spying . we know now that the government is surveying us in much greater and more orwellian ways than we would have thought possible . unfortunately , this is what i wanted to learn more about and is pretty much missing from the book . also , there is no `` solution '' provided . how can we protect ourselves ? mainly , i was disapointed be because every person mentioned in the book has a drawn out biography provided about them . i really did n't care how the ceo of a data mining company grew up . i wanted to learn about the subject of the book , not history of indivuals . its not a bad book , but i grew tired of the biographies and the content did n't surprise me or frighten me enough to be real impressed
