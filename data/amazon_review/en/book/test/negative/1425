he talks a lot but doesnt say much i bought this hoping for wise advice on financial matters . i instead found this book to be 200 pages of talk without substance . the points it makes ( dont retire , quit work , die broke ) are remade over and over in different ways without much of any intelligent argument as to why or how . i felt the book was not worth a read at all and was just a bunch of fluff to make up 200 pages . it was poorly organized as well with different subjects per each chapter . for example chap . 8 is `` accountants '' through chapter 46 is a one page chapter on `` savings accounts . '' i couldnt believe how many words were used that never said anything . blah
