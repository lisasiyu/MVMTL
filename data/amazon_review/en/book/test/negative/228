did n't hold up over the years what was an exciting adventure novel back in the 1970 's for a young pre-teen ( was i ever so young ? ) on re-reading now turns out to be a silly james bond knock-off/summer beach book . the most grating conceit is the author 's habit of giving every *single* female charactor a `` clever '' name ( anna bidet - french , randi knickers-english , jemima brown-african american , etc ... ) . it has n't aged well
