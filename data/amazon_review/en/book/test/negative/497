a banal and brainlessly belligerent buffoon i read parts of this `` book '' until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and i immediately returned it to the library . what a stultifying simpleton this man is . he is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas . and unsurprisngly , this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the `` david letterman show '' and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity . first , he claimed that no one should criticize president bush `` because we 're at war and it 's no good for the country . '' come again ? i say that such a statement is `` no good '' for democracy , which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about . the right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the first amendment . and this man is a graduate of the john f. kennedy school of government ? also , he insisted that cindy sheehan , whose son was killed in iraq , not have the right to be publicly upset with president bush and the invasion of iraq because `` she 's connected with left-wing elements in this country . '' what left-wing elements ? i feel that cindy sheehan is as connected to left-wing elements as much as bill o'reilly is associated with logical reasoning .
