less than enthralling i was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing ( in an & quot ; advice o'the day & quot ; format ) of tidbits of wisdom . the wisdom offered is good , mind you , but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you ( eg on a long car ride ) you will likely be disappointed . i can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before i lose interest
