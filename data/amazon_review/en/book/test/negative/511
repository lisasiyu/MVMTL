some things taste good but be warned ! well i bought this book hoping that i could have more breakfast ideas especially now that my children are going to school full time and i dislike processed cereals . i am a domestic engineer who has studied culinary arts specializing in pasteries . all i have to say is that the recipes that i have tried taste alright but the timing is off . some pancake recipes call for a little much baking powder that gives the hotcakes a soapy flavour
