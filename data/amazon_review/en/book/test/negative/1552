no cd no buy i bought the panther edition of this book , and found it contained a great deal of useful information . however , i felt it did not serve well for a reference material for two reasons ... 1 . this book is huge . it needs to be perfect bound or made into two separate volumes . 2 . though the index is quite extensive , there is no way to adequately search the book for troubleshooting mac osx . both points would be obviated by the inclusion of a cd containing an ebook , preferably as a pdf . i reported this to the publisher , but apparently they disagree since this version does not include a disc . for this reason , i have decided not to purchase this book until future editions include this . i 'm writing this here in hopes that the publisher will read this , and act accordingly
