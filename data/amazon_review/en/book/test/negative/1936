the children 's big picture book of triathlon this is too basic to be helpful . the author admits taking most of the training plans published from popular web sites where they are published . it spends sentences describing what other books spend chapters on . i recommend triathlon 101 for beginners/intermediates and the triathlete 's training bible for experts/intermediates . great pictures though ( reason i gave it two stars instead of only one ) ? ! ?
