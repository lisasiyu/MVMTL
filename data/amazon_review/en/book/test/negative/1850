two stars is being nice . it was n't as impactful as i thought it would be . some of the people that gave comments gave some great comments and others , well , other gave comments . the selection of people was a good cross section but it did n't have meaning to it . i was looking for more in depth commentary . maybe what i was looking for should have been said between each of the comments in the book . it might have looked like hugh just collected a bunch of email and old letters and thrown them together
