pretty language but could n't stay awake this novel is comprised of pretty , well constructed sentences . that 's about all it is . pretty , well constructed sentences . the story itself could be interesting , after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested , let alone awake . the narrator , although the main character , was so far removed , emotionally , from her own telling of the story , that you wondered why she had bothered . at time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told .
