use caution the first few reviews are too harsh , i was given this as a gift so i am not as pissed off at the money . i give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero 's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book i expected much from anyway . the plot also gets way to over the top . i mean is there any plane or helicopter they can not learn to fly in a weekend ? hero 's invited to the summit by the president ! they escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to china ! also hero knew the guy was chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute , how many white folks can tell difference among non whites ? why are all the chinese americans bad guys as well ? the novel is way to heavy with anit chinese comments , has lot of what are just rants . see the other points in the publisher weekly review , but after considering them you may want to read the book , if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads , but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win . do not expect much and look for used copy , i paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before i cut him off .
