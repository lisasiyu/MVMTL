too politically correct i 'm glad to see i 'm not the only one to notice the anti-white preaching in this book . not what i expected at all because this is how history is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that . i was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned i already knew . i graduated from high school in '89 and then got a bachelor 's degree from a state college that was n't in history . perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education .
