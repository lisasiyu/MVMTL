simply awful this book could quite possibly be the most poorly-written book that i have ever read . the most glaring flaw is that the last approximately 40 pages are completely irrelevant compared with the rest of the book . since the book is only 200 pages long , this is quite a tangent for the author to take . within this section , the narrator descends into a self-pitying diary of his early adult years . i would like to point out that the plot of the book originally centered around his last year of high school . past this , the rest of the book suffers from a lack of development . many new characters and conflicts are introduced , only to disappear in the next chapter . the main character never develops , and the reader does not have the ability to empathize with his internal struggles . the book simply does not have redeeming qualities , and even takes a few moments to trash ayn rand ; since this is a book that young adults will probably read , it prevents them from forming and informed opinion about that author , controversial as she is . i was surprised and disappointed that this book was nominated for the pen/faulkner award . i strongly suggest that inquisitive readers look elsewhere for even mediocre reading material . 0 stars
