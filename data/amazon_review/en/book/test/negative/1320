a poetic , important , and terrible book mackinnon writes with smoothe , poetic prose , that disguises her petulant and arrogantly low estimation of the average women . the logical flaws only start there . the book is deeply myopic in its interpretation of history , just as marx 's work ( mackinnon 's ideal ) was . i recommend it only because of the woefully influential effect it is having on the u.s. judicial system - know thine enemy
