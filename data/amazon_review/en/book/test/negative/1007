disappointing ! i 've read several other mysteries by this author , but was quite disappointed in this one . the writing seemed `` padded '' -- i.e . paragraph after paragraph that did nothing to advance the plot . the plot itself was okay , but certainly not exceptional , and some of it was n't even believable . for example , although there was some explanation for the seemingly total imcompetence by the local police department ( understaffing ) , the idea that even a rookie ( much less the police chief ) would miss so many of the pertinent and obvious clues that an untrained 32 yr old shop owner ferreted out seems more than a little farfetched . another part of the plot that strained even the most willing suspension of disbelief is the handling of the dv incidents by the police . again , only the most incompetent of professionals would have handled the case they way it was . all in all , this novel was not one i 'd recommend to anyone .
