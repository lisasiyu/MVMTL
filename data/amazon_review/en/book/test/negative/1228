disappointing , not for families or budget watchers i purchased this book after reading the reviews on amazon . all those 5 star reviews convinced me ! they were wrong . i find more help in the owners manual i received with my new electric pressure cooker ! too many speciality ingredients that i do n't even know where to buy , much less whether we like or not . too many ingredients in general . i was looking for down home , easy , family-type meals , and found & quot ; gourmet & quot ; type recipes . i now check out the customer reviews rather than the & quot ; experts & quot ; and i read the reviews more carefully and watch for key words like simple , few ingredients , family , ingredients i find on my shelves , etc . i also check out table of contents when offered
