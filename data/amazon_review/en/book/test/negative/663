what a real eunuch has to say . i have not read this book but i am a real life eunuch . i had my testicles surgically removed . in an interview on salon.com the author says `` castration does not get rid of the sexual drive , get rid of erections or any amount of sexual activity . '' wrong ! ! ! how would he know any way ? he is not a eunuch . he has had a vasectomy but that is totally different . i can speak from experience ; when a man becomes a eunuch his sex drive drops to absolute zero . i had a very strong sex drive prior to castration but it is now completely gone . the only way for a eunuch to regain his sex drive is to take some form of testosterone replacement . i have never heard of any real life eunuch who was not on testosterone replacement therapy that had a sex drive . do n't waste your time on this book ; the author obviously did n't do enough , if any research . if you want to learn about eunuchs then search the web . there are a lot of us out there , and our numbers are growing
