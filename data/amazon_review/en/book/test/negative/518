read other books first i have recently completed reading babywise ii . i consider myself a christian and this book is extremely popular in my church . throughout the entire book , i had moments of complete confusion and disagreement accompanied by moments of complete agreement and lucidity regarding how to implement these methods . however , by the end , i realized that i should not be confused by or passionately against any section of a book that would truly benefit my child . while i believe there are some helpful and necessary methods in the book , i had already found much of that advice in other sources . for example , feeding schedules are advocated by many resources , but those other sources are very clear when it comes to making sure babies ' basic needs are met before implementing such routines . with my knowledge from other resources , i attempted to read babywise with a bit of grace , but at the same time i felt guilt and coercement at many points ; for instance , when i realized that my child was having one more meal a day than what is 'recommended ' by mr. ezzo for a child her age . for the record , my pediatrician generally recommends one more meal than she is receiving for a child her age . this concern and my confusion on other subjects in the book prompted me to speak to my husband about the book and i asked him to read it . he read only the forward and immediately became suspicious . he asked me if there were any references and i instantly realized there were none . it then became clear that the pediatrician listed as an author indeed had no authorship save the foreword , and that mr. ezzo has had no formal education regarding child development . a very quick search on the internet confirmed our deductions , and we found many articles against mr. ezzo 's methods , including a well documented student 's masters thesis . out of curiosity and still trying to find a way to defend this popular book , i performed internet searches on all of the other resources on child development we own ( four books ; all of which document research for their claims and advice ) and found absolutely no negative press for any . based on how unclear i found the teachings in the book and how much bad advice i had to sort out , i strongly urge anybody who reads this book to read other books first . as i said , i do n't disagree with all of the methods and advice , but it should be seen as advice from a person who has raised obedient ( not a bad thing ) children and has no other qualifications beyond that . you could do just as well asking advice from a friend or acquaintence with children who possess qualities you admire . as we all know every child is different and reacts to different discipline methods differently . please make sure you go to many resources to find the option best suited to your child . just an end note : as popular as this book is among my friends , i have not known anybody to follow the babywise book beyond feeding schedules and sleeping issues , and there is a good reason for that : not all of it is good advice
