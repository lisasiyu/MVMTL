agitating i found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena . i have no argument with the fact that it happens , or that many people have this take on the issue . however , the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay , exageration , and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism .
