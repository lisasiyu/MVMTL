my last reading of a jak why do i feel like the serpent in the garden of eden ? ... sorry , i really liked `` deep waters '' , but i probably wo n't buy another jak unless i am stuck at an airport and i have read every other available romance , mystery or thriller on the newsstand . i think i have made myself clear . it is time for me to find some new talented authors . although i know i have some previously read titles of hers to review . hopefully , they are better than this
