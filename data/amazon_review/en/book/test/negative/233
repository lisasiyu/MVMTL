ms . seaman does not discuss bio-identical hormones although i agree with much of what ms . seaman writes about synthetic estrogen , ( made from mares ' urine , ) and progestin , ( synthetic progesterone ) , i strongly disagree that all estrogen is potentially `` dangerous '' to the female body . ( pls . see dr. uzzi reiss 's comments on bio-identical estrogen in his wonderful book , natural hormone balance for women , in which he , ( dr. reiss ) , states : `` currently estrogen is `` under attack '' as a major risk factor in the epidemic of breast cancer . i find this ludicrous . estrogen is the hormone that distinguishes women 's unique gender . after 2 million yrs . of human evolution , could the female hormone suddently have turned into a serial killer ? would nature suddenly decide to create a one-gender species ? of course not . incriminating estrogen is as logical as saying that your liver is the cause of liver cancer . '' ( p. 28 of dr. reiss 's book ) . i thoroughly agree with dr. reiss . i , ( along with something like 70 % of women in menopause ) , had terrible symptoms of insomnia , lack of energy , lethargic depression , muscle/joint pain , and minor anxiety . it took me two yrs . of physical symptoms to finally discover bio-identical estrogen , and i consider it a `` lifesaver . '' it has literally given me back my sense of who i was before menopause . within 1-1/2 hrs . of taking the hormone , i became in control of my mind and mood again , regained my stamina , slept better than i had in 2 yrs. , and within a few days started to lose the excess wt . i had gained . my recommendation is that in addition to ms . seaman 's book , readers might like to read dr. reiss 's book , ( from a purely clinician point-of-view , ) , rather than just a political one . hooray for tri-est ! ! ( name of the bio-identical estrogen formula i used ) .
