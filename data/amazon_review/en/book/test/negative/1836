now i know why i did n't buy morrison 's run ... i really did n't enjoy this tpb that much , and it definitely enforced why i 'm not that fond of morrison 's writing on any x title from marvel . he brings the angst to the characters , and he writes them intelligently enough , but he also makes me dislike all of them . even normally upright characters like jean grey and cyclops were so twisted i forgot they were heroes in this . yuck . my main complaint is that i was hoping for a cleaner back history of wolverine 's weapon h/weapons plus origin , and i really did n't get that from this at all . instead , wolverine 's mission with cyclops is tacked on as an untidy footnote to three ( or four , i lost count ) issues focusing on the love triangle of emma frost , jean grey , and scott summers . i thought the title of the tpb was misleading because of that . the opening issue continues jean 's discovery of scott 's psychic infidelity with emma . jean barges into his thoughts and finds emma dressed up in her old phoenix costume , which was kind of tacky and bizarre , anyway , when you consider that emma 's old organization , the hellfire club , was responsible for jean turning into dark phoenix and subsequently destroying herself . my first thought was , why would that be a turn-on ? very twisted scene . so , jean strikes out at emma , invading her mind and plowing through her most private memories as she searches for the first moment when they started their affair . emma stays in character , not feeling as though she had done anything wrong by offering scott salvation from his unhappy marriage , and calling jean `` a playground bully '' hiding behind her righteous posturing . pot calling the kettle ... that issue itself offered sympathy for emma from unexpected sources , namely hank and logan , both of whom i automatically expected to side with jean . in the meantime , all any of them did was blame jean for the dissolution of her marriage by `` not taking care of it sooner . '' that alone made me not like this story . this arc was kind of odd going in because it was sandwiched between arcs of the other x titles without reflecting anything that was happening in the others . bishp and sage were both fresh from x-treme x-men , namely `` schism , '' after solving the jeffery garrett murders in alaska . the second issue to this story arc features a murder mystery , since emma is shot and shattered while in her diamond form . i 've heard readers comparing it to clue , but i do n't give it that much credit , i thought the plotting was weak . i noticed that sage and bishop never once implicated storm , who not only hates emma , but who openly threatened her with hurling a spear at her carried by tornado-strength winds to see if she would shatter . hello ? missed the boat there , grant . i 'm guessing storm 's name never came up simply because this was n't her book . oh well . the motive for emma 's murder was kind of silly ; two minor characters have a secret to hide in the farmhouse on the xavier property , and emma 's prize pupils , the stepford cuckoos , know what 's going on but wo n't spill their guts . the weapons plus arc started with what was actually a satisfying confrontation between logan and scott at the hellfire club . the artwork was weird , though . i like bachalo 's work on uncanny and new x-men academy , but he makes it darker , and the inks are heavy-handed . bachalo draws the ugliest cyclops i 've ever seen , and his wolverine looks like a gopher . in this scene , cyclops tells wolverine that he refuses to come back to the x-men , but logan instead recruits him for a big mission with fantomex , an upgraded weapons plus graduate who clarifies that logan was really weapon ten , not weapon x as previously assumed . this was the most poorly written issue of this collection , and it jumped around too much for me to tell where the action was taking place . somehow logan and scott ended up on an asteroid , presumably with help from e.v.a , fantomex 's ship . somehow they managed to escape , leaving logan behind to blow up the asteroid and destroy weapon fifteen . morrison and bachalo did n't even bother to pitch a knock-down , dragout battle between logan and fifteen that could have been the highlight of the story . it was a waste . the jump from jimenez 's clean penciling to bachalo 's more cartoony style is very stark and does not work . i longed for frank quitely 's pages instead , feeling he would have done a better job of conveying the images . as a lead-in to the much more important `` planet x '' arc ( still not one of my favorites , but better than this drivel ) , this book was very weak . overall , i 'm sorry i spent the money on this story , and i will avoid morrison 's back issues going forward
