incomplete book omits key topic any book that claims to fit real people has to address the issue of fitting pants , particularly for women since we are still stuck with designs based on men 's pants . while these authors have written a separate book in this series specifically for fitting pants , & quot ; pants for real people & quot ; , this current book is sadly mis-titled and needs to clearly state that it does not address pants . as 5'10 & quot ; woman with a long lower torso and a sway back , fitting pants is difficult to say the least . for an all-encompassing book that addresses fitting issue , see singer sewing 's & quot ; perfect fit & quot ; , which has lots of pictures , clear directions for both major and minor alterations , before and after shots , and deals with all subjects . for a book specifically for fitting pants , i recommend singers & quot ; pants that fit & quot ; . i own both and use both regularly
