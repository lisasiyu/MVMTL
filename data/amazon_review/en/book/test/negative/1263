could n't get past errors and arrogance the authors of this book purport to tell the history of herb and plant use for religious purposes throughout history . they especially focus on plants that have hallucinogenic , healing , or toxic qualities . only trouble is , i find it hard to trust the authors ' word on how to use dangerous plants when they make errors so often in other areas . for example , they claim that henry viii had syphilis , passed it on to his children , and therefore none of them lived past infancy . ummm ... except for the *three* who grew up to rule england ? and in a table of plants sacred to various greek goddesses , they mention that the pomegranate is sacred to hera , but do not connect it to persephone at all , which seems a pretty big oversight in light of her myth . then , they go on to talk about witches ' flying ointments and how deadly they were -- but ridicule modern witches who concoct less fatal blends to help them go into trance . there may very well be treasures in this book . i 'd just be too afraid to trust the authors ' accuracy
