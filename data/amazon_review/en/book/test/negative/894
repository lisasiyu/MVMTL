the book is being overrated i personally feel that the the book is small , being rightly meant to be carried by residents in wards , but cramped with borrowed information which exceeds the capacity of the book . a lot of it feature in other standard texts and nothing is new.the algorithms too are borrowed . information on antibiotic usage and common tropical disorders in detail are lacking . unnecessary publicity is being given to the book and the osler medical handbook by cheng and zaas is far superior to this in all aspects . another important aspect is that students reading the book do not read standard texts and are clearly at a disadvantage while appearing in examinations.the book needs to be rewritten in another format to be successful . professor k.n.viswanathan , avmc , pondicherry , indi
