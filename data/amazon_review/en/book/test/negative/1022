somewhat interesting but hardly a `` must-read '' `` the hitler book '' , a posthumous biography of hitler personally prepared for stalin , is of interest only as a historical curiosity and for the insight it provides into the strange political dynamics of postwar stalinist russia . interestingly enough , and contrary to press reports and the claims of the researchers in question , this book was not recently `` discovered '' by a couple of german scholars digging around the russian archives . david irving used this dossier in the 1960s when writing his magnificent `` hitler 's war '' , which is_the_book i would recommend for those interested in a life of hitler , particularly his years in power . based on the interrogations of otto guensche and heinz linge ( hitler 's ss adjutant and manservant respectively ) , this book covers most of the major events of hitler 's life more or less accurately , but should not be taken as an authoritative work of history . it 's a gossipy , biographical caricature based on both public knowledge and the torture-induced testimonies of a butler and an aide . that 's not to say that guensche 's and linge 's testimony should n't be trusted , but two low-level witnesses do not a biography make and , in any case , their information should be compared with what they freely told western authors , like david irving and james o'donnell , after their decade in soviet captivity . this book reveals no new information , and is also marred by the fact that it shamelessly panders to the prejudices and paranoia of its very important audience of one : josef stalin . it obviously makes no mention of the ribbentrop/molotov pact and subsequent soviet expansion into poland , finland , romania and the baltic states , and certainly does n't deal with soviet agressive intentions toward germany or the reasons for the disasters of 1941 . its portrait of hitler sticks to the wartime propaganda line , showing him as a feral , rug-chewing , cowardly maniac . and while the soviet union did indeed bear the brunt of the fighting against nazi germany , this book seriously downplays the anglo-american contribution , deprecates the bravery and effectiveness of their troops and even accuses the western allies of trying to negotiate a separate peace with hitler and of not bombing armaments factories whose weapons they knew would be used exclusively against the soviets . it 's an interesting look into the dark maze of stalinist psychology , but is not the source to consult for a legitimate hitler biography
