nothing new delightfully short in length , `` the good body '' takes a mere hour to peruse and completely read ... which is a blessing . the repetitious cliches used to re-assure women that whatever the body form or shape , the body is good . there is nothing new to enlighten or educate the reader , and nothing one has n't read or heard beforehand . regardless of how compelling an argument in favor of an unaltered natural appearance the author puts forth , the bottom line is that in our global community looks and body shape do still make a difference in a woman 's life choices and success . this feminist rhetoric is no different than that which has been preached since the onslaught of `` feel good about yourself '' books in the 1960 's , 70 's and 80 's .
