not much new information when you have read 'kaizen ' already the book gemba-kaizen is somewhat disappointing if you have read the book 'kaizen ' already . it gives not much new information . the only new idea in the book is the attention given to the 'gemba ' , the place where the processes are performed . imai is right to stress the importance of the gemba for operational excellence and he gives some nice tools and examples to illustrate the gemba 's importance . however , only one nice idea is somewhat poor to fill a whole book . the major message of the book can be told just as well in an articel of no more then 4 pages
