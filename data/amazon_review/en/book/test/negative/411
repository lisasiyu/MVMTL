weak link in a great series i read a is for alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series . years later i read s is for silence and was hooked . i started to read the series -- backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning . i have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine ( and forgiven ms. grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6 '' frame ) . however , i agree with the other readers who feel like this is not grafton at her best . you just ca n't believe that kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions -- -belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating , remaining in an incredibly ( and unbelievable ) dangerous situation , to name a few . the dialogue is weak , the sexual situations seem gratutitous , and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics . but even with these issues , i did finish the book . grafton at her low point is still a good read
