the worst self-hypnosis book . i own a large collection of hypnosis books and this one has to be the most lame , poorly written and uninformative book on this subject i have come across . if you are a hippy-dippy new age moron this book is for you , but if you are looking for a real book on hypnosis , avoid this book or waste your money . nuff said
