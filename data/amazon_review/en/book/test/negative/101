loved the book , hated the reading this review refers to the audio-book . i 'm a huge james lee burke fan , but i found the reading of this book to be unbearable . i have listened to mark hammer read before and have enjoyed his renditions of other authors like elmore leonard , but here he just sounds tired , sloppy and unconvincing as a cajun reader . his performance is unidimensional and lacks any variety . when he attempts to mimic a southern accent it sounds like someone from detroit imitating gomer pyle . towards the end of the reading , it sounded like he needed to clear his throat . if you want to hear a stellar reading , try another james lee burke work `` purple cane road '' read by will patton .
