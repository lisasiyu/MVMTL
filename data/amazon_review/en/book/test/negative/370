this book misses the point i think susan sontag is missing the political nature of illness . as far as i 'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine . the victim is blamed because the victim has little power . the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful , the oil companies are powerful , the sugar companies are powerful , the retail chains are powerful , the manufacturers are powerful , the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful . they have armies of lawyers to defend them ; they have armies of doctors , scientists , and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest , but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame . this is n't about language , it 's about politics of money and power . language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill , and victims more generally
