harlequin presents ... nicholas sparks while easy enough to read , if the exact same pages were enclosed in a harlequin romance cover , i would n't know the difference . i 'm extremely surprised this is a `` best seller '' . maybe i should take up writing because i ca n't possibly be worse than this . ok , it 's a good enough story but wow , it 's predictible and boring . i read it completely in 2 days , and i 'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while . i was n't intrigued , i was n't on the edge of my seat , and did n't shed a tear
