are the authors qualified to write this book ? it does not seem that thomas pauley is particularly rich . one of his best success stories is getting a good loan rate so he could buy a used mercedes that had 55,000 miles on it . that 's rich ? ! it seems that if he were `` rich beyond his wildest dream '' he would pay cash for for any new car available and not think twice about it . there is also a fair amount of nutty ideas like `` if most of the world believed in fairies , unicorns and mermaids , you would see them running around all of time . '' one of the most objectionable ideas is his concept of tithing . he makes god out to be some sort of cosmic accountant that will strike back at you is he does not get his 10 % . additionally mr. pauley 's concept of tithing is very specific . according to mr. pauley giving to a church or charity is not tithing . giving 10 % to a rock star because you are inspired by his lyrics is fine ( as in the case of his son ) . if fact he would say that giving to poor people would be `` foolish spending '' . you should tith to your spiritual source . i get the distinct impression that he wants me to kick back 10 % to him . there are a few good ideas like make lists and get specific about your goals but it is never followed up by an action plan . you should just put in your order and wait for the universe to fill it . mr pauley covers himself with a hugh loophole which is , if this system did n't work for you it means that the universe did n't want you to have it . i suggest napolin hill 's `` think and grow rich '' instead .
