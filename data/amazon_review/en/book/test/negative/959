night hoops this book was a great book . i like the way trent was helped by nick . one thing i did n't like was the violence . i am not a big fan of basketball , or any other sport , but this book really touched me . i would recommend this book to anyone even if they are n't a lover of sports . that is what i thought about night hoops . sunny block
