book condemns hinduism without quoting any hindu scripture . rabi maharaj is confused about hinduism , the `` culture-religion '' in which he was born and raised . except the part that he was born in a hindu family , rabi is totally ignorant of the concept of god in hinduism . christians worship one & only god in three persons ; hindus worship one & only god in trillions of forms . fact of the matter is , this concept of one & only god , started during rig vedic period in india , at least 1000 years before the birth of hebrew civilization in the land of cannon . the hindu rig veda 1:164:46 states `` ekam sat viprah bahudha vadanti -- -- `` there is only one god [ truth ] , but sages call that god many names '' . another ancient hindu scripture yajurveda 32 : 2 states `` na tasya pratima asti '' [ there is no image of him ] ... another hindu scripture svetasvatara upanishad 4:19 states `` his form is not to be seen ; no one sees him with naked eye . '' ravi should also know that hindus do not worship icons but like everybody else use `` icons '' to concentrate on a god who has `` no name or form . '' i have a question for rabi and the great apologetic , radio-tv talk show guest dave hunt . you quote thousands of verses from the holy bible , when ever you wanted to talk , preach and write about christianity . so my question to you , `` why you failed to quote even one verse from a hindu scripture to prove your arguments against hinduism ? in my review , i quoted many verses from the hindu scriptures to prove hindus worship only one god . why authors of this book failed to quote not even one verse from a hindu scripture to prove their arguments ? how can you ridicule or condemn a culture/ religion like hinduism about 1 billion people on earth practice , with out even quoting one verse from a hindu scripture ? unless by writing this book their intention was to follow the foot steps of dr. joseph goebbels , propaganada minister of the third reich who said , `` repeat a lie thousand times and it becomes the truth .
