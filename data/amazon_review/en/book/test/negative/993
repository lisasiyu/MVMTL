look for teach yourself catalan in recent years , routledge has gone from consistently producing excellent language courses to producing some excellent courses and some bad courses . unfortunately , colloquial catalan is a prime example of the very worst colloquial courses . the main error in this course is the fact that it 's exceptionally limited . after completing some of the more extensive colloquial courses , you will master the grammar of the language and have a solid basic vocabulary . colloquial courses like colloquial italian , colloquial czech , colloquial albanian or colloquial icelandic list over 2000 words . the average colloquial courses list 1000-1500 words . in sharp contrast , colloquial catalan does n't even reach 600 words ! in my opinion , the colloquial courses are often a better option than teach yourself courses , but that 's not the case with catalan . teach yourself catalan will teach you more than twice as much as colloquial catalan .
