feist ... ..you could n't do better than steal old marvel comic storylines ? the riftwar was a good saga . pug was good . tomas was good . arutha was good . everything was good . then feist came out with this series ... anyone who wants to know the plotline for this one just save yourself the money and read the atlantis attacks comic books by marvel , the eternals by jack kirby , and the fantastic # 337-340 and then you 'll easily see where feist stole this storyline from . a dreaming mad god that influences a world around him , that 's buried under a mountain , whose thoughts become reality ? /a dreaming black celestial from a race of space gods who is buried under a mountain and can control reality around him and is trying to destroy the universe ? c'mon , i ca n't believe i 'm the only who has seen this . everyone takes ideals from someone , hence tolkien syndrome , but to couple it with this sorry book ( ie a stupid book where a stupid pug that throws fireballs but ca n't dodge them and ca n't time travel like in other books and ca n't deal with a minor demon captain ) insults the people that made the dreaming celestial ( king kirby ) and the eternals . if he was gon na steal ideas , he should have made the entire book worthwhile . in this book , besides the old guard , erik is the only guy we really care about . characters that were developed in the two lackluster books before are killed off before they have a chance to sign and we 're left with characters like miranda , whom we do n't reall any thing for at all . all in all , a very poor effort in the serpentwar saga . feist gets an a for stealing storylines and an f for originality . i 'll stick to newer guys like simon r green , aaron mccarty , and ferrenzano for new takes on fantasy/sci fi .
