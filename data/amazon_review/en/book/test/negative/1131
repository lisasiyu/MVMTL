wow ! i consider myself a fairly well-read individual and as a 1st generation mexican american , i thought this would be an interesting book to read read . early on , it became abundantly clear what this book was about . it was garbage . the moral of the story is that if you want a better life , your s- outta luck . settle for what you have and do n't ask for more ! `` materialism is bad '' . is n't materialism and the right to complain what this country was built on ?
