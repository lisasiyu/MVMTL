dissapointed if you are looking to obtain a basic knowlege of web programming , then this is not the book for you . i wanted a basic guide , but the author managed to create a book that is too basic . yes , i was able to get my first website up on the internet , but it does n't do anything . for that , i 'll need to buy another book .
