devoid of new , practical information or advice this book does n't offer any recommendations for putting any of the advice re : better self-care in place except to suggest perhaps brewing your own coffee at home to save money to hire all the help one needs to make it all a reality . for those of us who already believe `` if mama ai n't happy ai n't nobody happy '' & set our coffee makers to brew for the morning promptly after getting our babies to sleep for the night , who would like nothing better than a regular date night with our husbands , some quality alone time , and regular refreshing breaks from our kids , this is a frustrating time-waster . perhaps much of this book 's advice is better suited to mothers of older children who have enough disposable income to hire babysitters *and* housekeepers *and* take yoga classes *and* get monthly massages *and* take mini-vacations alone , etc.. the answer , i 'm sorry to say ( because it is far less satisfactory than blaming mothers for suffering martyrdom complexes & suggesting yoga to help mothers feel more `` balanced '' ) is a widespread cultural change that makes affordable child care the norm , and helps men & women shoulder the burdens of raising their children more evenly . a much more worthwhile read is `` perfect madness : motherhood in the age of anxiety '' by judith warner . i give `` the balanced mom '' two stars simply for acknowledging that motherhood is incredibly hard work and those doing that work need to be valued ( and value themselves for doing it ) , which means taking necessary breaks for sustainable self-care
