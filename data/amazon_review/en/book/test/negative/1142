sadly disappointed having followed the mrs. murphy mysteries over the years , i am sorry to say that this volume leaves me wanting ... wanting a good mystery ! ms brown seems to have dipped into a formula method for compiling her books . what started the series as bright , witty and compelling , now lacks style , substance and charm . the animals have become more vocal and unbelievable with each new volume and the sidebars into instructional content and social commentary are too distracting . perhaps it 's time to put mrs. murphy and friends away for a bit until a real plot surfaces
