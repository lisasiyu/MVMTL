only theoretically good there 's a lot to like in this book , theoretically . the worlds themselves are well-drawn , the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty ( that sort of mimics but does n't really ever come close to the best that william gibson has given us ) . the science is seamlessly integrated into the story , and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure . the theory does n't hold , though . this just is n't a very good book . the action follows three different characters , along three different threads . at first , and for most of the book , they have no obvious connection with each other . their stories appear to unravel aimlessly , and although lots of stuff happens , none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story . it has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations , physical or moral . there is a payoff , but it takes a long time to get there , and by the time i did i was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it did n't really have much of an impact . there are three major problems with this book : information withholding : i like books with central mysteries , that make you wait ( and work ) to understand what 's going on . it 's a good propulsive technique , plot-wise . but the mysteries need to resolve . the author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through , dropping occasional hints that are n't so much tantalizing as frustrating . as i said : by the time i figured out what was going on , i 'd stopped caring . this might just be my limitations as a reader , but i gather , from other reviews , that a lot of people feel the same way . you work so hard to understand what 's going on that it 's difficult to enjoy any of it . dreams : harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot : to elucidate the characters ' psychology , and to give us a window into their past . this is unfortunate , because ( in my mind ) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition , instead of wending it into the story . generally speaking , as soon as i hit a dream sequence , i lose interest . i lost interest a lot in this book . which is a shame , because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful , strange and sometimes even touching . it just needs to be presented better . unremitting dourness : there is nothing pleasant about reading this book . the main characters are either savage and unlikeable , pitiable and unlikeable , or mystifying and unlikeable . often all three . and , with the exception of the wife ( who i liked almost as much as i pitied ) , none of the supporting characters are much use either . the worlds they inhabit are brutal , dire , unpleasant , and dour . there 's a lot of sex here , but as portrayed it 's mostly just another kind of violence . the whole thing 's kind of a downer , pretty much the whole way through , and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing , as if it 's been grafted on from another , happier book . the writing itself has some odd lapses too , given the care that went into the structure of the book , and the obvious attention to detail . lots of tortured , passive sentences . a few bits of dialogue that sound like campy chandler . harrison is obviously very talented . i wanted very much to like this book , and i suspect i 'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future . there 's a great deal of potential here . it 's just that most of it went unrealized
