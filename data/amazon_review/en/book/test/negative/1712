benford 's work is not a sequel ; it 's a rebuttal . i 'm reminded of the story of a well-known sf writer who as an experiment tried revising e.e . & quot ; doc & quot ; smith 's galactic epics to remove the obsolete and clunky bits only to find he 'd removed all the fun along with them . it 's only by virtue of not tampering with the original text that benford avoids commiting the same fault but with premeditation . of course & quot ; against the fall of night & quot ; is obsolete sf . that does n't matter . what matters is its atmosphere , and it is this atmosphere that benford rejects systematically and irreverently . clarke might not have objected to the changes , but authors view their works very differently than the readers do
