i got to page two ... i made it to page two of the text ( page seven of the book ) and got disgusted with her style . from this page alone : ka-boom . and this man skinner . maniacal psychologist . baby in a box so as to raise her . whatever humanity he touched turned to bone . [ ? ] . this i know to be true . this much we presume we know . genuine court of law . boom-boom went the gun . note there is not one quotation mark here . this is her writing and the editor 's editing . i do n't know if i can go on ! i 'm very sorry i bought this book .
