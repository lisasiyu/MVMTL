ineffectiously infectious this book tries to explain how and why the media would try to send out its ideals to the masses through a selective expos√© of certain television programs such as the simpsons , beavis and butthead , ren & stimpy show , murphy brown , la law , cops ; political and celebrity personalities like the bush 's , bill clinton , william borroughs , phil donahue , rush limbough , peewee herman ( paul reubens ) , the jacksons , madonna , ice t , and even quite peculiar for me even the whole controversy with one of my personal faves u2 over the legal frictions with a parody band called negativland ( which is rather more documented on the documentary feature flick of the said group ) and even more so about the band that i often refer to - jesus jones regarding their music video for their perrenial track `` right here right now '' and the advent of mtv 's outbreak with the likes of music videos from a-ha ; bruce springsteen ; and even more so mentioning the likes of `wanna-whats ' like r.u . serious , and the cult of genesis p-orrige called thee temple ov psychic youth - the book nearly gives an impression that the author is culture-shocked , and proposed to infect likewise with the `memes ' ( ie . a term used by the author to refer about the certain data/info 's that are being assimilated n=by the media which in turn affects to influence the masses , at least in the way i understood it and could simply put it ) it presents to expose - however , the whole matter is subject to the particular perspective preference of the readers personal comprehension . the book is said to have been `` revised and updated '' from a two-year 's span by 1996 - even seems quite un-innovative even from that time , and most of the authors ' analysis are nothing new . rushkoff , although being quite informative nevertheless from time to time with the book only seem to mainly dwell on a surface level , when what we need is to see more of the primal motivating factors behind the dissemination of counter-culture trends and ideas which rushkoff attempted to disseminate within the length of his work .
