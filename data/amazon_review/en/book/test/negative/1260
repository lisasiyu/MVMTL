interesting clips , but not a good book it took me a couple months to get through this book . although there are many interesting clips [ from the author 's magazine interviews over the years ] , the book does not hang together . it appears that the author attempted to weave the stories together into some kind of themes , by decade : but there is really no & quot ; greater insight & quot ; provided . i would have preferred to read an anthology of more in-depth commentaries on a few female artists . i also found ms. hirshey 's ornate writing style to be difficult reading
