disappointed ! i 'm so glad i only got this book out of the library . i would want my money back if i had paid for it ! granted i am only trying my first recipe from it now ( linzer roll cookies ) , but the directions are contradictory and full of errors . for instance , the recipe tells you to roll the dough out into one 10 inch square and in the next sentences tell you what to do with the rectangles of dough . so we go from one square to some rectangles . so nick , which one is it supposed to be ? i guess i 'll just have to wing it ! hello , is n't a professional pastry chef supposed to know his stuff ? i 'll stick with the king arthur flour , their new cookie book is fabulous as is their complete baking book
