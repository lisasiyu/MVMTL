unfortunately boring i 'm a very spiritual person and i was expecting this cd to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life . unfortunately , for me at least , the cd is rather boring and not very inspirational . i 'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it . fortunately i have a christian radio station that does a lot more for me .
