learn the lessons of history or repeat it boy , i hate to point out a negative here , but to say that fundamentalism is a way of holding a belief and not about content is historically ill informed . fundamentalism began as a reaction against denominational seminaries adopting theological views that were viewed as against scripture in their content . here are a few of those issues . you tell me if you think they are content or ways of holding it : jesus was not born of a virgin . many of the miracles of jesus were fictional . jesus did not necesarily raise from the dead . most of the more outrageous old testament stories were not to be taken as historically accurate . i could go on . has he not read what really happened historically to create that movement ? ? ? big mistake , or real dishonest ! even now rollins goes about building what they reacted against . rollins says he will not be undermining chrisitan content , but he is opening the door for those who will . in fact , for him to make the following statement about life after death makes me wonder if he really cares about truth or his post modern posture . `` death is a term that refers to the end of all experience . regardless of what , if anything , happens after this event , ... '' page 47 he strives to make his own point at the expense of christian truth . fundamentalism , even today , in it 's popularly decried `` no fun , too much dam , and not enough mental '' caricature is really primarily about content and only secondarily about how they hold their views . it was born in a fight and rollins wants to take us back into the fight . evangelicalism is the answer as to content and holding it rightly , but rollins really does not believe in answers .
