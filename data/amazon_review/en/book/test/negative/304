is he even writing anymore ? ? ? ? after reading his last few book with `` co-authors '' i wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the `` co-author '' . i have been a fan of mr. patterson since my first alex cross novel almost 10 years ago . while i still enjoy the cross books , i find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out . alex-vs- the vampire cult ? ? ? kyle craig a serial killer ? ? ? alex joins the fbi ? ? ? give me a break . i can only hope from the description of cross x the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves
