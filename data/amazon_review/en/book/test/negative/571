misleading this is a very misleading book . there were many points that i would criticize , but it would take an entire book to do that . so i 'll pick out three important issues and focus on those . issue one : welfare and out of wedlock childbirths one example is the effect of welfare on out of wedlock childbirths . on page 59 iceland criticizes the theory that welfare payments are responsible for increased rates of out of wedlock childbirths . iceland points to the fact that inflation-adjusted welfare payments have declined , whereas out of wedlock childbirths have increased . but single mothers are available for other assistance programs such as food stamps , public housing , and medicaid . when the full package of benefits is included , the total aid available to single mothers has kept up with inflation . on page 136 iceland cites robert moffit 's 1992 research showing that welfare has only caused a slight increase in out of wedlock childbirths . but after other researchers such as mark rosenzweig and the economists jeff grogger and stephen bronars found a large connection , moffit reexamined the issue . his more thorough methodology and found that welfare did cause a significant increase in out of wedlock childbirths . moffit reported this in 1998 . why did iceland mention his 1992 research but not his 1998 research ? issue two : the color of poverty one problem is that iceland documents the fact that poverty statistics show that most of the poor are white . on page 38 he criticizes the fact that most media reports tend to show pictures of blacks when discussing poverty , thus creating a false perception . but as iceland discusses , most poverty is short term , usually from a divorce , a death , or a lost job . on page 49 he mentions that black children make up a majority of the long term poor . i would submit that when people think about poverty they think about long term poverty , not brief poverty spells . like it or not , americans have to grapple with the fact that entrenched , generational poverty is disproportionately black . issue three : cause of poverty the biggest problem with the book is its analysis of the cause of poverty . it concludes that out of wedlock childbirths are a minor cause relative to the inequality embedded in a free market , capitalist society . but the way it reaches that conclusion is through a statistical analysis in which possible causes are each treated as independent variables to see which explains the greatest amount of poverty . but supporters of the theory that poverty is caused by out of wedlock childbirths do not blame the out of wedlock birth in itself . after all , college educated single mothers show that an out of wedlock childbirth is not necessarily a ticket to poverty . the problem is the lost opportunity in terms of the chance of graduating high school and college . page 422 of the bipartisan policy book 'the new world of welfare ' documents the fact that while most out of wedlock childbirths happen to women in their 20 's , half of all *first* out of wedlock childbirths happen to women in their teens ( fortunately this is on the decline ) . this is early enough to interfere with the mother 's education , and makes it much more likely that she will drop out , or not go to college . the lesson is that the other factors that cause poverty , such as education , are dependent upon family breakdown . they are not independent variables , and any statistical analysis that treats them as though they were independent will come up with flawed results . there is another problem . even if iceland is correct that out of wedlock childbirths do not cause poverty , the research of sara mclanahan and gary sandefur in their landmark book 'growing up with a single parent ' documents the fact that children of single mothers are more likely to drop out of school , abuse drugs , suffer from depression or low self-esteem , have lower lifetime earnings , and are more likely to have out of wedlock children themselves . furthermore , only about half of this gap can be attributed to poverty itself . fatherlessness is an independent contributing factor . i would instead recommend that interested readers check out 'the new world of welfare ' edited by rebecca blanks and ron haskins . it is a bipartisan collection of essays on welfare and poverty representing the left and right . it is interesting that none of the `` liberal '' contributors disagreed with the `` conservative '' claim that family breakdown is an important cause of poverty . and on the other side , none of the `` conservatives '' disagreed with the liberal claim that although welfare reform has been successful , there have been some women who are worse off . the liberal theory could be put this way : `` family breakdown is an important cause of poverty , but we need to find a way to both provide aid *and* fix the family . '' the only differences are on policy prescriptions , not analysis . it is a refreshing bit of consensus in an otherwise acrimonious debate . i would also recommend 'civil rights ' by thomas sowell and 'the marriage problem ' by james wilson
