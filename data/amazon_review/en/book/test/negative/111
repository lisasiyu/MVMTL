mediocre maron this is not one of the better entries to this series . after successfully balancing an intriguing mystery with an important wedding in `` rituals of the season '' it is disappointing to have this story be such a mismash . in this book , readers are finally introduced to dwight 's ex-wife and his son , cal , but there is no development of either as characters . this is such a strong point to maron 's writing -- evocative descriptions of people and places -- that it disconcerting to put down this book and not feel like i have just been on a trip to north carolina ( or virginia . ) the characters are flat and unlikeable , the `` mystery ( s ) '' are odd and the plot just is n't there . still , any margaret maron/deborah knot mystery is better than none , and the actions in this story will have an impact on deborah and dwight 's future , but do n't read this expecting a thrilling or clever mystery ; read it as a segue to the next book in the series
