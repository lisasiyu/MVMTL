avoid this book at all costs this author claims that the baudelaire children can not see through count olaf 's disguises , which is patently absurd , as any reader of the snicket series would know . she has squandered all her credibility by making this absurd claim , and i would not recommend this book to my dog as a chew toy , let alone to anyone to read . either she did n't read the books , did n't really absorb what she read , or most likely , merely skimmed the books and paid little attention to them in her haste to capitalize on snicket 's good name . do n't read this book , do n't get it from a library , it is a big waste of time .
