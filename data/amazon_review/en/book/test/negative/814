lies , damned lies , and statistics it was mark twain who popularized the aphorism of benjamin disraeli that there are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies , and statistics . i kept hearing all these marvelous things about freakonomics , a book by steven levitt and stephen dubner , so when i ran across it at 25 % off , i did a stupid freakin ' thing and bought it . i thought , what the freak , i 've got a pretty inquisitive mind and i 'm open to seeing things differently , to discovering new viewpoints . the doubt started early when i got the book home and i first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of time , the new york times , the washington post , and the los angeles times . when all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is , i 'm immediately going to be freakin ' suspicious . author malcolm gladwell tells us on the cover , `` prepare to be dazzled . '' well , evidently ol ' malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than i am . ( i wo n't even mention the smug mug of stephen dubner that taunted me from the book 's dust jacket because i do n't want you to get the idea that i judge a book by its cover . or in this case , a writer by his physiognomy . so i wo n't mention that . ) if you 're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70 % of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver 's home , then you just might be dazzled by freakonomics . if i tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts , thinking that it is cutting costs , is probably increasing its overhead , and this fact astounds you - if you must ask `` but how ? '' - then yes , buy freakonomics and be dazzled . mostly what freakonomics offers ( when its conclusions can be trusted ) is just what we used to call `` common sense . '' but since america has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent , brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of survivors , and american idols , and lost knuckleheads , good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead ( when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands , that is ) . i dove into freakonomics hoping to find my purchase worthwhile . i got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized : everything would require second-guessing and verifying . on that page , smug mug tells us ( based on a single report by the institute of medicine ) that `` drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health . '' fortunately , i read your body 's many cries for water by doctor f. batmanghelidj over a decade ago so i already knew what a bunch of bunk that was . in chapter 4 , smug mug `` proves '' that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the roe v. wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate . this represents the centerpiece of his book , both literally and ideologically . the first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s . on page 92 , the author acknowledges that the police in atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 olympics . well , would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted ? true , being honest might be means to an increased budget , but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control . and surely the chamber of commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception . let me ask , do you actually feel you 're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s ? that 's funny , me neither . there 's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported , and recently , an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now . in dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime ( if this claim is a verity ) , dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10 % of the drop . having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian , it 's funny that i find myself even contending with the stats smug mug uses that actually work against his theory : i believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10 % - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly . and dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws `` simply do n't bring down crime . '' ( be sure to read the utterly fascinating book , gunfighters , highwaymen & vigilantes by roger d. mcgrath , for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint ! ) in dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion , i did n't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s , and i wonder if that might have some statistical bearing . ya think ? yes , i think smug mug is selective . he calls some abortions a `` crude and drastic sort of insurance policy . '' not `` immoral . '' not `` sinful . '' but then i did n't expect smug mug to call a sin a sin . and even if levitt and dubner 's hypothesis is correct , that abortions have lowered crime , the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person , but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered . so why are we even discussing this ? i 'll tell you why : because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus , and now they 're pulling out all the stops , trying to `` statistically '' convince the masses that they 're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing . i find this repulsive ! ( and there are studies indicating that those missing people have , and will continue to have , a negative economic impact on society . ) i wo n't even go into chapter 5 , what makes a perfect parent ? suffice to say that as usual ( surprise ! surprise ! ) all the statistics dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue . funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs . just know that if you 're a working mother , you have n't cheated your child in the least , but if you 're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order , you are `` unenlightened . '' if your kid is watching lots of tv , it is n't turning the `` child 's brain to mush . '' ( no word on whether or not it 's turning his/her morals to mush though . ) and the studies ( that we are called to pay attention to ) show `` that a child 's character was n't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care , whether he had one parent or two , whether his mother worked or did n't , whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each . '' ( i 've often wondered what might have happened to me if my mom , who was home most of the time , had n't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day , year after year , while i was growing up in the `60s and `70s . ) i 've given freakonomics two stars because i did find the section on the naming of children very interesting , as well as the story of stetson kennedy 's fight against the `` three ks . '' but if you 're smarter than i am , you 'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it . economically speaking , that 's just `` common cents . ''
