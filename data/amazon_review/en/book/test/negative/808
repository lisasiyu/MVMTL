a tragedy indeed ... . `` the last river - the tragic race for shangri-la '' ... ... .tragic . yes i 'd agree that this book is tragic . tragic that i bothered reading it ... ..tragic that i paid for it in order to read it ... ..tragic that todd wasted his time writing it ... ... tragic that i disliked it so much that i can be bothered writing a review . the warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket . `` advance praise for the last river '' it reads . in retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it . it seems that todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be , and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal . so much of the content has so little relevancy to the story , that you soon tire trawling through it . this was my third tsango experience . i do recommend the outside documentary on the lindgren expedition . `` hell or high water '' is not outstanding , but is worth a read , but on this book , my advise to todd is please make this the last river that you drag through the wringer
