not what expected at all i bought this book as a gift for a friend based on the great categories it has to offer for recording book information . i was so disappointed to find that the spaces allowed for writing are so small . also , the book is hard to navigate . the hard cover and hard binding do n't allow for anyone to write it in it ( inflexible ) . i gave it as a gift still , but i had to apologize for what a cruddy book it was
