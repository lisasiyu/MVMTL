pontification at its most verbose the 30 second spot is dead . the 30 second spot is dead ! the 30 second spot is dead ! alright , i get it already . at least i did after the first 60 pages or so . unfortunately this book does not end at 60 pages . never have so many words been used to say so little . the first third of this book ( plus one chapter online ) ( parenthesis meant as a tribute to jaffe ) tells you why the 30 second spot is dead . to illustrate the demise of the 30 second spot , jaffe uses a dead horse and beats it repeatedly . perhaps jaffe is quite funny and clever at a party , but his schtick gets a little old when trudging through 276 pages of his quips ( plus one chapter online ) . jaffe fashions himself as a modern day don rickles , passing out insults to everything and everybody who uses a 30 second spot . unfortunately , this increases the page count of the book by about 90 pages . the final two-thirds of the book is a survey of everything you can use instead of the 30 second spot . jaffe says you have 10 options and he has designed 10 little logos for each of them ( which you can see on his website ) ( again parenthesis meant as a salute to jaffe ) . this is not any ground breaking information . if you have been paying attention and made occasional contact with society , you will have realized that you can use the internet as a marketing tool . mostly , jaffe 's observations are re-hashes of stuff you can find in a trade journal or two . and because this is an adweek book , i suspect most of this stuff was available in an adweek article . the important thing about this survey portion of the book is that it gives you very little insight on how to use these tools more effectively . it 's just jaffe telling you that you are ignorant if you are not using his 10 alternatives to the 30 second spot . save yourself $ 20 and get a subscription to adweek instead
