what a disappointment blum 's biography of harlow does an excellent job of examining the man and the scientist , `` warts and all . '' yes , it 's unflinching in its descriptions of the experiments performed on macaques showing the effects of maternal deprivation ; yes , it 's unflinching on showing the psychology of the man who performed these experiments and the sad effects his psychological predispositions had on his personal life . poor monkeys ! poor harlow ! but never fear ; blum is here to provide us with reassurance : it all had to be that way - really , it did . true , the experiments sound really nasty ; but hey , that 's just how things were done in those days . really , it 's all okay , in the long run , because now , even though we still mus n't question the basic scientific premises regarding the necessity of animal research , at least we do n't have to perform those particular nasty experiments anymore ; and really - really - harlow was , in his own perverted way , something of a hero . even animal rights activists have cause to be thankful to him : because of him , we now have a convenient enemy to vilify , not to mention that desperately needed scientific proof positive that monkeys are more complex than we once believed , and hence deserve a little extra consideration . thank you , harry harlow . thank you , deborah blum , for puffing him back up again after the deflated view you left us with in the monkey wars . see people ? he really was n't such a bad guy after all . all you have to do is look at him in just the right way . . . .
