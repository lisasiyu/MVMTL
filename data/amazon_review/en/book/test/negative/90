an interesting , but dishonest and discouraging book & # 65279 ; in the end , it appears that by `` anti-catholic prejudice '' , jenkins means a failure to regard what he considers to be the core of the roman catholic church with sufficient reverence . he would probably characterize most of the practicing catholics i know as near-heretical . jenkins uses related but distinct words like `` bigotry '' and `` prejudice '' interchangeably . it is clear by the end that a great deal of what he is terming `` prejudice '' , which is usually applied to hostility from outsiders , is in fact internal dissent and dissatisfaction from current and former catholics . i refuse to be embarrassed on behalf of my society at large if the hierarchy of any organization is having problems keeping the flock in line . the book is quite interesting , containing a vast amount of information , including a lot which seems to argue against jenkin 's point . i do n't know whether to congratulate him to have the honesty to include it or to suppose that he has completely failed to understand how others might see it . jenkins is attempting to gain momentum from the various `` liberation '' movements that have arisen in the wake of the civil rights movement that became prominent in the 1950s . to this end , he employs the tried and true propaganda technique of beginning history at a point where one 's own side can be made to look like an injured innocent , i.e. , the anti-catholicism of nativists and know-nothings . if he really wants to trace the history of protestant/catholic conflict , he needs to go back to the reformation at least . it would also be appropriate to mention the vatican 's anti-americanism during the same period ; many churches were offended that americans considered the people , rather than god , to be the legitimate source of political power . in any case , it is irrelevant , since the book largely ignores the unfortunately still extant strains of real anti-catholic prejudice , such as the fundamentalist protestant groups who regard the pope as the anti-christ . jenkins 's real foe is people whose argument with the catholic church is not really religious but social . representatives of the church have often argued that it is their duty to enter into debates of public legislation and morality and i ca n't disapprove of the participation of any citizen in public debates . they all enter at the same level , however , and those who participate in the brawl of public debate ( excuse me , the marketplace of ideas ) must expect sometimes very harsh criticism , although i shall always hope , often in vain , for a level of civility and honest consideration of differing viewpoints . jenkins feels that the church should be accorded special reverence by all ; he seems to suggest that any criticism borders on bigotry . the church should be permitted to make strongly worded pronouncements without risking strongly worded retorts . to jenkins , any dispute between the church and any other group , including dissenting catholics , is proof of anti-catholic prejudice . he would probably deny this and attempts at several points to explain the difference between prejudice/bigotry and acceptable dissent , but the main difference seems to be that acceptable dissent is removed in time and place . jenkins mentions that the masons were originally welcoming to catholics , but after what he admits to be a campaign of slander and libel by the church hierarchs , became decidely less friendly . jenkins blames the masons for the ill-will , even though he admits that the church threw the first rhetorical punch . in many ways , jenkins does as much as any `` no-nothing '' to argue that `` real '' catholics are unable to live in a secular , multireligious society . it is in his discussion of homosexual issues that this becomes most clear . i share jenkins ' outrage at the invasion of st. patrick 's cathedral by act-up , but for the most part he discusses the incident as if the police refused their assistance and society at large applauded ; he does eventually admit that even many gay activists were appalled . i have enough sympathy for the points that jenkins raises about the problems of expecting rapid change with regard to a long-standing and widespread condemnation of homosexually that i would expect to be charged with homophobia . as an outsider , i would not presume to tell the church how to regard homosexuality or insist that they sanctify gay marriages . at the same time , if the church is going to condemn gays as hell-bound and attempt to frustrate their efforts to reach an accomodation with the larger society , it is ridiculous for him to take umbrage at non-violent complaints . jenkins completely misses the point in his discussion on pedophilia . the issue for most people is less that some priests are pedophiles than the apparent inability of the church to deal with the issue . people being what they are , this has presumably been an organizational problem for more than 1500 years , yet the church seems baffled . some people do see this as an opportunity to beat the church and its policy of celibacy over the head , but in fact civil authorities have in the past tried to spare the church embarrassment by declining to prosecute and trusting the church to deal with erring priests . jenkins ignores this and complains that the organizational strength of the church makes it a tempting target for grandstanding prosecutors , forgetting that this is the very reason that the problems were concealed for so long . the church is paying more for its own failure to deal with the problem than for the individual transgressions of certain priests
