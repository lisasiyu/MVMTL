eric , history is not supposed to be science fiction eric hobsbawm , dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of & quot ; scientific & quot ; marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history , wields the critic 's pen more like a butcher 's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes , a la don quixote , he is thrusting . so it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as hobsbawm 's sancho panza . as such i appeal to you , eric , not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian , for it is the most preposterous thing i have ever encountered . perhaps you were intrigued with the greeks ' romantic , albeit & quot ; unscientific , & quot ; appeal to the muse for inspiration ? how else can we , your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth , justice and the human way in the study of history , explain this unhistorical incantation ? have courage , though ! we know that your unwavering adherence to the & quot ; scientific & quot ; precepts of marxism will excuse everything . in short , eric , we know that you have been writing too much while watching star trek
