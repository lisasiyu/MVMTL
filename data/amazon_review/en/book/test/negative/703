hillariously nonsensical plagiarism the worst book ever written about the middle east is probably joan peters ' from time immemorial ; in this book alan dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from peters , he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so . the man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community 's leading delinquents and most prolific violators of international human rights law , international humanitarian law and un resolutions . his defending of nation states , however , is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable . joan peters ' book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by norman finkelstein , and even the most ardent of zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless . 20 years after that book faded into oblivion , alan dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own . for a full documentation of this plagiarism , see norman finkelstein 's personal website . by writing this book , dershowitz has inflicted more damage on israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could . any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy the case for israel really is ; both the book and the `case ' that dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies , bigoted arguments , idiocies , misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams .
