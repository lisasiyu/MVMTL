this book was almost physically painful to read unfortunately , i was forced to read this book by my photography professor . every word , every page , was sheer hell to struggle through . trying to follow barthe 's chaotic train of thought is next to impossible . this book is full of navel-gazing gibberish that can only loosely be described as `` english '' . he admits to not being a photographer , and goes on to claim photography itself does n't exist . how then , did he write a whole monstrous book on photography ? and moreover , why am i being subjected to it ? my heart is warmed somewhat when i read of mr. barthe 's history . he spent a lifetime suffering from tuberculosis , and ended it splattered across the front of a van . good . the bastard deserved it for what he 's inflicted on hapless undergrads around the world .
