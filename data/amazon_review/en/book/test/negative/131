introspective and longwinded view on suburban male angst ... i 've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late , and i thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading ford 's pulitzer prize winnning `` independence day '' . ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist frank 's life . frank 's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick . what you think of this book will depend on what you think of frank as a narrator . his desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times ; others will find this a profound truth in the book . i also found him to be longwinded and i had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character . slogged through this book and at the end , i do n't think it was worth it for me . 2 star
