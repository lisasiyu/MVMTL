why otters do n't make good pets the reason i do n't recommend this book , despite the nice writing and decriptions of the western highlands , is for one dark fact : a number of wild otters died for maxwell 's selfish pursuit of having a wild animal as a pet . this is not the story of a man who raises abandoned wild otters cubs in the western highlands and releases them but the story of a man who takes otters from the wild in iraq and africa and tries to raise them in scotland . what this story also tells us is that , if you are of a privillaged class , you can have any wild animal you want as your pet . today this is illegal `` pet '' trading and it is responsible for pushing certain species to the edge of extinction . i know that at the time this practice was not looked down upon as it is today and certain other nature writers ( durrell , heinrich ) engage in the same practice but with a more educated populus it should be clear : wild animals are not pets and they should stay wild
