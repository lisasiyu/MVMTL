disgusting the only book i 've ever read that i tore up and threw in the trash when i was finished . if this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there 's something seriously wrong with the world.this is a tragic , sad , grotesque , disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world . when a child is damaged it is never uplifting , whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes . this book is sickening . do n't buy it ! ! ! there are no animals only pain and death
