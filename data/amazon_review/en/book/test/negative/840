pathetic i bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane . not one of my better decisions . very wordy , and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it 's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in `` dragnet . '' we are talking zero development of characters . perhaps mr. woods feels he does n't need to give any depth to characters that he 's been writing about in previous books . well , he 's wrong . you basically just do n't care about these people . they are n't real , and they talk weird . not much action either , unless you count actions like : they got in the car ; they got in the boat ; they got in the plane . you get the picture . this is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money . do n't fall into his trap like i did . there are a lot better books out there .
