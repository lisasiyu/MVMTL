my first j. kellerman novel . i 'll try another one , but ... i 'm not a fan of psychologists as protagonists in mysteries and i 'm even less interested when they deal with children . children in peril is not entertaining . that said , however , i picked up `` rage '' at the airport . and thus , my first jonathan kellerman novel . this was a dumb story and far from believable . i could not suspend disbelief . if you read mysteries , the bad guy screams `` it 's me ! it 's me ! '' in the first 30 pages . i was hoping i was wrong , but unfortunately , that was not the case . so , i tagged along and watched alex and milo chase obvious red herrings , useless leads , eat some donuts , theorize and solve the mystery ! i can not mention how bad i thought the story was without giving away the plot , but let 's just say that the antagonists and their behavior is just not believeable over the course of so many years . i 'll try an earlier j. kellerman book . maybe it will be better
