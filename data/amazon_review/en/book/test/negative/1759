boring , boring , boring this was my first bertrice small book and i have to say i was not impressed . i did not care for the character at all . she was spoiled , and self rightous to everyone , including her family . i also thought the book was extremely boring . there was to much descrpition on small mundane things and not enough plot and action . it took me forever to get through this book and i am a very fast reader . this book made me not want to read any of her other books because i am afraid that they will be just as bad . i hope this was a one time oops for ms. small because this book was not good at all
