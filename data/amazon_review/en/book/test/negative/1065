sherri , reader with back and neck pain i got this book as a gift and i think after reading it '' only if it was that easy to forget about your pain ! '' i think the book tells us the strong link between the mind and pain but does n't offer anything new when it comes to solving the problem of pain through exercises which 99 % of todays experts say is the best solution to back or neck pain . invest in an updated book that tells you how to exercise anywhere
