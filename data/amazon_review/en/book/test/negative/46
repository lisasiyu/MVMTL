1st cd is great - better know italian from 2nd disc on or you 'll be lost ! ! ! this my first review on amazon but i was compelled to write based on my experience with this course . the first cd is fantastic . it starts off slow and gives you a solid foundation to build upon as you move from lesson to lesson . within a few weeks of driving back and forth to work i had mastered all the lessons on the cd and could easily translate the english phrases in the final review lesson into italian . i was confident and had a good grasp on building sentences and nuances such as how words changed when the subject was masculine or feminine . my opinion is that most people write their review based on the first cd . and then i put in the second cd . i thought there was some mistake , as if i had switched to a completely different italian course . the slow , clear speaking narrators were gone and replaced with fast talking italians who did n't repeat anything , and certainly did n't give you time to repeat in the pause . the assumption appeared to be that i already understood the language and this was merely a refresher course . within ten minutes i knew this was no longer the course for me . i listened to the entire second cd just in case this was all a joke and at some point they would slow down and actually help me learn italian . no such luck ! i have gone back to using the first cd for practice while i wait for the pimsleur italian course to arrive
