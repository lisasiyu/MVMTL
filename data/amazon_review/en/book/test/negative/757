great advice , but no follow through when i got this book , i could n't put it down . after reading it , i was anxious to get started on setting my goals as mr brown described in chapter 16 , but i hit a roadblock . mr. brown gives an example of the goal planner , but he did n't show how the math works to get the amount one should save each month . mr. brown even states , `` the following goal-setting forms will serve as a map in guiding you toward your desired financial goals . they are here to assist you in your planning . feel free to use the formula over and over again for your actual desires . '' one frustrating problem , mr. brown gives no formulas . i followed up by going to mr. brown 's company website and sending an e-mail explaining my frustration , i got a reply telling me to visit the website and click on `` need a financial plan . '' this requires me to enter in my credit card information and be charged $ 25 for mr. brown to preform the calculations for me ( the same calculations that should be outlined in chapter 16 ) . in addition , i get a free copy of a book that i just bought . what ? ! i bought this book expecting to be given the tools to be independent when setting up my goals . or at least to understand how calculations are made before i seek out professional help . but mr brown only brought me halfway when he suggests ways to set up goals and then in turn does n't fully explain them .
