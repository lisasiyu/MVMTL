disappointing collection of magazine and book quotes first off , there are 356 entries in this book , not 366 like the cover and title indicate . that huge and glaringly obvious mistake is representative of the lack of attention paid to the rest of the book . & quot ; everyday mind & quot ; is a disappointing collection of out-of-context excerpts from magazine articles and book snippets . there is not even one original entry in the whole book . the content is quite light for anyone really interested in buddhist thought , let alone anyone interested in really improving their lives . i wasted fifteen bucks on this one
