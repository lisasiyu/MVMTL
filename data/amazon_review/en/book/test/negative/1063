needs improvement i 'm not sure who wrote the positive reviews here , but i can tell you as a student using this book that it is among the worst i 've ever been stuck with and most of my classmates seem to agree . the concepts are made much more difficult than they should be by poor writing . the authors jump around constantly , use new terminology at times before introducing it , and provide examples that are inadequate in helping to solve the problems at the end of the chapter . stylistically , the writing is very bland and sure to put you to sleep . the first sentence of the book is `` this is a book about signals and systems . '' sure , this book may cover all of the core concepts involved in signal processing , but trying to make sense of it when you do n't already have a background in the subject is quite a challenge . after reading the chapters , we were unable to solve most of the problems in the book until given the answers were given to us . i 've dealt with bad textbooks before , but this one tops them all . needless to say , it was very frustrating experience and i ca n't say i recommend this book
