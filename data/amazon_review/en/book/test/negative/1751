unreadable this is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book . this book , in my opinion , is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders . a complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance . take time researching this book before you buy it because it 's the worst book i 've ever purchased .
