disappointing while this book makes some interesting points it comes across more as an anti-tradition propaganda piece than a useful treatise on martial arts . while the author is an experienced , highly knowledgeable practitioner , his understanding of the traditional martial arts that he rails against is incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate . do n't get me wrong ; i certainly do not believe that the author is an idiot . i believe that he is the victim of bad teaching , an all too common occurrence in martial arts . for example , he states that , `` today 's full-contact fighters throw devastating , lightning fast punches from a distance of less than two feet . against this kind of speed , classical blocks and punches simply do not stand a chance . what amazes me is how a flaw of this magnitude - and one that is taught to thousands of unknowing students every day - still exists in what are , otherwise , extremely potent arts ... '' this is just flat wrong . contrary to mr. orlando 's understanding , in classical blocks the hand that is out ( e.g . just punched or blocked ) performs the actual block , check , or deflection , while the hand that is in chamber executes a technique designed to control the opponent 's limb . even though it is often hidden , almost all blocks in traditional karate styles utilize this check/control methodology . in all cases , there is never ever any `` wind-up '' preceding anything . in most traditional schools all but the most junior students understand that simple fact . to delve deeper , the word `` uke '' translates more accurately to `` receive '' than it does to `` block . '' when viewed in this context , it may be easier to understand that practitioners typically check , deflect , or control an attack rather than meeting it force-on-force . using the traditional check/control methodology , a practitioner 's outstretched hand need only deflect an attack by a few inches to spoil its effect when contact is made close to an opponent 's body . in this fashion karateka can easily avoid being hit by even the most `` devastating '' of punches no matter how fast , or how powerfully , or even how unexpectedly they are thrown . common misconceptions such as this one are the reason that i believe it is imperative to supplement the traditional modeling approach to instruction with interactive discussions and other teaching styles . regardless , i hate to see this sort of stuff perpetuated ... now that i 've ripped him down , i will point out that there are some redeeming concepts in this book . for example , the author also promotes practicing martial arts in the same sort of attire one might be wearing in real life . if you have spent your whole life barefoot in a dojo , training with loose fitting clothes , you may well be in for a shock the first time you have to fight in tight-fitting jeans wearing boots . this is a very valid point . i wholeheartedly agree that practitioners should devote some of their training to more realistic conditions though that often must occur at their home rather than in a tradition karate school . all in all , however , there is not enough meat in this book for me to feel like i got my money 's worth from purchasing it . it was disappointing . get sifu orlando 's book `` indonesian fighting fundamentals : the brutal arts of the archipelago '' instead . it 's a great read and well worth buying . lawrence kane author of surviving armed assaults , the way of kata , and martial arts instructio
