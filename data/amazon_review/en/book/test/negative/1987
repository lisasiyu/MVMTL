avoid at all cost this is a horrible , horrible book . it does not deliver what readers have come to expect from a good romance novel . first , this novel is full of interesting history that the author does not describe in greater detail . she is a very poor historian and should concentrate more on the romantic part of the plot . all she does is confuse the reader with her vaguely described historical events . second , the male protagonist is mostly unpleasant and often cruel . very rarely do we see a soft spot in his heart for the heroine . i was really hoping that there would be a major confession of the & quot ; hero 's & quot ; love for the heroine at the end of the story , especially after the way he treats her throughout the book . but no . he never even says the 3 little words we have come to expect at the end ( at least ) of a good romance novel . we are just supposed to assume he loves her . very unfulfilling ! third , there are numerous loose ends at the end of the novel . definitely a book to avoid at all costs
