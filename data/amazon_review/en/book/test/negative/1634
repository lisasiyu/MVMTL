multilevel marketing meets education i had to purchase this book for a community college class i 'm taking . as a `` textbook , '' it has been a complete disappointment . the `` science '' is sketchy , the research is shoddy , and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like `` you ca n't prove nearly anything empirically in education '' ( straight from page 8 ! ) . some of the concepts presented are interesting , but since mr. jensen ( no , he does n't hold a doctorate ) provides almost no citations for his claims , there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from . the book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch . in fact , you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting `` certified '' in mr. jensen 's unique , `` empirically unproven '' techniques
