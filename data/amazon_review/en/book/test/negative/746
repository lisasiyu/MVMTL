another prophetic disappointment in `` epicenter '' joel rosenberg provides the background information that drives his novels about the middle east and the end times . this nonfiction book will grab readers ' attention due to its analysis of current events through the lenses of politics and economics . however , rosenberg insists that a third lens of biblical prophecy is necessary in order to truly understand what is happening in the middle east today . but is rosenberg 's third lens properly focused ? has he understood ezekiel 's prophecies correctly ? it should first be recognized that rosenberg 's approach to biblical prophecy is nothing new ; he follows the general outline of end time events that have been taught for years by dispensational premillennialists . all the bible scholars that he relies upon fall within that school of prophetic interpretation . they include c.i . scofield , john walvoord , and hal lindsey . he refers to tim lahaye as `` arguably the world 's preeminent prophecy expert '' ( p. 288 ) . during the thirty-seven years since my conversion and the twenty-eight years in which i have pastored an evangelical christian church , i have studied both the biblical prophecies and the modern-day prophecy teachers . at the beginning of my christian life i was convinced that the prophecy teachers had the future figured out , but i have learned over time that they are less than reliable . for example , lindsey suggested in `` the late great planet earth '' that christ would return in 1988 . in the first edition of `` the beginning of the end , '' lahaye said that world war i was the first sign of the end times , but in the 1991 revision of the book he changed that first sign to the founding of the modern nation of israel in 1948 . so i approached rosenberg 's book with caution . `` epicenter '' gives the impression that ezekiel 38 and 39 are easy to understand . rosenberg does not mention that evangelical scholars disagree . peter craigie says , `` the series of prophecies concerning gog . . . are among the most difficult parts of the entire book of ezekiel to interpret . '' even dispensational premillennialists can not agree on when ezekiel 38 and 39 are going to be fulfilled . will it be before , during , or after the tribulation ? or will it be after the millennium ? advocates for each position can be found . rosenberg also skips over what ezekiel 37 meant to ezekiel 's contemporaries . since they were living in exile in babylon when ezekiel delivered his prophecies , would n't they naturally have thought that the divine promise of return to the land referred to them ? but rosenberg does n't even mention that possibility . instead he takes a hermeneutical leap and immediately applies the prophecy to modern israel 's founding in 1948 . the biggest error comes from rosenberg 's reliance upon a nineteenth century scholar 's teaching that in ezekiel 38:3 `` rosh '' refers to russia ( pp . 85-86 ) . even dispensational premillennialists like charles dyer and ralph alexander reject that interpretation . what about `` meshech '' and `` tubal '' ? in his novels rosenberg readily identifies them as moscow and tobolosk , but in `` epicenter '' he briefly mentions that questions have been raised about those identifications . scholars today understand those terms to be names of tribes that lived in the area of modern-day turkey . why does rosenberg prefer outdated scholarship ? it 's worth noting how the author deals with the other nations mentioned in ezekiel 38 . by the amount of emphasis he places on events in persia ( or modern iran ) , he implies that it will be the major ally of russia in its attack on israel . but is that suggestion derived from the text itself , or is that an interpretation rosenberg imposes on the text in light of current events ? ezekiel himself does not highlight persia any more than cush or put . rosenberg points out that egypt is not mentioned in ezekiel 38 as an ally of russia ( p. 132 ) . that , he suggests , is evidence of ezekiel 's remarkable accuracy since egypt currently has a peace treaty with israel . but in 1970 hal lindsey identified egypt as a key member of russia 's ally called `` the king of the south '' in daniel 11 . how can two prophecy experts come to such contradictory conclusions ? paul boyer observed in his excellent book , `` when time shall be no more . '' `` while the core structure of the premillennial scenario remained remarkably stable for 150 years , new events were continually elevated to the status of `prophetic fulfillments ' or `end-time signs ' while individuals or events that failed to live up to their expected role were quietly dropped . . . the historian , reading hundreds of prophecy books published over a two-hundred-year period , can readily see this process of inserting current events into an archaic belief system . the average believer , encountering the genre for the first time , may be stunned by the uncanny contemporaneity of the prophecies . '' timothy weber likewise writes in `` living in the shadow of the second coming , '' `` in retrospect , premillennialists had shown more enthusiasm than accuracy in their interpretations . . . their leaders were confident that biblical prophecy was being fulfilled , but events kept forcing them to reevaluate their interpretations of how it was being fulfilled . one is struck by how forgiving and forgetful the premillennialist rank and file must have been during this period . they stuck by their leaders even when they misread the signs of the times . the leaders themselves seemed little deterred by their mistakes . events were changing so quickly that they had little time for apologies . '' while `` epicenter '' may become a bestseller , i 'm afraid that it will eventually prove to be just another prophetic disappointment .
