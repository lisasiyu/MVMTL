you should probably look elsewhere i found this book to be weird quiet frankly . chapter 2 goes off the deep-end of designing efficient queries before you 've even built a report yet . that material should have been put at the end of the book . creating a report with the report wizard is covered in chapter 4 but probably would have been best if it was before chapter 3 which covers creating a report manually . i did n't find anything `` pro '' , as the name implies , or advanced with the book . it 's a broad introductory text only . also , it only covers using the reportviewer control for win forms and not the one web forms . the two are similar enough but coverage of both would have been better .
