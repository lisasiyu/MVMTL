very weak entry in the series like many others , i 'm a big fan of the ladies no . 1 detective agency series , but this is a really poor entry that barely even bothers to go through the motions . first of all , mma ramotswe has only one case to deal with , a wealthy woman who wants her four suitors checked out to eliminate any golddiggers . the first two she checks out are interesting enough , a bible-thumper seeking to reform bar girls , and a slick radio dj . but smith does n't even get around to the other two , and wraps up that storyline in a very abrupt way . another plotline revolves around mr. j.l.b . matakoni and a dishonest competitor garage , but this is small potatoes that does n't really amount to much . a third plotline involves mr. j.l.b . matakoni 's getting dragooned into a parachute jump to raise money for the orphanage , again , does n't amount to much . the last major plotline concerns the marriage between mma ramotswe and mr. j.l.b . matakoni -- or rather , the lack thereof . the resolution to this is completely anti-climatic and does n't do justice to the event . one might forgive the weak plotting if there was some really juicy character development , but there is n't . even worse , some major characters almost totally disappear : mma makutsi has very little role , and the two orphan children adopted by mr. j.l.b . matakoni appear only once or twice . the book 's got the same warmth and humor as the rest of the series , but it 's all sort of perfunctory . one does n't get nearly the same feel for the country and people . the overall is like looking forward to a weekend visit with old friends , only to find them totally distracted and distant . big bummer of a book .
