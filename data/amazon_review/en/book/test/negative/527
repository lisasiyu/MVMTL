one of the very worst ! this is one of the worst ( maybe the worst ) books i have ever read . the actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book . the rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing . the author and the publisher are insulting the intelligence of readers by publishing such a stupid book . the technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in technical analysis ( ta ) . in the ta terminology , it is called support and resistance levels . if you are interested in this technique , use one of the books on ta . those books cover it in much more rigor than darvas ' book and they cover a lot more ta techniques that are much more powerful . my favorite book on ta is `` how technical analysis works '' by bruce kamich . husam abu-haimed , ph.d .
