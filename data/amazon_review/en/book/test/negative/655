not recommended having read ( and thoroughly enjoyed ) levitt 's freakonomics , i picked up `` hidden order : the economics of everyday life '' looking for more of the same . unfortunately , i was sadly disappointed . i get the impression the author intended to write a freakonomics-type book , but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material ( located at the end of the book ) . facing an irate publisher , he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old economics lecture notes . as a result , readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive , while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use . ( despite the glowing accolades on the cover , the author 's explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook . ) the author also posits end-of-chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon , but does not provide any answers . aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students , such tactics are unconscionable . of course , the author may be priming the pump for sales of a `` hidden order supplement '' . a final negative point is the author 's tone , which is frequently condescending towards the reader ( e.g . telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory , so it will not even be presented ) . while this may be true for a layperson reading the book , being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter . overall , if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library , the last 40 pages are worth reading . otherwise , save your time and money . reviewer 's background : b.sc . ( computing science & mathematics ) m.b.a. ( finance & marketing ) ph.d. ( finance )
