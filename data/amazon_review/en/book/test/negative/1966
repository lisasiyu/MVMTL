awful book this is a how to book on taking a great subject and destroying it . marc eliot writes like a reporter for the national enquirer or any other of the numerous tattle sheets at the grocery store checkout . my daughter bought me this book for my birthday because she knew i like jimmy stewart . i read it but almost wish i had not . it is trash and a waste of time
