save your money if you are a programmer and in a hurry to implement your own graphics filter then do n't buy this book . its treament of the various formats is essentially devoid of any examples and detail . a very superficial book with large fonts a & quot ; buttons & quot ; fulfilling the need to ensure bulk to the book at the expense of content . there is no cd with example coding and decoding examples , very very few tables of giving a graphical view of the file structures . in short it is a poorly presented and poorly written book ... hardly worth $ 10 rather than the $ 25 they are asking ... .go by the o'reilly book encyclopaedia of graphics formats ... expensive for sure but it has what this book lacks and that is content
