from christianity ... to 'churchianity' the author comes off as a whining , unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling ' church environment ; further apalled by the church founder 's belief , in that it ( the worlwide church of god ) was god 's true church through the ages , right on up to the present 'end time ' . feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on herbert w. armstrong , the church 's actual teachings , and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole , labeling it a 'cult ' ... and further damning its pastor general as a `` heretic '' , despite the church 's humanitarian works , publishing , colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of h.w . armstrong . since armstrong 's death in 1986 , feazell and his cohort joseph tkach jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains , and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic holy days , sabbaths , ten commandments ( which , in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions ' ) and general lifestyle of this 7th day church of god denomination . mr. feazell apparently does not speak for all the church membership , as over 100,000 members left and formed various smaller independent church of god conferences throughout the united states ... and continuing the legacy and apostolic , traditional christian system of worship restored by herbert w. armstrong in 1927 . recommended reading : `` autobiography of herbert w. armstrong '' ; `` mystery of the ages '' ; `` the incredible human potential ''
