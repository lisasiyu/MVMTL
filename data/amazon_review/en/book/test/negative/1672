the westing game i am reading the book `` the westing game '' and i say that this book absolutely awful . the book has very little details , and the plot is oh , so boring , and i never like this before . the characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as `` crow '' , `` turtle ' , and `` uncle sam '' . the scenery is bad , and i could imagine better places . the ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever . i would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again . the book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror . i think the author had a huge writers block , and wrote down what ever she could think of first . i do n't now how , but newbery award . i would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how i really think of this book . my summary is that this book is extremely terrible , and should be destroyed .
