the crowning achievement of ( post ) modern french philosophy that this book is receiving one star , given the title of my review , should surprise no one . look , say what you will ; i am a classically trained , analytic , anglophone philosopher with a penchant for clarity and rigor . that is where i stand . if you are looking for a text which purports to be theoretical , and yet is obviously densely literary and aphoristic , perhaps i do n't understand what you 're on about , and perhaps you do n't either . this book is neither clear nor rigorous . where it does n't mutate truly elementary understandings of science ( not to say that either deleuze understands what the difference between science and pseudoscience is ) , psychology , and economics to suit its incoherent purposes , it avoids any understanding whatsoever . the philosophical work contained herein is non-starting . that is , it is not philosophy , as it is neither argumentative , interpretive , nor logical . there are no discernible conclusions ( which is not to say that there are none in this pig latin dog 's dinner , but they probably are n't deduced from premisses ) where there is anything like 'argument ' at all . to say that i 'm missing the point , you 'd first have to show that such work can have a point . that it violates hard-won conventions of philosophical discourse , which are taken as primitive ( i ca n't tell you how many times the law of excluded middle was violated ) , is not a victory for this work . it is a setback . that it has not been translated into english , but rather some retarded cousin of english , is perhaps partly to blame for my lack of understanding . i tend only to be able to read natural languages . but then , again , perhaps my rhizomatic foreshortening ( to wit : to shorten is also to lengthen ) is in part quasiculpable ( that is , retrodogmatically ) as a blamematic ( viz . contraposto ) which tends inter alia to produce ( and re-produce , as malreaux reads sartre in referential milieus of darwinian technologies of traffic control ) my congnitive disfunctionabilities . i recommend the work of w.v.o . quine if you 're looking for a 'philosophy of our time , ' as one reviewer suggested we must
