why does updike ignore women artists ? i find it disturbing that john updike can apparently find no female artist worthy of mention in his book ... beyond one artist who is practically unknown . and she is included only because his family owned a piece of artwork created by her . updike seems very dismissive of even this one female contributor . he does find room in his book to include a nude photo of the great artist georgia o'keefe , but no actual artwork created by o'keeffe . that should give you a clue what the rest of the book is like . disturbing , too , are updike 's dismissive comments about edward hopper ; he claims that edward hopper ca n't paint faces very well . so even though i purchased this book , i do n't recommend it to others . give this one a pass .
