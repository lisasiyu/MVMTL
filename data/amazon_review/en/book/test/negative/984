typical robert smith mush this book is pretty lame compared to other texts on the market today . the yi jin jing description is terrible and of no use what so ever . neither is the shaolin 5 animals forms that are discribed in minute proportions . i do n't care what the history of the manuscripts are , this book offers no definitive information . it is very vague and elementary , a lot like smith 's other books . the fighting methods shown are a poor representation of shaolin skills . the true essence of shaolin is beyond any manuscript , let alone a hoax manuscrpit from taiwan , which is the inspiration for this book
