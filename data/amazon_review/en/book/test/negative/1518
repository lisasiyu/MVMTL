dated , not much good info i bought this book for ideas and best practices . i work in retail design . the quality of the printing of the book was not very good ; photos did n't give much of a sense of scale , materials used . and the examples seemed very dated to me . if you are a retail design professional , you are better off heading to a local mall , taking some notes and pics yourself
