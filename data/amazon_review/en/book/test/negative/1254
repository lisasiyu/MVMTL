as if by magic ! daniel dennett 's excellent book consciousness explained extracts a very funny cartoon from scientific american , in which two professors stare at a blackboard showing a formula full of complex algebra . in the middle of the formula appears the sentence , `` then a miracle occurs '' . one professor points to the statement and says to the other , `` i think you should be more explicit here in step two . '' roger penrose is n't just any old boffin : he is the emeritus rouse ball professor of mathematics at oxford university and has been knighted for his services to science . the emperor 's new mind is his attempt to crack that perennial philosophical chestnut , the consciousness/artificial intelligence problem . penrose 's view is that strong ai is simply wrong and that a computer could never replicate ( functionally or actually ) what we know as `` consciousness '' . right . take a deep breath here . for it 's a scary thing for a mere mortal ( with a decidedly ordinary bachelor 's degree in the humanities ) to say something like this about the one of the cleverest men on the planet , but i ca n't see any way around it : in this book roger penrose completely , totally , misses the point . insofar as it 's considered an entry on the consciousness/ai debate , the emperor 's new mind - all 583 pages of it - is all but worthless . there . i said it . then again , nearly 500 of those pages do n't even purport to be about consciousness , so perhaps all is not lost . instead , they contain an extremely dense , at times fascinating , but uniformly ( and i use the word deliberately ) dazzling overview of the more esoteric parts of modern mathematics , physics and cosmology . while penrose thinks it is necessary background , it is n't - it amounts to an extremely long winded appeal to authority : one is left with the firm impression that the rouse ball professor of mathematics at oxford university is a very , very smart chap , and that one really ought to see that what ever he says goes . this is no small irony , given the title of his book . for if anyone is holding himself out as being a tailor purveying a cloth that only the cleverest people can see , it 's roger penrose . here 's where i think he goes wrong . firstly , his attempt to undermine the ai position is founded on purely mathematical reasoning . pure mathematics is a closed logical system . its truths are n't falsifiable , so by themselves have no explanatory force . mathematical statements ( such as `` 1+1=2 '' ) are necessarily true for all time and all universes so , ipso facto , they ca n't - by themselves - tell us anything about any particular universe . yet that is just what penrose asks them to do . he invokes gödel 's theorem of undecidability , perhaps to counter the argument i have just made , but it is n't convincing - being logically unable to prove all truths in a particular set ( even though you know they are true ) is very different from being able to falsify them . without that power , you have no explanatory traction in the outside world . penrose 's entire attack on strong ai is based on an unfalsifiable , and therefore non-content carrying , argument . another error is to assume an algorithm must have been designed for the purpose for which it is used , and must work perfectly to be of any use . natural selection illustrates that this is simply not the case . an algorithm may have a number of useful unintended by-products , and an algorithm can be extremely useful even when we know it to be completely misconceived at every level : take newtonian mechanics as a good example . we 've known for a century it is n't correct but in most practical circumstances it works fine . which brings me to my next point : for all the learning penrose includes on mandelbrot sets , phase space , entropy and hawking radiation , the emperor 's new mind is conspicuous for what it leaves out : the bibliography contains no reference to karl popper nor the general philosophy of science - which might have helped him on the issue of falsifiability - nor crucially to a number of writers who have been very influential on the modern mind/ai question : daniel dennett is barely mentioned ( dennett 's writing probably represents the `` forefront '' of the consciousness debate ) , nor is richard dawkins well-referenced , despite having written compellingly ( and , being a zoologist , with a great deal more expertise ) on the question of algorithms in natural selection . indeed , penrose does n't clearly present the arguments of any particular supporter of strong ai , but rather chooses to generalise loosely as if he is convinced his mathematical deductions can carry the day , and that ai does n't present a significant challenge . douglas hofstadter is given a little space , and john searle and his largely discredited chinese room experiment a fair space , but other than that the only philosopher penrose seems to be aware of is plato . another thinker penrose does n't seem familiar with is william of occam . instead of doing some background reading ( and applying a little common sense ) , penrose has launched a theory which ( as he proudly proclaims ) takes us to the ends of time and the universe and back to the smallest subatomic particles to explain ( in ways he freely admits he does n't understand ) an everyday , prosaic ( but still extremely hard to grasp ) phenomenon . in its interstellar journey penrose 's theory drifts very close to dualism , and close ( but not quite so close , perhaps ) to positing ( or needing ) some sort of god to work . that will give succour in some quarters , but not the ones penrose has in mind , i suspect . occam 's razor would require that such untestable and speculative suppositions be rejected unless no other explanation is available . penrose would protest there are none ; dennett , dawkins , hofstadter and their colleagues and adherents ( including me ) would beg to differ , and point to a lot of literature that penrose has n't read . in any case one would think that penrose 's own intuition ( which he claims helps him to see truth despite gödel undecidability ! ) ought to help him see his theory is , as jeremy bentham would say , `` nonsense on stilts '' . ultimately , when penrose says `` quantum theory explains consciousness '' he is really saying no more than `` something magic happens ! '' or even `` then a miracle occurs '' . mr penrose , i think you should be more explicit here in step two . olly buxton
