way too boring and confusing - could n't finish it i have been trying to read this book for over a year . i ca n't get into it and i think it 's time to throw in the towel . i have gotten half-way through but the author jumps around too much . the stories are interesting but do n't really seem to have anything to do with one another . too many characters - could use a cast of characters or map showing how characters are related at the beginning . the upside is that the individual stories are well written and it addresses some interesting topics .
