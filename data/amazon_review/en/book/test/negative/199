bad one this book was awful . the author is a bad writer in general . also , as you can tell from her scary emaciated grin on the back of the book , she is not recovered . this means that she can not distance herself from her disorders and therefore ca n't really write about them well . there is a tinge of smugness in her account , like , `` look how thin i am , i just ca n't eat . '' it 's boring and it 's about a really lame person ... she is incapable of living her life at all . she still lived with her parents for the majority of her life
