i would look elsewhere this book was a new choice from our professor who was teaching our mechanism design class . in my opinion , the three authors who wrote it each took a section and slapped their parts together . totally different writing style as you go throught the book . in addition t is a small book and you constanlty are turning pages to makes references to figures which makes it hard to read with good flw . n addition a lot of the diagrams are unclear and dont necessarily say what they represent . our professor ended up hating the book himself . a good reference maybe but not for the beginner
