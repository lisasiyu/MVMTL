damage control for the current president i found this book to be based on a kernel of truth wrapped in innumerable layers of unconfirmable speculation ( how many people really have access to intelligence agency archives ? ) and one-sided 'analysis ' . it is clear the bin ladin was 'lost ' at tora bora when our troops were called back to garrison , allowing him to escape . this goes even farther to the right than micheal moore goes to the left . if you want a look at the subject from someone who was involved through several administrations , read `` against all enemies : inside america 's war on terror '' by richard clarke . if you buy this book , you are paying for propaganda
