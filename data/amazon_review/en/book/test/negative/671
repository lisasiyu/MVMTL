i think ms. hazzard owes me an apology . the only reason i finished `` the transit of venus '' was the hope of any improvement . this book took away two hours of my life-two hours that i can never earn back by reading true literature . the story ( is there a story ? ) is dreadful . the sentence structures , the paragraph performances , the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if ms. hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights . i will never recommend this book to any audience . ms. hazzard and her publisher should refund my money
