over blown like it or not , i sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities . thomas pynchon is one of those . if the crying of lot 49 is his best work , or exemplary of his work , as so many say it is , then perhaps he really should find a day job , to use the cliche . lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature . it 's what happens when you take out plot , character , and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling . i am very well aware that , pynchon , like so many other authors of his era , are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless . the problem is , he is not looking hard enough to find it . he is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading . my answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century . the problem is , you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life , and this book simply tells you that those do n't exist . finally , the content of the book often seems pointless , and the writing is weak . there is no forward motion , and nothing to interest a decent reader
