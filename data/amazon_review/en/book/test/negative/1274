a very mediocre tour of the arab world i found this book to be a real disappointment . for starters , lamb is a journalist rather than a scholar . nothing wrong with that , except for the fact that much of the book reads like a `` travelogue '' based on anecdotes and personal encounters rather than a serious analysis of the arab world . he certainly does not have the historical perspective or depth of knowledge of a true middle east expert such as bernard lewis . this book might be somewhat informative to those just beginning to learn about the arab world . but certainly there must be better `` beginner '' books out there . lamb also appears to have a very limited knowledge of factual information about the region , especially historical facts , as demonstrated by the substantial number of errors in the book . for example , he describes ancient egypt and mesopotamia as being arab accomplishments . but these civilizations did n't consider themselves to be arabs and certainly did n't speak the arabic language , which lamb himself later describes as the best criteria for determining who is arab and who is not . the truth is that the arabs were largely confined to the arabian peninsula until muhammad , in the early 600 's , united the arab tribes under islam and began the wars of conquest which were to eventually bring the arabic language to what is now considered to be the arab world , including egypt and iraq . finally , the original edition of this book was written in 1987 . the 2002 edition has been partially updated . but much of the book is still outdated . for instance , his writings on the political violence that wrecked lebanon in the 1980 's . the arab world is a fascinating place . please do it justice by finding a better book .
