they know their stuff ... but the book could have been much better the material is fine . they cover most of the basics . however , i found the book to be extremely repetitious . they would often say the same thing over and over , page after page . it was comical really . the book could easily have been edited down to half its size . the construction of the book lacked any organization at all . i got the feeling that the many topics in it were written at different times and slapped together when it was time to put it together for publishing . you could just as easily read it from back to front because there really is no flow to the book . i also had a problem with this abraham thing . it was kind of a turnoff really . i understand it 's a nice marketing angle , but enough already . i hope no one out there really believes that this info came from some supernatural entity . it 's too bad , really ; the writers seem knowledgable enough to have written on this subject without the need for a gimmick .
