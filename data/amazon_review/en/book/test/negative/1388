a very tough read . as the title suggests , this is a book about improving your speed . it is a general book applicable to any sport . and so the authors go to great lengths to generalize their program . i expected to read about the latest in exercise physiology concerning speed , recommended training , and exercises . we do get that sort of thing in a manner of speaking , but to put it very bluntly , this book is one of the most jumbled , mixed up , illogical presentations you are likely to read . hard to believe three college graduates put this together . in order to get anything out of this book you kind of have to trudge all the way through it and improvise your thought process as you go . the authors give absolutely zero help . do we get titles to the latest studies on sport speed -- in the negative . do we get information on the latest persons doing research on the subject -- in the negative . do we get a logical , understandable training program -- in the negative . what we get instead is kind of a hodge podge of information coming from all directions without hardly any logical organized presentation . oh -- there is the seven step speed training program presented in 7 different chapters . and to give credit -- it does look like this is a good speed improvement program . however the information the seven chapters ( and you have to get through 3 almost imconprehensible chapters to get to the program ) seems to rain down from the sky in a very disconnected fashion . there are few explanations of the whys and wherefores ; there are zero explanations on where the program comes from or how it was put together , or where it fits in anywhere in what is being done by any one . it is just there , presented , and i suppose we are supposed to swallow it all on faith . there are presented many descriptions and photographs of useful looking exercises . i do know more about speed improvement after reading the book . but the information was gotten by pulling teeth
