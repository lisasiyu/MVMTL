slapped together - dry and boring the previous post says nothing about the quality of this book and thus should be considered a definition of the xaml technology rather than a review . in my opinion this book seemed slapped together . it was as if the tech writer of the documentation paraphrased the ms xaml help . there was very little usage of metaphor or humour to make the topic interesting or easier to understand . the code examples are extremely simple and unimaginative . in one of the very few lame attempts at humour the author comments about an animated rotating square and states that , `` it may not be very useful , but it sure is fun to watch . '' i found this attempt at humour insulting . can you imagine having a conversation with someone who talked like this ? if you are like me and you really like to have a paper version of bleeding edge tech stuff , you can be can be forgiven for purchasing this drivel . if you want to save yourself some hard earned cash , just download the ms expression interactive designer ctp and work through the examples . you will learn more doing this in less time . in fact , unless you are stuck on the bus , you are wasting your time with this book .
