disappointed with this book i have read all of patricia cornwell books and love them all . except this one . i just liked it . it was okay . not what i 've come to expect from one of my favorite authors . i was excited to see that there were new characters and i did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them . however the whole story did not develop very well , and it left me feeling like i missed a whole bunch of the 'potential ' story . i ended the book feeling like ms. cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story . very disappointed .
