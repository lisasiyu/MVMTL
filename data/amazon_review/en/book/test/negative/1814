encyclopedia of spelling errors ... you can read some of the other reviews to get an idea of some of the specific errors ... the book is loaded with them from wrong moves to other typos ... how can this book help anyone if half the battle is trying to figure out whats going on ... he has quotes from people in years that they already were dead ... games with wrong year and people listed ... sad that they still publish books from this author ... i do not understand why they let books out with so many errors ... when i buy a chess book i expect it to have almost no errors ... this book has more errors than actual things that help players ... if you give this to someone and tell them to find all the errors ... they woudl probably have grandkids and still not find them all ... i dunno what he means by golden nuggets ... i think more work went into thinking of name of book than content ... books like this give chess books a bad name to say very least ... if you want a book on chess strategy try watson 's advances since nimzo ... even the mammoth book of chess will help you more than this item ... perhaps even consider silman 's strategy grandmaster techniques from a to z book . hopefully one of those books might help you in your game and give you value for your dollar..
