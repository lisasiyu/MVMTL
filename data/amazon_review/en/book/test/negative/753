slim book the reading was okay , but there was n't much meat to it . each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story . only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located . one of the most interesting pages told about how disney bought up all of the fl property using fictitious companies . for the price , i was disappointed as most of it is not notable . if you 're a disney buff , get this from the library and save the $ $ $ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting
