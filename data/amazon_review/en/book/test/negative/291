good for stupid people . this is a wonderful book for those kids who either have parents paying off all their teachers to pass them or the students that sleep with the right people to pass . oh , and i do n't sit in my room on saturdays playing card games , either . but having fun does n't mean `` get drunk 24/7 for four years '' . there 's something called having a life that this book totally misses but , well , it 's for college kids , and they 're mostly idiots
