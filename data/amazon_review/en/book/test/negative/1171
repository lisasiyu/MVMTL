disappointing sequel i 've loved jeanne ray 's other books ( julie & romeo , step ball change , and eat cake ) . i found them all to be well written , funny and entertaining reads , with varied and likeable characters . this book does n't come close to meeting the standard set by the others . it is n't funny at all . all of the characters act horribly , including the martyred julie who lets everyone in her family walk all over her . i have n't read a book in a long time where i did n't like a single character . ( and i liked these people in the first book - julie and romeo ) . i highly recommend her other books , but i 'd stay away from this one
