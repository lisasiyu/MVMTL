not bad , but neither good it is pretty general , there is no such thing as advice or anything the like about practices.he insists in almost every chapter that the mission is the most important thing.the only intersting ideas in his book are some about leadership , but i felt very much that i already knew them , he only confirmed them.this is not to say i am a genius.i am 18 , so i guess if you are involved in running a nonprofit for more than one year , you would be able to write a better book . for a beginner it might be intersting to get it from the library , and read it in a train or so . not bad , but getting a book on leadership , and other one on marketing is a much better idea
