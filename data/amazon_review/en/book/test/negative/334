pass if you 're new to the postmodernism question , then this book is n't for you . better to start someplace else . and if you been looking at postmodernism for a while now , you 've probably already read other , more extensive works by the authors of this volume , so you do n't need to read this book either . so basically , there 's no good reason to read this book . and if you were going to read it , you would have a hard time because of the way its laid out design-wise . being postmodern and all , zondervan tried to design the inside of this book as `` with-it '' as they could . unfortunately , while i enjoy postmodern book covers , when that same style is applied to the insides of a book it can make for some very tedious reading . much of the text is printed as a light shade of gray using an italic font , which , as any graphic designer reading this review will tell you , is a big no-no . it just makes for hard reading . oh , and future editions of this work should edit out fredica mathewes-green 's attemps at humorous commentary throughout horton 's piece . cheers
