tedious the subtitle of this book , the lives and films of akira kurosawa , is completely deceitful . there is nothing biographical in this book about either one of its main protagonists . it is rather a chronicle of the japanese film industry , not without interest in itself . however , the voluminous facts , tid-bits of information about every minor actor , director , script-writer , and film composer , as well as the synopsis of every film mentioned , makes for increbibly tedious reading . while the book has its merit as a source of information , not much credit should be given to the author other than for his ability to put together facts that are available from a number of sources . meanwhile , reading all these capsules of data will leave you dry when it comes to the lives of kurosawa and mifune . the author tells us nothing about how they lived , felt , thought , behaved , what motivated them ; probably because he does n't know himself . a simple gathering of public facts , none researched by the author himself because their sources are many and widely available , especially on the internet , do not make for a worthy book
