not the best~ eniz i thought that this book was o.k . for the most part , but i really did n't like some parts at all . what really gave the book a bad effect was what lavaughn finds out about jody . i think that kind of ruins the book . i was very sure that she was going to talk to jody , or something , but after she finds out the true thing behind him , i think it was a total waste of writing . i do n't really reccommend this book to anyone , it had a nice writing style , but the actual writing was n't that great
