waste of money i bought this book based upon some of the other reviews that said it was great and they could n't have been more wrong . i needed the book on short notice so it cost me $ 25 and it was absolutely useless . there is nothing useful in this book at all . i ended up just winging the toast because i did n't have time to look for another book
