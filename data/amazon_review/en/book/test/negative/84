as insightful as `` real men do n't eat quiche , '' but without the humor in `` iron john , '' robert bly announces that american men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness . he illustrates his point with one of the brothers grimm 's more obscure ( and frankly less interesting ) stories , interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point . he also draws heavily on freudian and jungian theories . he proves his point in the same way freud and jung proved theirs ' i.e . by saying `` this is what i see , i am the expert , so that makes it true , occham 's razor be darned . '' bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions , nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or , heaven forbid , that his observations might be wrong . for example , bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 ( conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion , despite his objective tone ) . bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true . he does not consider that by age 35 , most men have realized that they do n't really want to be firemen . could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to ( such as self-help books ) ? naw , it 's got ta be that `` dreams '' thing . bly also describes a case where students during the viet nam war broke into their college presidents ' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the cia . bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures , because their fathers left home to work , preventing their sons from seeing how men work . bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger . no , there had to be a `` real '' reason for the break-in , and are n't we lucky to have robert bly to tell us what it is ? along the way , bly overloads his writing with literary references , all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes . it 's all very pretentious , er uh , interesting , but so what ? i could interpret the same passages to mean something else . if i lived at the time the passages were written , my interpretation would most likely be very different , despite bly 's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal . bly ' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down , however . it underscores what is wrong with his whole premise . he tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact , but uses only subjective views ( many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context ) to support the idea . sorry bob , you ca n't have it both ways . one gets the impression that `` iron john '' was cynically written to fill a niche . like all self-help books , `` iron john '' targets a specific audience , tells them they are not happy , and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy . bly 's target audience is white men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements . if you do not need a political movement to define who you are , then `` iron john '' is not for you
