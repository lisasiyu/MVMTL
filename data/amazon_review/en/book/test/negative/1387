the cover is very misleading . the cover is interesting , the description on the back makes it seem amazing ! and when i read about 20 pages of the book , i 'm in total shock . this is not the book that i had in mind . first of all , this is the ! most ! unrealistic thing i have ever read . as hard as i tried , i could not get into the story . the language is very .. let me say this : it 's complex poetry written in the simplicity for a five year old .
