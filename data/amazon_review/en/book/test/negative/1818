verbosity should be verboten i am really impressed with the good ratings this book has gotten so far . i hate it . the authors incapability to explain the multinational context in simple terms , his approach to pack every little , tiny detail that somehow might correlate to the overall subject into each chapter , and his inability to use formulas and graphs in an understandable way , makes me wonder if the author actually knows what he is talking about . i find this financial book the worst i had to deal with so far . as an honor student with a finance major i feel like shapiro is trying to hard to create a book that covers all . his examples and illustrations are somewhat interesting since they provide some information on how things work in the real world , but they lack something really important that i personally find essential for demonstration purposes : clarity and comprehensiveness . additionally , i find his approach to verbally describe his calculations in huge paragraphs disturbing . as disturbing is his way to create his own symbols and acronyms and not using those other financial books use . when studying you therefore need so much time in figuring out , what his symbols actually mean , that you would rather read another book . i personally doubt that shapiro has actually understood the subject himself . he is using the trick i always use when i do not want my professors to notice my lack of understanding : verbosity . quantity is not always good . i would definitely simplify the book and use clearer formulas , a more mathematical approach , better graphs , more information on how these formulas could be derived , less words , fewer sub-chapters , more interesting case studies at the end of the chapters , more problems for self-evaluation at the end of the chapters , clearer examples and illustrations ... . there is so much room to improve that it might be better to rewrite the whole book using a better author .
