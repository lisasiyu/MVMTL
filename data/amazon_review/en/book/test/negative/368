so near , and yet ... annie proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media . this fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot . unfortunately , imagery is about all there is to recommend bad dirt : wyoming stories 2 . the narratives tend to drag in many of the stories , in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for . all in all , for this reader at least , a major disappointment . for readers who have enjoyed other works by proulx , i would n't recommend reading this one
