this book annoyed me . ok so when i first started reading the book i thought all right this is ok. and the book went along and i still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book . then i finished the book and i realized something . nothing had happened really . there was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other . its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it , yeah because that is such a smart thing to do . this book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it . i do n't really understand why so many people love this book . this book is average at best and not much else .
