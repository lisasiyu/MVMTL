science ? i could n't get more disgusted . scientific ? i could n't get more disgusted . this review is written because it can accomplish much , that is , let no one science-interrested person fall in this trap . i did never read more than 20 % of the book , that is a short one , i can only guess that its because there would been to much nonsens even for the most naive readers . i read until i had heard to much about the `` revoloutionating discovery '' ( that you have not heard of in serious papers as nature or new scientist , why ? ) this revaloutionary discovery etc . was a machine build by someone , that claims it could measure feelings , so for example it could measure in a black room when there was a big group of people feeling the same thing , maybe an os contestant from usa ( where the machine would be ) winning the championship in whatever . well , then it was tested in superbowl but failed , the author explains this due to commecials distorting the feelings the public felt etc ... how would this machine be able to notice somethings like this ? well they must have checked out a list of `` strange '' topics from physics and chosen zero point energy that has to do with the vacuum . they could not choose something like electromagnetism , because that might be disregared right away by the public who might know to much about it . claims that the machine is working is based on odds for it not to be this way were apperently about 1:1000 ( i do n't doubt that more than 1000 of these experiments have been made and failed ) the author also claims that there was a scientific explaination with the feeling an moon astronaut felt when he was away from earth , he felt connected to earth in some kind of way . i laugh in disgust , noticing this book is nothing , absolutely nothing , compared to others that actually stand out as great books , giving you an `` wooow ! '' but with a scientificually accepted material as background . examples of these are : qed : the strange theory of light and matter by richard feynman , who was one of three to individually invent quantum electro dynamics , that is the most fundamental description of electromagnetism . this book is based on a series of lectures feynman made in university of auckland , new zeeland , to a public audience . deep down things : the breathtaking beauty of particle physics by bruce a. schumm . a book staying focused on the subject that lies around particle physics , a wooow ! i got from this book was the connections between the mathematical lee groups and the quantum forces of nature ( electromagnetism , the weak force , the strong force ) , discribed greatly on a non professional level
