terrible this is easily one of the worst written , worst researched , and worst argued books i have ever read . in fact it is so bad it is laughable . i do not agree with their views but this has nothing to do with this review . turn to the epilogue and read this statement : `` for example , all prophecy scholars agree that the generation that saw israel restored to her land in 1948 could well be the `` generation [ that ] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened '' ( matthew 24:32-34 , niv ) . '' no one , not even lahaye can actually believe that statement . you ca n't get 10 people to agree on what to have for lunch , how in the world will you ever get people to agree on something as controversial as the interpretation of bible prophecy . other things that had me in stitches was when they said that a past scholar believed there would be 50 years between the rapture and the tribulation . they then go on to state that they are pretty sure he would change his mind if he were alive today . that may be true but why even bring it up . if that makes it in your book you surely must not have much to say . do n't waste your time , money , or effort on this book . i had never read any left behind or other lahaye prophecy books . from the outside in it sure seemed like it was a cash cow with little substance . this absolutely proved to me that my assumption is probably true . ****a side note**** for those commenting on reviews by partial preterists , you really have no idea what you are talking about . i understand the futurist view . i was taught it my whole life and in bible college . i have read books about it including this piece of drivel . the least you can do is read something by demar or gentry and learn what you are arguing against instead of making assumptions . what has been written so far in the reviews really makes you look like you have no idea what you are talking about
