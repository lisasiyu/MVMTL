blowback from our armed invasion of mexico president ulysses grant called the 1846 u.s. invasioin of mexico , `` the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation . '' i see whatever piece of the `` american dream '' that immigrants ( legal or not ) get from coming here as a sort of reparations for all the harm our military empire has caused other nations . pat buchanan has said , `` if people do n't want terrorism , we have to give up our empire . '' i think he 's right , i 'd just add that the same goes for immigration . to curb the influx of economic refugees , we have to reform nafta , end the exploitative behavior of transnationals ( many us-based ) in the maquilladoras , support fair trade , end the dirty work of places like the school of the americas and figures like `` economic hit men , '' and so forth . moreover , wooldridge and others often speak as if the `` minute men '' are the only civic group working on the issue of immigration . thankfully , there are groups like the american friends service committee and border links that have a much more intelligent analysis of migration , and far more humane approaches to this complex issue . as general smedley butler said , `` war is a racket , '' and that includes this war on immigrants . there is a lot of money that is being made from the building of a high-tech fence , aerial drones , motion sensors , videocameras , detention centers , and the other equipment of a police state . if we let that industry grow because of one scare or another . . . well , we wo n't recognize this country as the land of the free and the home of the brave . rather than wooldridge 's fear and resentment-mongering , i 'd recommend the upcoming boook by free speech radio news host , deepa fernandes , which is titled , `` targeted : homeland security and the business of immigration . '' we could also learn a lot by listening to the leaders of mexico 's own movements for justice . there are many books and dvds available regarding the courageous efforts of the zapatistas . `` i would rather die on my feet , than live a lifetime on my knees .
