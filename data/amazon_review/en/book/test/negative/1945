`` he has his father 's eyes '' not anymore ! one of the many things i love about `` rosemary 's baby '' is the magically timeless quality of the story . yes , it takes place in 1966 , but it could conceivably be anywhere , anytime , even perhaps right in your very own home . aside from the brilliant story telling , i think that magical quality is one of the key reasons why the story remains popular . it also goes without saying that the novel and film are both satanic masterpieces , filled with little nuances and gems that continue to reveal themselves with each reading / viewing . an informed eye sees much . however , this novel almost felt like a christian fanatic 's response to the original story . i do n't know of the authors religous affiliations or lack thereof , but one gets the feeling that he ( like many others ) is trying to compensate for their diabolical work . if you have any appreciation or love for `` rosemary 's baby '' , i offer you this advice . accept rosemary smiling smugly as she rocks her baby in the midst of the coven as the ending of the story . no sequeal was needed . of course , you will read it . i did myself in one evening , even as i told myself how much i would regret it later .
