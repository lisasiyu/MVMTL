1 good thought much over-discussed while i thought that ms. warner 's points were accurate , she spends the entire book going over and over the same points until one is simply tired of hearing about the problem with no idea how to escape it . i agree that many of today 's famalies are over-scheduled and spending way too much time at daily multiple activities rather than living . this book points out a problem but does nothing to suggest how to combat it . one quote from the book i found offensive was on pg . 25 , `` i had no qualms about eliminating those activities i found needlessly boring or stupid-like the lap-sit story hour at the nearby american library ... '' as a children 's librarian i guess i took this harder than others would . i agree that many activities could and should be scaled back and or cut , but perhaps ms. warner fails to understand that story hour is an effort to teach parents how to share books at home with kids . of all the things to cut it is my hope people will opt out of soccer for a 3 year old and take a trip to the library once in a while .
