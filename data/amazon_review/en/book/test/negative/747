not what i thought this would be like other reviewers listed here , i thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old ( if not older ) using pithy , witty humor and comparisons of the writer 's life and child 's life . to be fair , there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book , but as an avid cook and child fan i wish there had been more . i think there is a market today for food writing ; good food writing , like mfk fisher and elizabeth david , but i do n't think julie powell even comes close . the julie/julia project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated ( to whatever extent ) in some very profound experiences , like working for the government agency dealing with the world trade center memorials , a household move in nyc , dealing with a less than stellar marraige , and coping with very needy friends and family . julie , get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write ! forget the food , it 's just not you . stick to your hoo-hum job , your even more narcissistic friends , and your boring marraige and you could be the next nora ephron , or at the very least , erma bombeck .
