would not recommend we are in the logistics business and i reviewed this book as a potential teaching tool for management . the book is unfortunatley of little to no value . most concerning is that the mathematics for inventory management , a critical factor in understanding logistics , are simply wrong . even a quick look by anyone familiar with inventory management would find this concerning .
