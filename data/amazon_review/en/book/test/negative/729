1300 pages are too many quigley was a georgetown professor who was permitted access for two years in the early 1960 's to the private archives of the committee on foreign relations , a rockefeller internationalist organization that compliments the work of the trilateral commission and the royal institute of international affairs . it is difficult to determine what the author is trying to communicate . there is no continuity to the book ; nothing ties together quigley 's version of the past and of the future . it 's like reading about the solar system and finding out that the conclusion of the matter is that the sun will expand and burn everything up . you are left wondering , what is the point ? we are left with the suggestion that the elite should continue to guide us in the same direction that we are traveling , but avoiding some of the monumental blunders that they have made in the past . quigley 's version of history consists mostly of unquestioning repetition of propaganda . quigley did a superficial job of analyzing history , and he is even worse at sociology . he touts inclusive diversity as our great strength and greatest gift . perhaps he should have considered the aphorism , `` divide and conquer . '' the west , or any other empire , can only flourish when it concentrates on matters of common concern , not divisivness quigley does slightly better with economics and foreign policy , which are more in his area of expertise . he correctly observes that british and american `` victories '' in wwi and wwii resulted in the almost total destruction of international law . quigley is in favor of the idea of continental blocs replacing national states . as globalization unfolds , quigley exposes some of the hypocrisy and bungling , yet he inexplicably remains committed to the overall plan . so , what is the point of all of this costly meddling ? quigley predicts success ... and then failure . `` we shall undoubtedly get a universal empire in which the u.s. will rule most of western civilization . this will be followed by a period of decay and ultimately by invasions and the total destruction of western culture . '' could n't we save ourselves the trouble and just mind our own business ? minding our own business is a concept based on the idea that the electorate is in control of the government , and that we have a choice . however , quigley admits that international financiers influence and control governments . quigley says that the internationalists , who prefer to remain in the background , should be known for their `` valuable '' contributions . what these contributions amount to is that they want world government , and they intend to cram it down everyone 's throats . as we slouch toward financial , industrial , and government monopoly the author reminds us of some of the casualties . `` as economic enterprises have become larger and more tightly integrated into one another , the freedom , individualism , and initiative traditionally associated with the modern economy have to be sacrificed . '' quigley acknowledges that in our future , `` in general , there will be a very considerable modification of the areas and objectives of freedom in all societies of the world , with gradual reduction of numerous personal freedoms of the past . '' to add to this loss of freedom , quigley bemoans our loss of a spiritual mooring and suggests a return to the values of christianity ! his version of christianity , of course . still full of contradictions , quigley cleaves to relativism rather than absolutes , approximations rather than final answers-not realizing that the adoption of these mindsets are what weakened the appeal of christianity . finally , as we follow our present course , quigley predicts an age of conflict characterized by class struggle , war , irrationality , and declining progress . obviously , we 're there now . rather than attack his sponsors , who are bringing us this new world order , quigley vents his frustration on the middle class . quigley touts the moral superiority of both the rich and poor , but he asserts that the middle class consists of poorly-informed , neurotic , bourgeois , radical-right republicans . worst of all , they have puritanical attitudes toward sex . the many internal contradictions in this book indicate a confused mind or a shallow thinker . the author 's history is mostly stale propaganda , spiced up with occasional pro-government cheerleading or tales of government boondoggles . maybe if quigley had broken this monstrosity into several different books , he would have had something coherent to say . in this book , quigley 's conclusion is almost totally divorced from the rest of the book . this effort spanned 20 years , and possibly senility was sneaking up on the author .
