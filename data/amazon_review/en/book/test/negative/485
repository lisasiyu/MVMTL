cute but no substance this book is more of a magazine ( with advertisements ! ) . while it has many cute pages that parents have made with a photo or two , the descriptions of how each page was done are only useful for people who have enough scrapbooking experience to recognize the brief and sometimes obscure references to paper and lettering sources . there are almost no explanations of how the pages were created ( no step by step instructions or tips or anything ) except to identify the sources of the products used . a big disappointment
