with friends like these ... this book is trash written by a man with no faculty for research and no clear understanding of the subject . first define eccentric people as unconventional types who are healthy , happy and functional ( unhappy , nonfunctional types are after all neurotic- not eccentric ) . then make the astounding discovery that eccentrics are happier , healthier and more functional than the average . if this sounds like science to you then you might enjoy the book . the author fails to distinguish between eccentrics who do n't care about conformity , and those unfortunates who are grossly deluded or constitutionally incapable of conformity . the author fails to recognise cold-blooded social sarcasm as oppposed to eccentricity . as an experienced eccentric i found the book poorly thought out , self contradictory , and somewhat patronizing
