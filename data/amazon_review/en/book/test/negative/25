agenda here ? well in my opinion , there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies , and some people have had some unusual experiences ( mostly disturbing , but some apparrently enlightening ) , but the question is , is it all as it seems ? the fact of the matter is , various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us . holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys ( this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events ) ; there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario ; advanced , drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour ; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now ( verichip ) . i 'm not saying that other lifeforms do n't exist in the universe ( far from it ) , and perhaps there are a number of entities here on earth carrying out agendas , but this idea that there are little , menacing greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense collusion seems suspect . it smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us . historically , there 's been the barbarians , huns , mongols , pagans , jews , christians , vikings , black natives , cannabals , red natives , mexicans , germans , nazis , communists , now the arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on earth . even president reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80 's . the fact is that with known technology ( not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked ) , they could quite easily pull the hoax off . even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and practiced ( albeit `` underground '' ) than most people can fathom . what has become another fact is the major extent to which the ufo community has been infiltrated and compromised , of which strieber has been front and centre at various times . my belief is that strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign , sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups . in this book , his `` hard-evidence '' is flimsey and suspicious . for example , why would n't super advanced aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue ( thus not showing up on any x-ray , mri , ct , etc ) ? and design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body ? surely , this would be child 's play for alien scientists ? why no major discussion or mention of the human military , or nazi connection with abductions ? there seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange `` fragments '' of memories that are slipping through various memory covers . why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the greys ? why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms ? why are some speaking english , others german ? why is there a connection with deep , underground bases and specifically antartica ? these are things strieber never mentions , which i find curious . my point is , things are happening , but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what , and strieber 's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas .
