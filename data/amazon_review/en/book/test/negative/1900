few options when it comes to this subject this is a fantastic study in the psychology of the mind of a megamaniacal dilettant who , like many of them , believe they are participants in , not just the scribes of , history . witness lines from goltz 's book like `` it was my own little gesture at stopping world war iii '' . as a study of this under-reported conflict , unfortunately it 's just about the only way to get any information at all in english , hence the two stars . and goltz is not only up front about his pro-turkic bias ( his wife is turkish ) , he is honest about the failings of the azerbaijani government 's policies , and reasons for loss of this war . there are a lot of facts here , in spite of what the more vituperative reviewers claim on this page . the problem with the book is goltz 's unbearable self-importance and flat tone of voice . goltz published an earlier book called `` requiem for a would-be republic '' from which most of this book is extracted . `` requiem '' has a very rushed ( and amateurish ) feel and `` az diary '' did n't even bother to correct that . maybe mr. goltz has read a little too much hunter s. thompson ? or maybe he 's rushing to meet some deadline ? if mr. goltz is reading this , i would recommend he read michael herr 's `` dispatches '' before writing another book . mr. goltz also , the reader will notice , behaves like he knows the history of the region , when clearly he does n't know anything but what he was told on the ground . if you can overlook pretentiousness , absence of historical context and flatness of tone , there is some value in this book . if only a better and more imaginative writer had goltz 's courage to be in azerbaijan at the time of the conflict . i agree with other reviewers that mr. goltz is probably not a paid propagandist . there is no evidence of this ; to me he comes off as just a sucker who got taken in by a cause not rightly his , and who wants , for personal reasons , to be the champion of a people he sees , rightly or wrongly , as victims of injustice
