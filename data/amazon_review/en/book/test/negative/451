waste of time i wasted time reading this book that i will never get back . it was repetitive , predictable , and drawn out . i only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending , but it turned out the way i thought it would . buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly , and for predicting how the story goes . but , i would not waste the time if i were you
