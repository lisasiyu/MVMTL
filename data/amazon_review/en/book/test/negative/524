too biased it is alright to present an alternative point of view , but it is not right to attack other recovery programs , especially those with a proven track record . i suspect mr. trimpey has an axe to grind or is just hostile to the spiritual underpinnings of 12-step programs.the truth is that one size does not fit all . some methodswork for some people and other methods work for others . read this book and try this method . if it does not work try another one . they are all good in their own way . but mr. trimpey : if one person , who can not be helped by your method , ignores other options because of your attack on aa , you should be ashamed of yourself
