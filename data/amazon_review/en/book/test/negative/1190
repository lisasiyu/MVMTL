not too sexy here pat califa wrote , `` our culture insists on sexual uniformity and does not acknowledge any neutral difference only crimes , sins , disease and mistakes . '' such we see represented in dr. amen 's book . dr. amen makes reference to what he considers normal sexually in his book . like so many clinicians and diastognicians his normality is of a vanilla world . anything outside of that is referred to as an imbalance in the brain or a disorder . my own research has been focused on debunking the myths about sexuality that are perpetuated in this book . the chapter on addictions and fetishes lacks any creative thinking whatsoever . unfortunately i returned the book to the bookstore due to the limited thinking represented here . sincerely , ilona paris , lmhc
