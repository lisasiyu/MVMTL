presents god as weak , vulnerable , and limited in a time when reformed theology is on the rise , pinnock and his co-authors seek to provide an arminian understanding of scripture . however , the book is strewn with problems . the authors claim that god 's love trumps other attributes like holiness and justice , but they give no scriptural support . their arguments are based simply on our western sense of fairness . they make such appeals because they believe our moral sense reflects truth , instead of recognizing our fallen nature . in addition , they advocate `` making peace with the culture of modernity '' ( 27 ) . instead of letting god 's word shape our thinking , they allow our lost culture to shape our view of god 's word . the result is a presentation of a weak , helpless god . in fact , the authors state `` it is more important for god to give himself to his creation than to rule the world or to be worshipped '' ( 35 ) . he is described not as ruling , but as `` limited by humanity '' ( 40 ) , vulnerable , and `` the defenseless superior power '' ( 175 ) . the book has weak , humanistic argumentation , little scriptural support , and a harsh tone toward those who embrace reformed views , views said to be `` theologically repugnant '' ( 84 ) . do not waste your time with this book . while there are legitimate differences between arminian and calvinistic views and a place for dialogue , this book does not give dialogue but instead gives unsubstantiated claims that leave you with a helpless god not in control and not worthy of worship . in case you do not know , the editor of this book embraces the view that god does not know the future .
