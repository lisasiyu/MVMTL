southern accents ? i thought the narrator was terrible . she is under the impression that people in upstate new york have southern accents . or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place . it must be the mint juleps that confused her . you 'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy , but i guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author 's work , they certainly could n't worry about the narrator 's accents
