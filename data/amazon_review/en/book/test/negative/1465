useless text you 'd better hope you 've got a good professor for dynamics , because this book is absolutely no help . it gives proofs for most equations , but does n't seem to think any amount of example problems are necessary . i have the bootleg copy of the solutions manual for this book and the author solves most of the problems with bizarre calculus that is n't discussed in the chapter at all . to top it off , the set ( statics and dynamics ) was $ 180 at my college bookstore . pool your money with your classmates , buy one copy of each , and xerox the problems . you will not miss anything
