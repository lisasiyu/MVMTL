an absolute yawnfest ! when i read stuff on the back of this novel like , `` preposterously brilliant '' , `` a classic comic novel '' , and `` amis was a genuine comic writer , perhaps the best '' , i immediately snatched this book up and started rummaging through the sentences , paragraphs , and chapters with heightened interest . the book was interesting enough for me to buy it from borders bookstore 30 minutes after reading a bit . even though i did n't laugh , i believed i just had to read it from beginning to end . so i took this book home expecting something hilarious ; the result : a genuine cure for insomnia . i do n't care for all these praises of `` masterpiece '' or `` this book explores the complexities of human condition and human relations '' . i want an interesting read ; i 'm not calling for an action-packed ian fleming , james bond novel , i 'm asking for something engrossing . i did n't get what i asked for . the visually descriptive details in this novel are thoroughly lacking . amis does n't bother to write about the setting , the atmosphere , the people ( except for bertrand , christine , and margaret to some degree ) ; as a result i have no idea what welch , dixon , beesley , etc . look like . they all could be wearing bedsheets all the time for all i know . all in all , this novel is not recommended : it lacks physical detail and humor . p.s . if you search all the previous good recommendations you 'll see the high reviews were simply given by `` a reader '' ; probably the same dude
