a letter to sean hannity ... dear sean , thanks for sending me your book `` deliver us from evil : defeating terrorism , despotism , and liberalism . '' before i put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep i just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me . let me get this straight . you 'd like to see all liberals vanish from the face of the american political system and have only conservative republicans running the show ... is that right ? hmm ... let me see , if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system . there was the soviet union 1917-1991 , fascist italy 1923-1945 , nazi germany 1933-1945 . those are three just off the top of my head . they did n't like liberalism either . well , sean i got to get going . i 'm sure i 'll write again soon . all my best , bill ps . remember , fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced
