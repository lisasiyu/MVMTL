you have got to be kidding ! my twins are 3 1/2 and have not wanted to start potty training . i thought i would buy this book and see if i could have success . the day after i ordered the book , i bought my daughter some princess underwear and she suddenly became very excited about the prospect of not wearing diapers . my son immediately followed suit . unfortunately , the book had not arrived yet , so i just had to use some common sense and good instincts . lucky for me , this worked and my twins were potty trained by the end of the week and ready for school after easter break . i offered no rewards other than praise . i did not use a doll . i did not do any of the ridiculous things suggested by this book which seems very outdated . at the end of the first week back at school , the book finally arrived . i decided to read it just to see what it said and was glad it arrived so late . if you have not bought a book yet , do n't buy this one . just use common sense , do n't try to train too early and let your child 's success be its own reward
