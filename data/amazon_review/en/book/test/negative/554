elementary school returns i bought this book because it was required ( a textbook for a class i was taking ) . because it was a college-level class , i was expecting a college-level textbook . that 's not what it is at all . the book is filled with color illustrations that are n't even very helpful . i was hoping for more reading and explanation of terms . illustrations are great if they are used right -- to compliment the text instead of replace it . i would n't recommend this book for someone who is serious about learning the ins and outs of networking
