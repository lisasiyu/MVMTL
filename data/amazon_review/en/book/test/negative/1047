review - understanding financial statements , 6th ed . the presentation of the content assumes that the reader has some knowledge of this content area and at times leaves him/her confused as to what was discussed , making it difficult to understand . examples that are used are often incomplete and do not provide a complete picture of how statements are generated . as someone who has no knowledge or experience in this area , i found it to be frustrating to read and comprehend the information . not a good choice if you are a novice . too bad i could not give it zero stars
