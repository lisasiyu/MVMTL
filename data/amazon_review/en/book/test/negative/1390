agree with disappointment so far i am disappointed and i have n't even read it yet . if anything steve has written and quoted out of the book is correct then it is just another case of the blind leading the blind . please read his review and decide for yourself . i still plan to buy the book but as with everything else i will take it with a huge chunk of salt . sounds to me like the so called `` conservatives '' have just put out another book to `` unbiasedly '' support their positions and make it easier to swallow by the masses . there is no such thing as a conservative any more . if you want to get back to constitutional government , go check out the libertarian party and view their positions . they come the closest to truly supporting a government of the people , by the people and for the people . the rest of them are still just self serving and do n't want to let go of their power and your money . dan
