boring i saw the author during a book signing on television . i saw a young , intelligent , articulate lady who had some very interesting ideas about american culture . i picked up the book to learn more about her and her ideas . unfortunately , though there is a lot of meat in this book , simply put , i was bored ... bored ... bored . this is not a subject i take lightly and believe me , i wanted to like this book because i like the author . i have to agree with a lot of the reviewers here . there is a lot of data and no real point . a lousy effort and there are few people more disappointed than me
