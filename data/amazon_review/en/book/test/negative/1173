it is outdated . this was the bible i used for a project , i loved the ideas and i named the classes after the names in this book . however , 3 years later , after reviewing this book , i would say , many ideas in the book are already outdated and over emphasized in the past . just remember the good old days when ejb was glorious and almost every company went for it . after the ejb rush , now when we are back to basic , we realized that many plain old design patterns are real gold . i would suggest you do n't rely heavily on j2ee , focus on domain design instead . many books provide this advice on domain driven development , such as design patterns , refactoring , domain driven design . after you read those books , then read this book again . you will agree with this review . http : //www.amazon.com/books-for-professional-java-developers/lm/r34sz976nxxd22/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full/104-7074534-463355
