get the swatter ! this book does start with some slight promise . it has a touching opening chapter . and it follows the life story of one of its villains , who is a very unlikely , over-the-top character , but who nevertheless will probably win your sympathy and may even break your heart . the book also has plenty of cornwell 's trademark technical detail . you will be treated to a wide variety of how-to tips on everything from how to fly a helicopter , to what gun to carry for different law enforcement jobs , to how to identify watermarks on paper . but overall , i found this book to be a big disappointment . first of all , the book is riddled with egomania . almost every chapter contains some lavish adulation of the protagonist , kate scarpetta . almost every character oozes adoration of scarpetta , lives only to win her respect , longs for her , even in planning to kill her seeks only to unite with her in ecstasy . what 's all this about ? since scarpetta is so clearly cornwell 's alterego , a reader can only conclude that cornwell herself is getting lost in a cult of personality . however , scarpetta does n't appear much in person in this book . she remains a presence , inspiring others . when she does make a personal appearance though , the book 's tone of adoration does n't mute into any more seemly modesty , as would seem appropriate when an author is in essence describing herself . if anything , the deification of scarpetta intensifies in these scenes . for example , a man observing her , notes how deliberately she does everything . even in the act of reaching for her coffee cup , he sees her `` exuding confidence and power . '' really , all this reverence for scarpetta turns these pages into absurdity . even apart from their hero worship of scarpetta though , many of the other characters in the book are manifestly improbable , or even impossible . a book could perhaps stand one over-the-top villain , such as the bizarrely afflicted one i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review . however , most of the characters in blowfly , evildoers and presumed good guys alike , are leading lives of such mythic proportions , that the book loses all touch with reality . scarpetta 's niece , who has been an on-going character in cornwell 's books , turns into a full-blown cartoon superheroine here , with preternatural command and capabilities across international borders . one of the actions this niece involves herself with in this book is so outrageous and of such questionable morality , that this subplot would seem more appropriate as back-story for a nintendo game . there are also specific stylistic problems with the book . cornwell has often used the technique of short chapters , snapshots of sorts , interlacing the actions of the different characters . the technique can be a valid one , building suspense while you are briefly diverted from one character 's pending homicide , to the less crucial actions of some subsidiary player . and the technique can be used like a mosaic , to build a picture tile-by-tile . but with blowfly , the chapters have become so short that it seems a mere pandering to readers ' presumed short attention spans . i 'll admit the tv ad pace of the book kept me going through to the end . snap . snap . snap . now this . now the other . but i 'm not proud of my growing addiction to this kind of hit-and-run narration . then there 's the persistent , occasionally jarring use of the present tense - in a context in which this could n't all possibly be happening in real time . and there are too many ongoing , hackneyed analogies between the brain and various machines . cornwell has always liked these comparisons , but they become constant pebbles in the shoe here . `` no frontal lobe alarm sounds '' rang ... `` ... her brain ca n't process '' ... `` jerking her mind out of gear '' ... finally , there is the problem with the book 's ending . it 's as if cornwell ran out of paper , or else was ordered by her publisher to simply turn in her manuscript , finished or not . all her knowledge of csi investigative technique count for nothing in the end . none of the plot threads get really integrated into coherence . so there are a few good things about blowfly . you get to inhabit another serial killer 's mind and daily squalid living conditions with creepy intimacy . there are also some interesting psychological insights into the motives of female accomplices or `` enablers '' of such men . there are things to be learned about defense weapons . but these good things get swamped , like the dead bodies that fall into the bayous of baton rouge where much of this book 's action takes place . overall , i 'd say if you see this blowfly coming your way - get out the flyswatter !
