disappointing breaking the chain was a truely disappointing book for me . although the sub-title is & quot ; the true story & quot ; it seemed that the text reflected more innuendo than it did & quot ; truth & quot ; concerning drug use in the cycling world . in a time when the cycling world is trying to get back on it 's feet after being rocked with gossip about drug use ( particularly epo ) , the book seems to add to , rather than take away from , the culture of rumor . i finished the book with the feeling that the author wrote it not to inform the world of drug use in professional cycling , but rather as a means of making money ( now that he was without employment ) . i am sorry that i may have contributed to his retirement fund by purchasing the book
