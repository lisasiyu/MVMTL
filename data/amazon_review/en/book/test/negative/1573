very badly written book first things firts ... ..i am clueless as to why the reviews online for this book have stars enough to fill the sky . unless written by friends ( that too , the really good and loyal ones ) the book would not deserve even a 2 star . infact i looked for 1/2 a star and couldnt find one . the narration is plainly put , silly and yada yada . rambling without a direction and generous usage of indian words like chambu is totally uncalled for considering the that the target is a world audience . amulya should read and re re re read arundati roy 's god of small things to see how the soft balance between something indian yet talking crystal clear to the western soul is acheived . i read blurbs of the other books written by amulya and the narrative is as blah as it is in this one . i am not trying to be vicious here , but plain frank since the other reviews are so unreasonably off the target . a very boringly , tedious , soporiphic rambling of a book . i would not recommend this to any one
