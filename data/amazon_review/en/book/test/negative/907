good enough to make you wish it were better . i have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an american teacher named hope and po-yu ( paul ) , her chinese student . on one hand , it was often very interesting , as ms. liu gives a lot of historical detail about san francisco and china . on the other hand , the characters were rather shallow . i did n't find hope , who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day , particularly appealing . po-yu was far more interesting , and was portrayed with some complexity and depth . the romance between hope and po-yu rang false for me . ( `` honey , i first fell in love with you when i realized it was required for the plot to progress ! '' ) i still ca n't see what attracted them to each other . also , did anyone else notice that any slight against hope is recorded with meticulous detail ( the rampant racism against chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned ) , but ms. liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel : a hearty blonde swede , a drunk , surly irishwoman , and hope 's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few . also , she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize : all the britons in the book are `` right-o , jolly-good '' bigots , and all the christians are consistently hypocritical , or stupid , or both . in addition , much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they 're just the opposite . and to top it all off , the ending was forced . this novel could have been so much better : as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents , she obviously had some fascinating material to work with . and one more quibble : one of hope and po-yu 's daughters is named jennifer pearl . in 1908 the name jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world : cornwall , uk
