another ploy to ensure that the layman must hire an attorney i agree that this book is absolutely essential to lawschool or practicing law . that 's what makes even more horrible ! ! ! i studied english all through college , and relied on the mla handbook , which is great ! ! why ca n't the bluebook people hire the mla people to come up with a legal reference book that is well-organized and not utterly confusing ! ! of course , this review is worthless , b/c if you plan on going to lawschool , working as a paralegal , or doing anything legal , the bluebook is a must have , and there 's no way getting around it
