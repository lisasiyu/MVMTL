not for me thanks -- a very incomplete , unsatisfying program let me first say that i 've done this program several times over the past few years , and stayed on it each time for at least 6 months . it did not do much for me . my physique did not change , nor did the way i felt . i 'm in good shape anyway , but i certainly did not build muscle mass . as far as strength goes , there 's no possible way to test whether these exercises really build strength or not . i suppose you could subjectively say whether you felt stronger doing day to day activities , or test yourself with weights but neither of those is optimal . i 'd say that if you want to exercise without apparatus , and are interested in improving your appearance , conditioning , energy levels etc that there are more effective ways of doing so . either ross enamait 's books , or combat conditioning and combat abs would be an improvement . i do combat conditioning and combat abs most days and they 've done me a world of good as far as conditioning , strength and flexibility , which are all things miracle seven did not . and , i do n't spend more than 20 minutes a day doing them . for all the silly furey marketing techniques ( and he 's as egregious as they come regarding his advertising ) a combination of both of those furey books will do far more for you than miracle seven , which is a very incomplete program that you 'll need to add conditioning and flexibility work to
