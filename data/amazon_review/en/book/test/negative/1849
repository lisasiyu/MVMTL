started off so well ... . the first book of this trilogy is the best . so rich in detail . well defined characters . such a good pace . it made me scour every bookshop i knew looking for the second and third books . when i found them , i got a distinct feeling that something or someone was rushing ms. hearn to finish the series ... or she got bored with japan ... .whatever the reason is it is to the detriment of the plot . you know when an unimaginative/bored person is telling a story ? there 's a lot of `` and then ... and then and then ... '' . hope you get my drift .
