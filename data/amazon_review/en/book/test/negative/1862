lacks depth important to flash 8 gonzalez 's `` flash professional 8 '' underscores a deficiency common to many flash instructional texts , where they spend half the book examining very basic subjects such as timeline-based animation and drawing tools . granted , this book does a nice job illustrating some basics to flash , but the level of discourse here does not inspire conceptual creativity . good books should lead to greater things , and not simply review the same basic subjects discussed since flash 4 . one reason why books like this exist is that flash is poorly documented out of the box . yet any decent used book on flash mx will upstage this one . while this book may lack instructional spirit , the most glaring omission is found in its actionscript chapter . ever since mx , the emphasis behind flash has been the power and flexibility of actionscript . granted , actionscript has become rather complicated , but a good author should at least prime the reader to the coding power available in flash 8 . instead , we 're treated to a weak smattering of script usage , without touching on the real power behind flash today : classes and object-oriented structure . as if that deficiency were n't glaring enough , the author provided examples of button coding that were outdated since flash 5 ! there is no excuse for such weak writing . you the reader deserve a better challenge to expand and hone your flash skills . i 'm giving this book special scrutiny because lynda weinman 's textbooks have such visibility and apparent acclaim . while her books may be well marketed , they are n't always the best use of your money -- or time spent reading . let me suggest a few texts which i have read personally and can recommend . if you want a good beginner guide , check out russell chun 's `` visual quickpro '' flash books . more inspiring , project-related books are found under the friends of ed publishing line by sham bhangal . the most detailed and authoritative books i 've read are colin moock 's definitive guides , the other texts by o'reilly , especially those which touch on oop in detail . the last ones are tough at first , but they really open you up the power of flash . and that in-depth actionscript power is what your future employers will be looking for . good luck .
