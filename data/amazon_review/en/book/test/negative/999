perhaps , just rhetoric ! despite the praise heaped on this text , i ca n't help feeling that bernard faure has been constructing the 'straw men ' other readers have spotted . it is by no means certain that the ch'an ( zen ) tradition has functioned as faure suggests . why , for instance , set up the 'anti-scriptural ' argument - only to concede - on proper investigation , that it is a myth ? there are enough commentaries - on the sutras , by zen monks , to make this sort of thing seem pointless . sorry , but lets place trust in those deluded masters of old - and stay unenlightened , faure style .
