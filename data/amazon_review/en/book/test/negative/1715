not on of brauns best i 've read some of the braun series cat books and this one was n't one of my favorites . it was boring with no plot and it did mention very little about the butterfly girl or who she is . the story did n't make any sense at all . i could n't get into this one . i read it but was disappointed in it . i 'm lucky that i only paid $ 1 for it towards charity
