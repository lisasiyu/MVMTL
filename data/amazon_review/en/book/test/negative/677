not a translation . i started reading this book , skipping the introduction and then realized this is n't the tao te ching at all . this is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said , and so he wrote his own version . it turns out the author admits this in the introduction . i wish i had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk . i guess i should have taken the hint with the `` a new version '' doublespeak on the front cover . sigh . i usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs .
