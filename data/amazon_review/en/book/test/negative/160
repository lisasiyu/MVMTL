little more than a collection of anecdotes intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new `` web 2.0 '' universe , i was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis . from the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis ( that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group ) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author 's argument . the book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance . i would qualify it as a light business read , entertaining but not quite convincing if you 're not part of the choir
