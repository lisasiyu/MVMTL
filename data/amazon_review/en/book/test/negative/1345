too postmodern , disconnected from biblical truths i received my first edition ordering your private world ( opw ) in 1985 , as an undergraduate . i did n't really like the touchy-feely style of presentation , without any corroborrating references , for example , to the author 's science of sleep minimization nor a biblically developed case for journaling . i remain puzzled on many points in the book . contrary to the author 's position , the psalmist tells us that & quot ; god grants sleep to those he loves & quot ; . while journaling can be a productive discipline , could it also lead to indulgent self-absorption ? and if the journal is a private work , why would it be a treasure to posterity ? as i realize that the author 's life could be construed as fairly disordered , at least from several direct observations i 've had of him failing to keep his commitments ( from the time of his original opw to the time of this new edition ) , i feel less discomfort in providing a less than enthusiastic review . during my recent move to a new home , i decided to discard a box of & quot ; low-utility & quot ; books . without reticence , i included my old copy of opw in the junk box . how ironic , perhaps even spirit guided , my consternation when the current opw was required reading for an upcoming leadership course , and i had to further donate to the author 's estate given how i remembered the first edition . perhaps that cost could be redeemed by this feedback . a basic issue for many christians is living the & quot ; driven vs. called & quot ; life . i believe that the book will be more convicting to those who are driven , because they may experience some empathy with and conviction from the author , who himself is an admitted driven personality . for such a reader , i can only conclude that replacing the drivenness to succeed with a pursuit of god 's calling can only expand his creative purpose and kingdom . i believe that the author is a fellow believer of jesus christ , and has been redeemed by god for his purpose . i suspect that i am as much as a sinner as he is , but i 'm not the one peddling orderly life advice . now that i have now read the latest edition , i am still recommending that this probably is not worth your time or money
