40 % cliches my real rating is 1.5 stars . the book wo n't put you to sleep , but it 's not going to teach you anything you wo n't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years . readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport : though the closest i 've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood , i learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent . feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context : what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity . hence , for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time , the book will be useless . bad points : besides that mentioned , the prose is ( as mentioned in my title ) in large measure cliches and reads , as other reviewers have pointed out , like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure . for newspaper articles , such is no great handicap , but for a book is makes for tediousness . next is a quibble , perhaps , but in the trade paperback edition i picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book . the book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper . if you 're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none ( as i was when i selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion ) , `` a good walk spoiled '' will suffice . if you 're looking for a good book , look elsewhere
