it 's a tad on the euro-socialist side , but marcus is n't a bad artist i thought the art had a certain charm , and used strictly as a picture book for children who ca n't yet read , i think it 's quite nice . ( too bad you ca n't make up your own story to go with it . ) the moment the child starts to read , though -- better hide it quick , because ... unfortunately , the book reads like a condensed communist manifesto for kids ( as others have noted ) , or a socialist agenda primer . i do n't know for sure that 's what marcus pfister had as an aim , and i 'm not going to speculate on his politics . he has three kids and may raise them as he likes , and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat . yes , i suppose sharing is nice . certainly sharing one 's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing -- but in america , we get paid for that ( charity is voluntary , not coerced ) . furthermore , stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting ( not necessarily better , just unique and interesting ) , or giving away all your possessions , is a lousy way to make and keep friends , is n't it ? is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy ( a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change , not pandering ) ? is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad ? almost seems like it , at least to me . furthermore , there 's an overtone of `` only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth , '' which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever i 've seen . of course , people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me , but that wo n't make them right . ( the two stars , if you must know , are for the art .
