complaint - poor quality the book i received appears a very cheap copy of the original book . there is no isbn and copyright page , even the cover appears a cheap colour photocopy . what 's the story ? ? you pay $ 20 for a book you expect to get a quality printed book . it mentions that it is published by harper collins though i am unable to find any reference to it on their website . i believe amazon and/or the author owe buyers an explanation
