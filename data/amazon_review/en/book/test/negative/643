lightweight and disappointing this guide to culinary careers is terribly overpriced for the information it contains . the quick descriptions of different culinary careers have some value , as do the appendices listing culinary publications and organizations . however , the career descriptions are quite short and the advice is unremarkable . on the topic of finding a culinary mentor , for example , the author advises you to find one . that 's pretty much it - no discussion on how to choose a suitable mentor , or how to convince an experienced professional to take you on as a protege . the book mentions the apprenticeship system but does n't explain how to find an apprenticeship . the section on choosing a culinary school/vocational program is much better , though . something trumpeted in both the book description here and on both covers of the actual book is the inclusion of up-to-date information on salary statistics and earning potential for the spectrum of culinary professionals . it must have been printed in invisible ink , because i do n't see it *anywhere* ( and yes , i have this exact edition ) . this promise was my primary motivation for getting the book , so i was very disappointed ( disgruntled , even ) that this information is not in the book after all . do n't spend money on this book unless you 're just looking for a quick overview of the career possibilities . that 's the one thing the author does well - it describes ( in brief ) a wide range of culinary careers beyond the obvious white-linen restaurant ones . this book could have been greatly improved if it had expanded on the career descriptions , perhaps including short interviews with actual culinary professionals , especially those in roles like institutional cooking or food research . of course it also would have been much better if it had actually included the promised salary information , too . it 's a good book to have in a library or career center , but it 's not much use for your home reference bookshelf
