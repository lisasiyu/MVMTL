caution when ordering this workbook ! i had purchased this workbook intending to use it to help study for the pmp exam . although the workbook does contain over 300 pages of sample questions that might be helpful in studying for the exam , it does not include answers to any of the questions . therefore , there is no way to verify that you 've answered the questions correctly , which made the workbook of very little value to me . i decided to return it to amazon unused
