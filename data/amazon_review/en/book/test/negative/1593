old delinsky material is misleading and not very good ! i have read all of barbara delinsky 's books . of those books , there have been a number of rereleases . what is annoying is that alot of romance writers are doing this , and their material is not always as good as the current price of a paperback . if a book was released in 1983 the price of the paperback should be lower , and the cover of the paperback should also have an indication that this book has just been rereleased with the current content untouched . i 'm from ottawa , canada and this paperback was very expensive . alot of money for an outdated storyline and not much of a story to tell
