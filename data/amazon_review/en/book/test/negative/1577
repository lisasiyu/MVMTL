the secret doctrine of the rosicrucians i am a rosicrucian and this book is not about rosicrucians or their doctrines . as far as i can make out this is from one of those `` wantabes '' . i found it to be totally useless . if you are truely interested in mystical knowledge , the school still exists and is very welcoming to seekers . ( google amorc ) if you are only seeking a book try the wisdom of the mystic masters by joseph j weed . this book gives a true overview of rc . the focus in on practical self development that can be used right here on the earth plane for your evolution . its a wonderful life , if you have the right atttiude and are willing to change !
