mastering scanner stuff buying this book should have been called `` what can you buy if you are thinking about playing with scanner '' , and it is good at that . it does not tell you much about scanning , it is more about buying equipment , and possibly software related to scanning . just think about it : there is a chapter `` where to buy '' , and a chapter `` buying on ebay '' . there is no chapter `` do this if you miss shadow detail '' , though . this book is aimed at a high school student who is doing his/her first steps with a film camera and wants to get those pictures into the computer ( is there such a person these days ? ) the book even mentions cross processing . no , it does not say what should you do if you need to scan a cross-processed film . it just says that you can process your film in the wrong developer and it will affect the image on the film . i was greatly impressed by the chapter on sending off your slides for scanning . well you definetly need a book to tell you that you can do that , and it greatly improves your scanning skills if i had a chance to look at the book at the local store i would not ever buy it . now it goes back to amazon
