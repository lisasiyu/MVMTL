when talk is not cheap the criticism that a lot of the perfume and aromatherapy community has leveled at this book has been that there is nothing in this book that is not already in print . i 'd be willing to agree with that . considering that chrissie wildwood is out of print , and that arctander and tisserand are hard to find inexpensively , this book is an okay stand-in for those which preceded it . it is not the final authority however , despite the glowing reviews . get the original works from these three authors if you possibly can , if you consider yourself a perfumery scholar
