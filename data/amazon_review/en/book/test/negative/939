do n't know much about 50 states i have read and reviewed many children 's books in my 28 years as an elementary school librarian , and have found none with more glaringly inaccurate and unclear writing : washington is the evergreen state , not the `` chinook state '' , mt.st . helens did not have `` lava '' flows as the text says it did , the section about the state says that the chinook winds are a `` pair of winds '' and does not explain what they are , they are warm winds that sometimes flow from east to west bringing warm air west . as a native of washington , i began , and ended , reading in the section on our state . after reading the section i did not bother to check to see if the other states information was as inaccurate and poorly written , as i knew that i certainly would not want this book in any library nor in the hands of any children , dispite the vissual appeal .
