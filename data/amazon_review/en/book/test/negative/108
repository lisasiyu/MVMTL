a depressing story about miserable people living in a desolate place . after reading `` the kite runner '' - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship , loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in afghanistan during the russian war and the taliban rule , i set out expecting more of the same from the swallows of kabul . the latter was quite disapointing . the swallows of kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence , cruelty and desolation of their surroundings . the dismal context of this story is properly set up . enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the taliban and the desperation of the afghan people is clearly communicated . unfortunately , the novel reads like a short story . proper character development is not established , so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits . the novel is successful in painting a truly depressing picture of afghanistan , making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place . but if you 're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances , then i would n't recommend this book for you . i was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down
