could n't finish it ... i tried many times to finish this book because once i buy it and start it , i hate to just walk away from it . but , this book did it . i was never really interested in the plot , i thought the writing was very basic , elementary actually , slow , and just plain boring . i tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up , but i never did get into to , making this the only book i 've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing
