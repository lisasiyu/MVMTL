not nearly as good as other london travel books i 'm amazed at the positive reviews this book has received . if found it severely lacking for a number of reasons : first , it has very few maps , the ones it does have are terrible , and there is no coordination between descriptions of things and their location on the maps . second , it lacks the kind of detail that you 'll find in some other books . finally , the section dealing with accommodations is almost completely useless . overall , i was extremely disappointed with this book . if you want really good london tavel guides , the rough gude to london and the eyewitness london guide are far , far better
