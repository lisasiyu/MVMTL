neither global , nor a telecommunications book ! neither author is a telecom professional . the lan discussion is 1 page ; the wan discussion is 1 more page . the word & quot ; enterprise & quot ; does not appear in the index , but & quot ; sexual motivation & quot ; does . likewise , frame relay , atm , sonet/sdh are omitted from the book . isdn receives exactly 2 sentences . the striking lack of telecommunications and technology could be forgiven , except for the equally apparent lack of global business discussion . the term & quot ; multinational & quot ; ca n't be found ; neither can & quot ; itu & quot ; or its erstwhile equivalent & quot ; ccitt & quot ; . if you 're looking for a discussion or reference on the role of telecommunications in the increasing global economy , this book is not for you
