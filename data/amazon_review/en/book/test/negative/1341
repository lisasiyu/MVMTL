what does the turkey have to do with this mystery ? i was disappointed in this book . i had started getting these books on cd from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few i listened to . i enjoy the author 's picturesque , almost poetic , descriptions of things . those descriptions were still there , but they did not connect well . the mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line , not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story . there is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats ' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line . i felt very let down at the end of this audio book
