not for all jewish grandparents this book should have been subtitled `` the art of assimilated jewish grandparenting '' or `` how to keep your granchildren a little bit jewish '' . if you 're looking for a book about that buy it . if you 're looking for a nice book about how to grandparent a nuclear , jewishly oriented family , look elsewhere
