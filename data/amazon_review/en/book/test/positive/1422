educational i am impressed with this book . it 's easy to read and understand , and i learned a lot about the importance of magnesium and how it helps us to function . i have shared this book with friends and family so they can improve their diets and learn how a magnesium deficiency affects their health . my daughter has not had a migraine since she has incorporated this mineral in to her diet . that in itself made the purchase worthwhile . highly recommend
