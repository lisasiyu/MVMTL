great book ! i just finished reading the wizard of ads , and was completely impressed with it on every level . my husband read it first and almost insisted that i read it as well . i 'm glad i did . it was very informative and easy to read as well . before reading this book , i was looking at the online reviews and noticed the one titled `` too religious , too partisan , yuck ! '' or something like that . after reading this book and learning a little bit about roy williams , i feel compelled to respond to his comments . this book is in no way religious , and contains absolutely no political content whatsoever . the person who wrote that review apparently found out that roy williams once had lunch with a conservative governor , and that he might be a christian . he thought that reason enough to call williams `` creepy '' and blast a book which it seems he never even read . then in the middle of his review , this guy starts raling against the bush administration and how he 's responsible for boring tv ads during the super bowl . what ? ? ? this is obviously a bitter person who is just looking for reasons to slam people that might hold views different from his own . but in this case , the criticism could n't be more unwarranted . roy williams has personally trained executives from companies such as proctor and gamble , usa today , and many others . the wizard of ads was named business book of the year , and hit # 1 on both the wall street journal and new york times business best seller list . you will find absolutely no political or religious activism of any kind in this book . what you will find is extremely valuable advice that , if applied , will make your business more profitable .
