not a single false note in coming-of-age novel k.m . soehnlein did not strike a single false note for me in his coming-of-age novel . the non-linear nature of many conversations ( which still communicate much to both the listeners and the speakers ) , the guilt and excitement that a person feels when he continues to experience life during tragic circumstances , the way a series of bold decisions suddenly add up to a life spinning wildly out of control : all of these ring true to me . the protagonist robin mckenzie is destined for greater things than his suburban new jersey town can give him -- he 's smart , creative , and hungry -- but we 're lucky to have a peak into the half-year when his life and identity are transformed ( unfortunately , by an accident when childhood teasing gets out-of-hand ) . the book is written for adults , although older teenagers might be ready for it . i imagine that some high school gays will dog-ear certain hot sections for re-reading . i would have done so had i stumbled on such a book when i was in high school . wait , i did ... **spoiler** and for once in recent fiction , a gay relationship in high school is shown to be the intoxicating , confusing , educational and finite experience that it often is . i look forward to reading more from k.m . soehnlein
