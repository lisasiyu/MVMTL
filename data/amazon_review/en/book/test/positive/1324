politics + fernand braudel style social history . this book is how popular history should be written . it not only covers the famous figures but does some in-depth history of everyday life . incidentally , a type of history pioneered , and done best , by french historian fernand braudel . another reviewer sites zinn as if it is his original style . his works are bad american copies of the work of the french annales school of historical study
