a thoughtful story maybe it is a strange focus for a book of social studies , not just describing how people talk about themselves , but how they talk about each other . in the end , i think this is the most interesting part of the book , what it tells us about the gossip of shanghai people . as a person who grew up in shanghai and left eight years ago , i am drawn to all stories of shanghai out of nostalgia and curiousity for my old home . so i bought this book in the university book store . what i found is an unusual type of story , written by a foreign , well american , man about sex in shanghai . some things he writes are so familiar to me i laughed out loud . others are not what i remember of shanghai . i like best the stories these people tell about their friends . i remembered some of the stories in my street , and it made me laugh
