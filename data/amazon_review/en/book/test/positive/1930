best short , complete book on ancient greece if you do n't know much about ancient greek history or culture , this is the best short book i know of . on every page , in every sentence , the author gets straight to the point , with no fancy obfuscations , assuming no prior knowledge . i 've never seen a better organized history of ancient greece . besides that , i strongly approve of the map selection and the timelines . he gives just enough depth to be a solid introduction -- just a little bit more than `` what you 're supposed to know . '' some teachers i know prefer a book titled `` ancient greece '' written by a team of authors led by sarah pomeroy . it has just a bit more depth than this book , but it is n't nearly as well written . it seems that they wanted it to be easily comprehensible , but i 'm not sure they succeeded . it does have the advantage of a little more depth , but if you 're reading for pleasure , i recommend this one rather than that one . it is , though , only an introduction ; that 's the obvious downside of being short . you might want more information about the culture : more excerpts from the poets , the thoughts of the philosophers described in more detail , more plates ( or plates in color ) about the art . actually the book is amply illustrated in black and white . but of course a book dedicated to greek culture would have better information on any of these aspects , and that would be a book worth reading . this one serves only as an introduction . i strongly recommend reading the norton critical editions of the iliad and odyssey , hesiod , a couple famous tragedies ( in my opinion , euripides ' medea is the one to read first ) , and a few of plato 's more famous dialogues . that is an introduction ; but if that 's the kind of thing you intend to do , this book will be a great place to start . on the historical/political/social matters , this book is again a great introduction , but only an introduction . if you want more detailed information , especially a look at the reasons historians believe such and such happened , i very strongly recommend john v. a . fine 's `` the ancient greeks , '' one of the very best history books i 've ever read . of course it 's a lot longer , but it 's worth it . once again , if you 're reading for pleasure , i recommend this one first , and then fine 's book , which is a bit harder to follow . if you want to read about greek religion , i would once again start here ; but then you should read the classic , walter burkert 's book , and follow it up with jan bremmer 's book , both titled `` greek religion . '' of course , why not a little cheerleading for learning about ancient greece ? since the renaissance and even more since the victorian era , anyone in the west who would call themselves educated has had to have basic knowledge of ancient greece . they were certainly very influential on western culture , and via bactria even had some considerable influence on east asia . i 've found that greek history somehow arouses more curiousity in students than modern european or american history . i think it 's because of the nature of the ancient greeks themselves , because they reflected on human nature via their own history , so as we study ancient greece , we get to reflect on the nature of power , why governments take forms such as aristocracies or democracies or monarchies , why wars are won or lost , why empires rise and fall , how much blood and misery flow through history , and so on . students do n't merely have to memorize lists of events and prepared ideas , but they get to reflect about life , why the world is the way it is , for themselves . and that is what most people , young or old , are all about .
