batchi-guu ! ( ^-^ ) i have n't read the book but i assume it 's the same as the movie . i first saw this movie in japan and i fell in love with it and all following miyazaki movies . he has a gift when it comes to story telling . the characters , with jiji the black cat as my favorite , are unforgettable
