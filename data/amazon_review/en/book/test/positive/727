cranford / knutsford a very quick review . a beautifully written book filled with the feminine niceties and social customs of provincial early 19th century life . a very interesting read to myself as i was born at cranford lodge , knutsford , the true market town in the north of england that gaskell based her novel on . a visit to knutsford itself brings out the flavour of the writing and tours of `` cranford '' including miss matty 's house and the assembly rooms at the george can be arranged through the gaskell society
