comforting this book was a great start to my homeschooling expirience . it goes over all the myths and misconceptions and puts your mind at ease . this book was one of the first books i read about homeschooling and it was really encouraging and comforting . linda dobson writes in an easy to read fashion , like a note from a friend or big sister . i have since bought 3 more of her books and even more from the publishing company 3 rivers press . happy homeschooling !
