a teaching tool for counting from 1-15 , 20,30,40 ... 100 . i liked this book for various reasons . first , i thought it was neat for representing numbers through numerals , words , and dots . it also incorporated street scenes and common objects for the reader to see a certain number of objects in an everyday situation . i also liked how the cover and some pictures showed children of different races together . the only thing negative comment i have is that the pictures are black and white and not as attractive as more current books . i think the book is appropriate and a great way to practice counting
