even better than the first one ! ! i thought that lahaye and blackstock would never be able to duplicate and certainly not be able to top the writing in the 1st book of this series . how wrong i was ! ! this book is even better than the first ! i can now relate even more to the characters of cedar circle , and i feel like they are my best friends . i can hardly wait to turn each page so i can find out what happens next . i am anxiously awaiting the opportunity to read the 3rd book , because i know i wo n't be disappointed
