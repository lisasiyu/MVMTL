excellent book i have been in music industry business for a while now and i would recommand this piece of art to anyone who 's new and seriously wants to become familiar with this industry . whether you 're an artist or manager , this book will help you to understand the basics . i also like the fact that the authors are so honest and give you a real piece of advice if you want to be a successful artist manager , and that is to get education ( especially in business ) . as a recent business graduate it has helped me to be a lot more successful in this industry
