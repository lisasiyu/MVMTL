great book ! this book has a great variety of martini recipes - i 'm usually a fan of basic dirty martinis , but there are so many options for interesting drinks in here , i 'm looking forward to branching out and trying them all . it 's a great book to use if you 're throwing a party , since there are drinks in every color , flavor , and for every season . so far i 've tried the pineapple champagne martini , which was really good . the book also has a ton of really beautiful photos .
