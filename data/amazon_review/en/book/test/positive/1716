this is a great book covering the seam method . i would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking better fit in dressmaking . the seam method of pattern alteration is pretty easy and straightforward . judith presents alterations for the bodice , skirt , and pants . with the information in this book , you can alter your pattern for square or sloping shoulders , wide or narrow hips/waist , thin arms , rounded back , and many other necessary alterations . i did not find the bust alteration to be very helpful to me , however . i prefer other methods , but i often use the seam method for widening my waist and hips in my own patterns . additionally , judith offers style suggestions to flatter various figures . it is an interesting and useful book
