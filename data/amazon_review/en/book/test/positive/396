very profitable reading . i really liked this book . it is a classic book for those who are interested in managing their finances according to biblical principles , and for those who have landed themselves into debt . larry burkett teaches biblical principles of debt-management by telling stories ... stories collected over years of counseling thousands of struggling individuals and couples . some of the previous reviewers have said that these stories are just anecdotal scare-tactics , but the intriguing thing is that i see highly-educated people around me making the same `` anecdotal '' mistakes with their finances ( and reaping the consequences ) . americans ( in general ) have no clue how much house they can afford , etc . and regard debt as a necessary evil ... or even as a good thing . this book helps you to see debt in a more balanced light , and is highly recommended to anyone who struggles in this area . as you can see by some of the other reviews , if you 're not a christian , you 'll probably get hung up on some of the biblical principles : such things like keeping your word even when it costs you money , family leadership principles , living within your means , and the husband-wife relationship . so if you 're not a christian , i would suggest taking a serious look at the bible ( by studying what it says ) and then compare it to the principles in this book . i think you 'll find that the bible is reliable and timeless in its guidelines for finances just as it is for every other area of life
