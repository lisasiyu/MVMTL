interesting time , interesting place this novel tells the haunting story of two generations of a wisconsin family brought together and torn apart by the lake adjacent to the family home . focused on four women , sisters of two generations , the novel develops around the sisters ' relationship with the lake , and the tragedy that ensues when it claims one of their lives . much of the book is spent untangling the secrets which led to the drowning , and working out the complicated problems which arise from the family 's attempts to keep these secrets . scwartz 's story jumps back and forth across time , from past to present and back again . this means that the story develops piece by piece , and this is what makes it something of a mystery . i found the plot development to be one of the more satisfying parts of this book , seeing the pieces of the puzzle fall into place . i enjoyed the developments leading up to scwartz 's telling of what actually happened the night of the tragedy . after that point , however , i found the plot to be something of a let-down . the conclusion seemed a bit too neat , and a bit forced . the most enjoyable part of this book to me was the way in which scwartz set the scene- the way in which she managed to capture the sense of a time and place . the novel is set in the wisconsin countryside in the first half of the twentieth century , with most of the action focusing on the last years of wwi , and the 1920s . scwartz offers a convincing portrait of wisconsin farm country in the late-1910s and early 1920s . her descriptions are vivid , without being overstated , and her story intersects with several significant historical events , including wwi and the influenza epidemic . scwartz gives her readers a strong sense of connection to the seasons , the land , the lake . i really did feel like i was part of the world about which she wrote . overall , i enjoyed reading this novel . the development of the plot engaged me , and the scenery captivated me . i was a bit disappointed by the ending , but my reading was by and large time well spent .
