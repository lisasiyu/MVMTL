`` hooked on art '' - teachers guide for grades kindergarten-sixth this book is of great use for elementary school teachers . i got a copy when it was first published several years ago and have given several copies to teachers . when teaching elementary school students , as i did , things must be kept simple . this is not only true because of the availability of supplies but , also , the ability of the students and supervision needed in teaching the art process . the author had years of teaching experience and it shows in the instructions given - - - particularly , for those of us who do n't have a great artistic talent ourselves . i purchased my most recent copy for a young friend who is starting her first year of teaching in the fourth grade . i hope that she uses it and enjoys it
