an easy read i recently bought this book and found it to be very easy to read , rather than just have lists of grammatical tables like some books i have seen . the author recommends helpful websites throughout the book and makes use of 200 short passages that can be read as you go . all grammar is covered in the beginning chapters , and the following ones are devoted to metre , poetic style , grammar of poetry , how to read old english manuscripts , spelling variants , phonetics , and then an anthology of texts . the glossary is full of translations of every word used in the texts . i think this book is excellent for the beginner who wants to gain a sound overview of the language
