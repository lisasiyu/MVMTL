`` apocalypse '' is a big help i 've heard several different interpretations of the book of revelation in the bible , but this one breaks the book down into its respective chapters/verses . it 's easy to get caught up in all the `` fear and dread '' that seems to come from many sources and it 's great to read something that is more direct . the author does n't claim to have complete understanding , but does clarify some of the mystical language and symbolism . this book will be a wonderful resource for our religious education classes .
