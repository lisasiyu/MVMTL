entertaining read i was in the mood for an fast entertaining read , and this book filled the bill . actually , i read it years ago , and recently re-read it . it 's suspenseful with a nice touch of romance . i am not going to argue with other posters who say the characters were not fleshed out or the plot was unbelievable . i enjoyed the story and the resourcefulness of the characters , and the constant sense of impending danger . i was n't looking for a literary exploration of the human condition , just a fun read with likable characters and a fast-paced plot , and this is it
