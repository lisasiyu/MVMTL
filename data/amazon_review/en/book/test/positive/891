a good compliment to the `` myth america '' tv series . as with most tv series you get statements with out support . so i tracked down the richard shenkiman book to get some background to the statements about american myths . i was not disappointed . it is as if he was reading this book on the tv with more graphic representations for the different media . the book is worth reading . however the format may not be to some peoples liking as it is short choppy statements and the chapters are divided into subjects as , discoverers and inventors , presidents , sex , and art . there is a fair set of footnotes to lead you to further reading . you may need this as he sometimes stretches a point . final analysis , you are better off reading this to give a better perspective on reality . read it to your kids and save them a lifetime of `` legends , lies & cherished myths of american history '' .
