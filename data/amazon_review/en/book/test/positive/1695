an exciting and thrilling read i give this outing of the amelia peabody emerson novels five stars simply because it was a heck of a good story , a thrilling ride , and the ending came out of blue . as with the last few books in this series the violence directed at the emerson family becomes more dangerous than it ever has been . people are being shot , prostitutes are murdered , and members of the emerson clan are put in extreme , dangerous positions . what the author seems to be doing is showing what a family living in and working in egypt might have to deal withat this point in history : egyptian nationalistic movements , british prejudices , and the rumblings of wwi ( minus the mystery high-jixs and master criminals , of course ) . the one annoying factor in this novel was nefret . the author has chosen to take a once strong and intelligent young woman and turn her into a petty , childish , lovelorn twit who not only makes bad choices that put the family in greater danger , but also breaks the heart of nearly every member of the family . ramses also had his annoying moments . he has always been a favorite character , but since attaining adulthood he 's become a brooding , self-righteous , and insulting young man with a real `` superman '' syndrome . again , i 'm allowing myself to become too invested in the lives of fictional characters , but that 's the hallmark of a great author . one of the bright spots and little used aspects of this novel is david and his new wife lia . much of this novel revolves around accusations against david and his late grandfather , abdullah , so i wish he could have played a larger role , but he does become a major focal point of the novel near the end . i just wish the author would allow this character to step into the limelight more instead of being little more than ramses ' shadow . overall , this was an exciting and thrilling edition of the emerson clan adventures and i strongly recommend the novel
