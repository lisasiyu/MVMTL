great book for a beginning bender ! i purchased this book because i was interested in getting into circuit bending to create my own new instruments to use in tandem with our laptop-driven experimental music project . this book is great , even if you 're not already an electronics geek . very simple and direct . also , reed ghazala has a totally appreciable geeky sense of humour . i was laughing out loud as i was learning . i recommend this book strongly to anyone interested in getting into circuit bending .
