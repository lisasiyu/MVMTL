the weird underbelly of an intellectual pastime j.c. hallman 's the chess artist is structured around a trip that the author took with his friend glenn , the chess player of the book 's title , to kalmykia , a crumbling russian republic on the northwest shore of the caspian sea . hallman was interested in interviewing kalmykia 's despotic president , kirsan ilyumzhinov , a former chess prodigy and the president of the world chess federation ( fide ) , who was using chess `` as a tool to unify and mollify his people . '' ( he had made chess instruction compulsory in schools , for example . ) woven around the story of their journey are chapters on chess history -- its development and geographical migration across a thousand years , the history of its individual pieces -- and hallman 's further adventures with glenn : marathon chess sessions over the internet , formal chess competitions , blindfolded chess and speed chess , chess played in prison and in princeton , and the various characters they ran across on their adventures -- child prodigies and the denizens of dickensian chess shops and the down-and-out chess hustlers of new york 's washington square park . part travelogue , then , and part history , hallman 's book is also an exploration of both the international subculture of competitive chess and of his traveling companion . for most of the period covered by the book , glenn was ranked as a chess master -- exceptionally good but well below the grandmasters who form the true elite of the chess world . glenn is an enigmatic character . a germophobic 39-year-old with a genius for the game and poor grammar , he is apparently incapable of consistently making smart decisions in the real world . divorced and perpetually broke , almost childish at times , his friendship seems to be to a great extent a burden . hallman has a tendency , actually , to write about glenn as if he were a sort of lab animal , whose mannerisms and mode of play are alike under scrutiny . `` he shrugged and performed a gesture that was new to me , opening his palms suddenly and at the same time contorting his face to an expression of exaggerated surprise . '' annoying and strange , given to marking promising relationships with ceremonial whistling , glenn is also a sad figure , a broken man `` spiraling toward nothingness , a waste of twenty years of effort and energy . '' one wonders what glenn thought of his presentation in the book . the chess artist is very well researched and thick with information . and it is punctuated by some truly wonderful , sometimes poetic writing : `` the train was all lullaby , the gyroscopic jostle of the tracks , the steady click of the wheels like the eighth notes of some slower melody , the stars stationary out the small window , all of it a lull of travel nostalgia , a cradle or warm womb , glenn and i like twins incubating in that cramped space . '' in kalmykia hallman is served `` a genocide of crayfish '' ; in a prison cafeteria the fare is instead `` hockey pucks of meat like the leftover scrapings of a botched autopsy . '' one chess player they observe has the `` eyebrows of a demon , '' while another is `` a nondescript man who fit the profile of a serial killer -- short , well-groomed , quiet , and very dangerous . '' hallman 's writing is riddled with such evocative descriptions . this is both wonderful and , surprisingly perhaps , problematic : the problem is that hallman tends to lavish his well-written descriptions on nearly every minor character who crosses his path , so that the reader is met with too much information . hallman 's flair is obvious . but after a time , the personalities in the book tend to blend together . it is tempting to say that hallman does for chess what stefan fatsis does for scrabble in his book word freak , exposing the weird underbelly of an intellectual pastime , the obsessives who sacrifice sleep and hygiene over their chosen game . hallman 's book , though , is a more serious and more difficult read . presumably , the more familiar a reader is with chess , the more he will get out of the book . i myself do not play , but i was able to understand and appreciate , at least on some level , most of what the author had to say . non-chess players should not be afraid of diving in . debra hamel -- author of trying neaira : the true story of a courtesan 's scandalous life in ancient greece ( yale university press , 2003
