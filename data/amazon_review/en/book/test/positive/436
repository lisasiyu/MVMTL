best c++ reference i used the first edition of stroustrip 's the c++ programming language until it was dog-eared and the binding fell apart . i 'm glad that this edition is hard-backed so i wo n't wear it out . c++ is a complex language and it 's impossible to write a program of any size in c++ without a good reference on your desk . i have not found any other c++ reference that is as complete or as useful as this book . this is not an introduction to c++ but rather a reference book . i learned c++ from lippman 's c++ primer but that 's on my bookshelf and stroustrip is on my desk .
