finger lickin ' good this book has absolutely fantastic recipes - all the favorites and then some ! my husband and i make a lot of these `` clones '' regularly . particular hits are the kfc honey bbq wings and the baskin robbins ice cream cake . great for get-togethers or when you 're having a craving at home
