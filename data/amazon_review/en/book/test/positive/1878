an easy to read useful book and not only for business i always thought i was good at communication until i read this book ( text book really ) . i was particularly impressed by the examples of emails that on the surface look fine until the writer points out the loop holes . despite its title this book comes in hand for many situations well outside business . i have also used my newly acquired skills in academic , political and philanthropic forums and received very positive feedback from colleagues who noticed a change . buy this book
