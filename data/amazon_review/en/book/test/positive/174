a rare perspective that demands a hearing this book really helped coalesce in my mind that sometimes it 's not the party , it 's the man . by serving presidents from both parties , gergen forces republican and democratic readers to set aside their party loyalty to confront the reality that both parties have had recent presidential successes and failures . for example , i was a proud reagan youth who did n't vote for clinton in 1992 however , by 1996 i had to admit that clinton was doing an excellent job of leading the country in spite of my party 's obstructionist activities that only hurt the country . gergen explains how clinton was able to overcome and succeed in spite of opponents intent on political destruction rather than serving their country . gergen also provides excellent examples of what many of us realized by 1984 about reagan , that while his rhetoric mainly appealed to the conservative right , reagan was truly a president to all americans and governed from the middle . if are you interested in presidential politics and care more about the country than you do about your party , this is a great case study . if you are a senior manager responsible for large numbers of people , this book is also an excellent manual on managerial success using your own style and approach . if you are looking for ammunition to do battle against ideological opponents , this is not the book for you
