a must read what an amazing account of a surgeon 's life ! i loved this book . starkly honest , the writer does not spare herself . gripping , heartrending accounts of former patients and the training of a surgeon . i could n't put it down . why are n't all surgeons so caring ? some of the reasons are explained in this book
