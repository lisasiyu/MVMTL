neat ! this game is great for young computer-users ! each page has at least 15 & quot ; interactions & quot ; -- i.e . clicking on the salt shakers in the kitchen makes them dance . the story can read itself to you are you can read it silently . even clicking on one word makes the computer say it . great for children just learning to read . however , using it too many times can get tiring ... after all , it is just a computerized book . great value for the money
