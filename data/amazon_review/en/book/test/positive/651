incredible reference book and work of art . no pagan , witch , occulist , magickian or philosopher should be without this book . there is no excuse . this is the most phoenomenal book of its kind . jmg must have spent years creating this . i have never found a more helpful , clear yet complete guide for the occult sciences and all things pagan . this cleared more things up for me than many other books ever could . this is brilliant . pick up a copy ; you will be thrilled that you did
