open minded as i possibly could be ! i give this book 4 stars because i still have alot of questions and skepticism in some of the wildly , new to me , ideas in this book . i like sylvia brown 's deep sense of spirituality and her abilities have convinced me she is real at what she does . i do n't think she is trying to fool anyone . i am a seeker and am approaching the things she talks about in this book with as much an open mind as i possibly can be . the chapter on the lost continent of atlantis was the chapter that was pushing me the most . although i do believe there is life in the universe beyond our own the atlantis story is really out there . of course , i have not done any reading about this subject before so who am i to judge it . there maybe very similar views in other books about atlantis and her explaination did make sense when compared the ages of people of atlantis to those in the book of genesis reaching in the 800 and 900 yrs old . from crystal skulls to loch ness monster to spontaneous human combustion it is all an interesting and fun read ! ! but if you buy this book you will have to take what you can use and just leave the rest
