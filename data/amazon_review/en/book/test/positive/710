another excellant book by pat pat uses a lot of history in this book to get his point across , thus if you like history it is quite good , but be warned that if you do n't like to read history , you may find yourself skimming through parts of the book where the history is particularly heavy , but he gets his point across.this is not to say this is a history book , but there is a lot of history reading in this book.this book is an excellant example of showing how we have gone too far trying to protect the world
