addicted to this cookbook i learned about debra ponzek from a nick jr . newsletter at my child 's daycare center in connecticut . i tried her cowboy cookies recipe from the article and i was hooked on ponzek . it 's pretty cool that she is a connecticut resident as well . i love the fact that recipes are kid-friendly with adult appeal . no smiley faced plates , ... just yummy food . i 've only had the cookbook for 3 weeks and have enjoyed the following recipes : tuna , pasta & celery salad , fresh mayo , spinach salad with dried cherries , almonds , & blue cheese , ham , cheddar & tom quesadillas , arugula and proscuitto pizza , aux delices marinara , rigatoni with ricotta , tomato , and basil , two simple sauces of basil-lemon pesto and sweet tom marmalade which i served with pan-seared tilapia , and vegetable fried rice . my hands-down fave has been the pizza . the aux delice sauce is my fave to date & i 've made many from the food tv network chefs
