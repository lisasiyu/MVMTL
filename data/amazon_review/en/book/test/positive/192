tedious , meandering , but worth the effort noll identifies twelve `` turning points '' in the history of christianity , times at which the faith struck off in a distinctly different direction from that which it had been traveling . he seeks to set forth the significance of each turning point and set it in its proper place in the broad sweep of history . you can not argue with his first few choices , although he seems to read more consequence into the events than may be warranted . the fall of jerusalem was indeed a watershed event , but noll sees its significance in the formation of canon , clergy , and creed . these three things formed after the fall , and would have formed quite differently but for the fall , but were not the direct result of the fall . the main significance of the fall is that it freed christianity from its status as a sect of judaism . until jerusalem fell , the premier church of christianity was the jerusalem church . the jerusalem church considered itself a sect of judaism . until the death of the jerusalem church , all christians everywhere would feel constrained to follow its lead . one must wonder whether it was the council of nicaea or the battle of the milvian bridge that was the second turning point in christian history . nevertheless , the nicene creed 's significance can not be overstated . the next turning point , the council of chalcedon , `` settled '' christ 's nature . although there is still disagreement among various christian denominations , most still adhere to the doctrine of christ hammered out at chalcedon . later `` turning points '' are more debatable . charlemagne 's coronation may or may not have laid the foundation for christendom . you could make an excellent case for the proposition that we have constantine , not charlemagne , to thank for christendom . some `` turning points '' are n't so much turning points as symptoms of greater movements within christian history . the english act of supremacy , which was basically an act of convenience for an heirless king , was more symptom than turning point , as were the french revolution and the ministry of wesley . noll makes this amply clear in the chapters devoted to those `` turning points . '' his most intriguing chapter is the last , as he maps out the survival of christianity under communist repression and the explosion of christianity in africa and south america . this last phenomenon goes far to set at naught the arguments of those who see christianity as irrelevant in the postmodern world
