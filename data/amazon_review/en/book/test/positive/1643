a real page turner i can remember telling people to leave me alone in the lunch room as i read through the final quarter of this book . while this book does feature some hannibal lecter moments , it is more centered around the search for a serial killer , with hannibal once again providing the 'consultant ' role . the movie did a fairly sucessful job with this up until the end , which was saddening ; the ending in this book is quite a powerhouse , although similar in them . this is a very compelling read whether you are a horror fan or crime fan . there is alot of technical forensic stuff here and there , but it works well as you follow the closing in on a really sick guy . the romance element here is quite strong and tragic ; it provides a nice distraction from the constant tension you feel throughout these pages . i was very impressed with this book , and it had me hanging on every last word . i ca n't imagine anyone who likes this kind of stuff feeling any differently
