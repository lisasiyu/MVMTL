recommended for me , there are two key assertions in robert adams ' `` beauty in photography '' . first , that we `` live in discouraging hours of society 's apparent decay '' ( p. 88 ) . second , that the purpose of art is to `` help us meet our worst fear , the suspicion that life may be chaos and that therefore our suffering is without meaning '' ( p. 25 ) . from these two assertions adams develops his interpretation of photography : photography detects , extracts and emphasizes the beauty around us , and by doing so it points toward something deeper in the world , an organizing power , a coherence supporting the world and our lifes . to adams , photography is a spiritual exercise , making bearable an otherwise decaying sourrounding . art not concerned with depicting the world beautifully is , to adams , mere `` decoration '' . thus , adams tells us little interesting about most modern art , and his approach does not generalize , for instance , to music . that beauty can exist as such , that it can tell us something about ourselves even without refering to things in the world : this does not seem to be adams experience . in these very conservative views i disagree with adams . still , i recommend his essays to anyone who wants to understand why some photography is moving us while other is not . even if adams is not telling the whole story -probably nobody will- he is an excellent writer who talks about art in a clear and understandable way . the only disappointment with the book was the poor reproduction quality of the images depicted . as a publisher specializing in photography books aperture could do better
