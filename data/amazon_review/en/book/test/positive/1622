terrific book ! this is a great book . it not only gives a feel for life after the end of the show ds9 , but very creatively incorporates the time frames and characters from the eras of dax 's previous hosts . e.g . bomes makes an appearance . highly recommended if you loved the dax character , or star trek in general
