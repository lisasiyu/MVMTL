facts you did n't know about hitler i 'm somewhat of an history buff , especially wwii , but when my mom bought me this book at a yard sale , i did n't know what i was in store for upon reading it . there are lots of little known facts about hitler 's secrets and his personal life . we get a glimpse inside of hitler 's head to see what makes him tick - it was n't just his hatred of the jews that drove him . the book was just a conglomeration of interesting information , and contains many rare photos . if you like reading about hitler or similar topics , this book is worth buying
