truly interesting and unconventional stories i teach short-story writing , and i 've had my students read this book because it shows that there is still a way to & quot ; make it new & quot ; in the story form . arvin 's stories , all of them , have nice surprises in form or content . he is not satisfied with cliches or overused word or character packages . his historical pieces do n't smack of research , but present a complex world with compelling characters . the stories are not of interest to solely writers ; they 're compelling to anyone who cares about the human heart . i look forward to reading his novel , articles of war , which i 've heard is coming out from doubleday in january 2005
