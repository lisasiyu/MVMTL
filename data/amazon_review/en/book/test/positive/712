outstanding this book is beautifully written . even in translation , i was amazed by how gorgeous pamuk 's prose is . some sentences from this book lingered in my head for days afterward . the main character , ka , is a poet , and the novel itself seemed very poetic to me , but not at all in a dense or difficult way . indeed , `` snow '' flows so smoothly that i would say it 's a fairly easy read . i was n't sure if i would like this book at first because i did n't think i was particularly interested in islam and politics . i discovered that `` snow '' is primarily about god , love , beauty , happiness , death , life , and loneliness . while all the action takes place in a tiny turkish village , the themes are broad , sweeping , vast . this book will not grow dated any time soon , if ever .
