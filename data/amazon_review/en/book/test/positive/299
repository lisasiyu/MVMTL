cat 's cradle - vonnegut 's absurd masterpiece kurt vonnegut 's `` cat 's cradle '' is the story of a man , jonah , who is writing about the `` end of the world , '' or the day when the atom bomb was dropped . his work on the book encourages him to go on many journeys which ultimately leave him in a somewhat ironic yet very comedic position . the story features an imaginative religion , a scientific potion , and a far off society as part of vonnegut 's many bizarre episodes . jonah , researches the `` father of the atom bomb '' and his children in order to determine what they were doing on the day the atom bomb was dropped . seemingly against his will , jonah gets pulled into a plethora of discoveries about the children and their father which he never could have imagined to be true . his journeys ultimately land him , along with the children , on a secluded island with a radically different society from their own . i did in fact enjoy reading this book because of the absurdity and the unbelievable voyages which the main character undergoes . however , it is in fact vonnegut 's style that makes the book so enjoyable . he is able to bring the reader into this world where virtually anything can happen which then leaves the reader totally unaware and clueless as to what comes next . the world allows him to describe such things as the discovery of the island of san lorenzo in a two page account where six different countries claim and forget about the nation before escaping african slaves finally claims the land for good . it is through vonnegut 's voice and style that the reader may not stop to consider such oddities as this one . originally , i chose to read this book after finishing vonnegut 's `` slaughterhouse five , '' and was absolutely taken away by the combination of absurdity and hilariousness through which he expresses himself in this book . though i did not expect this book to be as far out as the alien adventure in `` slaughterhouse five , '' it did seem like a pleasant offbeat satire about modern man . in the end i enjoyed this book more than `` slaughterhouse five '' because of the comedic voice that i found more visible in `` cat 's cradle . '' though the first was rather ridiculous and interesting , for me it did nothing more than provoke thoughts about where such an idea would come from , rather than make me laugh . i would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking an imaginative and far off satirical story that is sure to create a smile . while many may think the story to be boring and pointless , it is partly this hollowness that makes it so enjoyable . the reader is baffled and unable to understand why things happen the way they do creating a randomness that i have found to be attractive . for those readers that were bored by part of the book and decided to put it down forever , i would encourage you to fight through the beginning . after all , i did in fact at first believe that this would be a serious account of the day the atom bomb was dropped , until the bokonon religion was further explained and glorified
