a good book , with one reservation . not only is this a very thorough book , but it is available from amazon 's 'new & used ' sources for quite a low price , considering how recently it was published . i recieved a hard cover edition for 5.94 ! i only have one complaint : most of ilg 's promotional photos on-line show him using an elaborate system of yoga blocks , presumably to enhance the forms ' effectiveness . i was quite interested in this aspect of his training , and was , ( i feel , rightfully ) , assuming that the book would elaborate in this direction . unfortunately , there is no mention whatsoever of the blocks and their uses here in the book . why
