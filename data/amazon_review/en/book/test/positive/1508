a cherished read by reading this book i began to admire bobby jones , not so much for his golf but for his character and his strength in making it to the end . it would have been a lot easier for him in a folklore sense if he had died young instead of being tortured with a crippling , painful disease that challenged him physically and was a test to him mentally and emotionally . i admire that he never hid himself away like so many famous people do that want to be remembered as they `` were '' . i believe that this is the most admirable thing about him . that and his willingness to serve in wwii , landing on the same beach the day after d-day . not just a `` for show '' tour of duty . his devotion to his family , his country and his friends and his hometown are quite amazing . he is a role model in many ways that i do n't even think of golf as one of them but for his tenaciousness , his intellect , his well roundedness and his extreme graciousness . he could have derailed many times but he never did in life . it 's a loss that there is n't more to read about his life to know how he managed to adjust to everyday life and his illness , how he kept putting one foot in front of the other . the criticism seems unjust re : chick evans , jones was very kind in all his correspondence to him which i have read in other books . also , so much is made of his temper which he defends and explains in `` down the fairway '' by jones , as not worse than any other player of the time and shortlived as a childish display that was never witnessed again at least publically for the rest of his life . bobby jones accomplished an amazing number of feats that most of us would feel proud to do even one of such as the many languages he spoke , the degrees , his many intellectual skills , a good family man and most of all his grace in a life
