intersectionality as described by maya angelou in her autobiographical novel , i know why the caged bird sings , maya angelou recounts her life story as a young , keenly intelligent but insecure black girl in the south during the 1930s and california during the 1940s . the book conveys the difficulties associated with the mixture of racial and gender discrimination endured by a southern black girl , though , and this is perhaps the most fundamental theme explored in her autobiography . the intersectionality of race and gender is a pivotal thread of angelou 's theme , where more than one type of subjugation results in a multiple burden for the victim . overall , i know why the caged bird sings is a powerful , stirring account of the intersectionality of race and gender regarding black women . though segregation had been officially declared null and void , many of the southern states were steeped in racist tendencies that further multiplied the gender inequality that exposed black women to a multi-faceted oppression . peiss , hine , terborg-penn , bederman , et . al . all examine threads of this intersectionality , and in discussing these threads , one can draw a distinct comparison between anti-black , anti-black women sentiment and angelou 's personal experiences . as a girl , angelou believed her gender to be a limiting factor . she considered herself to be unheroic , and incapable of achieving spectacular feats like the boys in her comic books . in the narrative , being female for angelou is just as trying as being black , and she struggled with the double burden , rather than embracing it . however , as more and more black women slowly overcame their troubles as a result of the overwhelming intersectionality of the time , so did angelou . the novel ended with hope because she bucks the stereotype to become the first black female streetcar conductor . angelou 's spike in confidence and belief in her ability reflects the gradual evolution of black women 's race and gender after decades of imprisonment , and foreshadows a future of activism , struggle for respect and eventual victory in those regards .
