pretty great book i liked the stories and thought they were entertaining and erotic , but i think they could have gone a little further into true eroticism , and less further into simple vulgarity.it 's not often that i like every story in any book with several , but that 's just what happened with this book . i really did enjoy each and every story . it contains enough stories that at least several almost undoubtedly will hit with each reader . this book was great fun and never once even tried to convince me , the reader , that it was anything more than a collection of stories designed to excite and titillate . but this one remains my favorite.the book includes some really good writers too
