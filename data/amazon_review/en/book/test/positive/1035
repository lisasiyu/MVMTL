auntie mame , low country style here is a book to hold to your heart , it is that good . and before i even get to the fun , lively and irresistible plot , let me just say that we know on page one that miss lavinia , our own low country auntie mame , has passed away . and yet at the end , when we have finished getting to know her and attend her death and funeral , i was crying like a baby . and i do n't cry at books ! ! the plot to this book is true to dotty frank 's genre : displaced low country gal comes home , gets mesmerized , and slowly regains her roots . in this case , the woman is caroline wimbley levine , married to a cold and smug psychiatrist , richard , and living in equally cold luxury in new york with their beloved son eric . when caroline hears from her brother trip that their mother , lavinia , is losing her marbles and must be put in assisted living , caroline grabs eric and goes home for what she thinks will be for a few days . and there she is caught up in the gullah magic ; the low country mystique ( in which i thoroughly believe , thanks to dotty 's wonderful books ) and a chance to become , once again , the `` real '' caroline . this might be the best of the four books dotty frank has so-far written . i can not praise it highly enough . grab it and lose yourself in a truly wonderful read
