before you judge.. get the other 's shoes on ... seierstad writes a compelling book about cultural and personal differences . i actually can read between the lines the efforts of a man who is trying to find his own voice in a system that does not work as we think . with seierstad 's candid observations , one might feel compelled to shout and scream ... but yet any body who does not have the opportunity to stand out and taste criticism will shield from taking actions . i loved the way the author was able to clearly state facts and jumped into her emotions ( and i can only imagine the shock ) . most people will fail to recognize the main character 's effor to provide for an honorable way of living , help his younger wife to read , and do his best . when we read the book without judgement , we are able to understand how we differ . i actually think i can understand why this or that happens.. reconstruction after war is hard , anybody who has had to live and survive a very strict regime builds up character or shuts down . i usually found myslef thinking what would i do as any of the character 's personalities emerged ... it was fascinating . i smiled at the young teenager boy ... thinking of my brother , then my son.. of my feminist father and how he would try to emancipate his daughters and truly believe the guy is making a difference in his culture which might be less shocking than if we took someone from our culture to make drastic changes . the insecurity portraid by the female characters also happens to so many people ( mostly woman who chose to stay at home to care for kids for a while ) who leave the competitive world to nurture others . but most importantly , the book is a gift of courage on everyone.. to tell how they see it , and not pretending to live in a perfect world . i admire their courage , from the comfort of my house , with water and electricity , glass windows and no fear that i 'll get bombed . i could n't put it down ... if you want a total shock , read it with 'emergency sex ' ( and other desperate measures
