enjoyed it then and just enjoyed it again ! i read this one for the first time in 1959 , a year after it was published . this story has never left me . for some reasone it left quite an impression . recently i ran across a copy at a book sale and purchased it , took it home and read it again . i now know why it has stayed with me all these year ! it is good ! i have , over the years read quite a number of heinlein 's works and i must admit that this is probably my favorite of the bunch . i realize that it is considered a juvenile book and it is certainly an appropriate read for the younger reader , but , as i just found out , it is quite a nice read for the older reader also . as i remember , looking back , this book rather inspired me in many ways , and doing better in school was by no means the least . some of heinlein 's later work was rather difficult for me to digest , i.e . i simply did not like them . i rather wish he had stuck to simply telling well told tales as he did with this one . recommend this one highly .
