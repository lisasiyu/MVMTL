size matters , and so does censorship ! now this is how the art of tom of finland should be represented ... in a volume large enough for us to appreciate the great detail in his work . unfortunately , the people at taschen and the tom of finland foundation found it necessary to re-release this wonderful volume in a smaller , cheaper version , and that trend has only gotten worse with the recent release of tom 's `` comic collection '' - which i reviewed negatively only to see that entire title withdrawn from amazon in less that 24 hours after my review appeared ... so to read that review , you 'll have to click `` see all my reviews '' . is n't censorship , especially in the erotic art world , a real pity ! -- click on `` see all my reviews
