take a deep breath and connect the dots prepare to start hyperventilating as you read this book if you have only been exposed to the `` official '' version of 9/11 . read it , and you may never again be able to stomach the words `` war on terror . '' without throwing bricks , without partisan pot-shots , dr. griffin methodically lays out evidence which overwhelmingly suggests u.s. government complicity in the 9/11 attacks . yet , to his credit , all the author asks for is a genuine , in-depth , and independent investigation . ( the 9/11 commission provided nothing of the sort , but that 's the topic of his next book , `` the 9/11 commission report : omissions and distortions '' ) part of what makes `` the new pearl harbor '' compelling is that it cites so many reports from mainstream media -- newsweek , the washington post , the new york times , etc . quotes from these `` reliable '' sources appear in copious endnotes that together create a pattern . major media just has n't connected the dots . ( this , perhaps , is because its owned by people and corporations who profit handsomely from war . ) but in crime-busting 101 , we learn to suspect those who benefit most from a crime . could our government be so monstrous as to sacrifice 3,000 of its own citizens to secure hundreds of billions of dollars in war funding for many years to come ? our military trains leaders to think in terms of `` cost benefit . '' securing a new american century of `` full-spectrum domination , '' to them , may be the prize that justifies such an atrocity . these and many other questions beg serious probing , not knee-jerk ridicule and dismissive labels like `` unpatriotic . '' read this book , pass it on , and demand that congress start answering questions ; many of the official aspects of 9/11 simply do n't add up
