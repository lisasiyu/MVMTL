a guide for mercury retrograde , a handbook for life . i 've been surprised and enriched through reading mercury retrograde . the writing is both interesting and informative , and ms. peay 's prose are beautiful . i purchased the book shortly before the start of mercury retrograde , and was amazed how frequently i had experiences that the author asserts are typical during this period . not only does ms. peay offer suggestions and advice for living during mr , but her observations can be carried through the rest of the year !
