a real classic when i was growing up , my mother told me that she had been given this book by a beau , had read it and enjoyed it . this was in the early 1900s ! when i saw it in a used book store about a year ago , i picked it up . i am just now reading it . i was totally surprised to find that it is beautifully written , presents a wonderful picture of a vanished time and people and is funny . i find myself smiling at the phrases that have become cliches - & quot ; when you call me that smile. & quot ; and at the fact that i am getting as much pleasure from reading it as my mother did all those years ago
