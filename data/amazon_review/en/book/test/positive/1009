the crumbling wall against tyranny : a/k/a the united states the crumbling wall against tyranny is the most interesting book that i 've ever seen on the american revolution , our sytem of government , and the current state of affairs . the book is authorative , yet humorous at times . complicated legal concepts are explained in terms that i , a mere high school/trade school grad , can easily understand . i was particularly impressed with the authors ability to relate experiences of growing up in a small town to our national government ( chapters 8 & 9 ) . i , too , grew up in such a small town , albeit my small town was 500 miles away and considerably colder , yet it seemed the same as my little town . in summary , i was very impressed with `` the crumbling wall against tyranny '' and i would recommend it to any one interested in american government especialy the parents of students who are studying or will be studying the constituion .
