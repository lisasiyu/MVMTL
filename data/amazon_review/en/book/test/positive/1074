i have never encountered a more perfect review book i never took a psychology course in my life , but one day , for some reason or another , i decided to take the ap psychology exam . i picked up this book , read it throughly and took the tests at the back . on test day , i was literally laughing because the test was exactly the material presented in the barron 's book . i breezed through effortlessly and got a 5 . i would like to extend my sincere thanks to the makers of this book- i can not tell you my appreciation , and i applaud your production of an outstanding review book . if you truly know every concept in this book , i can not , in anyway , foresee a score less than a 5. by the way , the tests at the back of the book are slightly more complicated than the real thing , so do n't be alarmed if you miss 10 or 15 ... keep in mind i was laughing on test day . thank you barron '
