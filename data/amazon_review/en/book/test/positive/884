a stellar book about the possibility of a `` good death '' i think i 've now bought 6 copies of this book , for my own library , to lend to people who are interested and might benefit , and to give as empathy gifts to friends and relatives entering hospice , or their grieving families after a loved one 's death . i have stage iv - advanced , terminal or incurable ( take your pick ) breast cancer . i 've been in treatment , continually adjusting as best as i can to new treatments , new worries and new symptoms , trying to preserve as good a quality of life as possible along the way . meanwhile , final gifts has helped me accept and move towards the idea of quality of death being an important event for me and those i love . once i give up treatment , or treatment fails me ( whichever comes first ) , i 've arranged for a local hospice organization to help my husband and i cope , at home . having read final gifts , it was easier for me to go ahead with planning my graveside funeral according to my culture and preferences , to hire a local stone cutter to design my headstone together - he has since completed it , other than the date of death , so it will be ready to mark my gravesite a week after i 'm buried , and even to write my own obituary ( to the extent that i know the information ) . all this is done , a relief - even a pleasure , to have had a say beforehand , and final gifts , which i and then my husband read over a year ago , provided the impetus , and the hope for a death with dignity and beauty
