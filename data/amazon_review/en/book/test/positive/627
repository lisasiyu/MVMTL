meaning of epiplectic my dad bought me this wonderful little book when i was young , & i have always loved the truly off-center humor of it . in response to the query about the meaning of epiplectic , i found a quick online search produced the same type of results as reviewer rhs got -- mostly references to epileptic & apoplectic . oddly , i have a clear memory of looking it up decades ago ( one of my father 's favorite admonitions was `` look it up ! '' ) and finding a definition that related it to apoplectic , and described it as referring to something that suddenly and somewhat violently falls to pieces . in fact i have often cited 'epiplectic ' as an apt description when watching the blues brothers ' faithful retired police car burst into bits once they make daley plaza , lol -- so this definition , though unconfirmable at the moment , has been clearly emblazoned in my memory for these many years ( right or not ) ! now if i could just find that dictionary of my dad 's to confirm..
