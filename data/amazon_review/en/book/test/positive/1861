the real deal i have been a sci-fi/fantasy reader for over 30 years . this book blew me away . the characters were `` fully fleshed out . '' the plot , which would have come off as inane in less capable hands , resonates with , well , reality . that 's it ! emma bull got me to buy in to this story line - with all the `` diversity '' in the fey - and yes ! it works . i enjoyed it . i loved the love story of eddi and the phouka . all in all , a great , fun read . what more can you ask for
