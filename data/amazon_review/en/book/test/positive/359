excellent insight into the artist stan really did keep and care for james and his family , including when james briefly returned to ireland to establish an art cinema chain leaving his family in italy . excellent insight into the brilliant writer by his also brilliant brother . please read this book for greater understanding and afection for the specifics of joyce 's work ( how stan was pictured in the story a painful case ) , although the view of the universal themes grows dim as we can no longer see the woods for the trees essential to any complete james joyce bookshelf and a wonderful and grateful gift for any member of the fervent joycean faith
