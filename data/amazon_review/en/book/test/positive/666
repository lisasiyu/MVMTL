you will laugh out loud i laughed out loud while i read this book . i was surprised that it is so slim , yet each story is packed with humor . the reader can not help but enjoy the professor 's adventures in the crazy academic world of philology . this is a great book to take with you if you will only have the chance to read in short sips or if you only have time for one more story before bed- just make sure you close the windows so the neighbors do n't complain about the laughter
