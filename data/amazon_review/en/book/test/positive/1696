why is greatness so hard to maintain ? find out here.. this story of a football team illustrates a much more profound element of human psychology - how to handle success . whether success is a relationship , career , business , or any other endeavor , the lessons here are to be heeded or the result will invariably be the same . to put this in context , the 1985 chicago bears football team is arguably the best ever assembled in the modern era . while other teams may have had more success over time , or had 1 less loss , this team is widely regarded as the most dominating . in addition to the on-the-field success , the team created media stars like mike ditka , jim mcmahan and `` the fridge '' , along with established all time greats like walter payton , mike singletary and dan hampton . so what happened ? how did it blow up so fast ? a classic tale of forgetting to continue what made you successful in the first place . the players and the team became successful by playing harder , and using an almost desperate intensity to how they played the game from a play design perspective to personal and individual motivation . at first this focus ( the 46 defense , the frenetic play style ) took the league by surprise and gave them a decided advantage , but like most of us with any kind of success , once it was achieved they forgot to keep changing to adapt to the world they created . in addition , they succumbed to the temptation of starting to believe their own press , and became infatuated with their own greatness . once that happens , it slips away quickly . the detail behind the strategy success and infighting that eroded the spirit of the team , are depicted clearly . after reading this book , which is full of delicious insights and salacious comments amongst the team about each other , it is hard to find where to place the blame . everyone seemed so wrapped up in the media circus that they all seemed to drift away from the mission . for the football fan , this is a great book , full of strategic detail and player reactions . for the person who wants to better understand the dynamics of how to keep themselves or their organization from getting too full of themselves and their success , the lessons here are easy to see , though often difficult to avoid . the book is written exceptionally well , in that it flows easily , is always interesting , follows a nice chronological progressions , and does what it intends - describe the amazing success and quick burn out of perhaps the greatest football team ever assembled .
