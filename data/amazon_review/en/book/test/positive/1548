courtesy of teens read too when eleven-year-old art mumby finds out that a visitor is arriving at his run-down home , larklight , which floats in space beyond the moon , he hardly expects to be thrust into a frightening adventure of pirates , plates , and a millenium-long conflict upon which the fate of the solar system rests . he tells the story of this adventure in larklight ( occasionally giving his older sister , myrtle , a chance to narrate via her diary ) , and the story is nothing if not fantastic . philip reeve ( author of the hungry city chronicles ) has created another fascinating world in larklight . art lives in the victorian society of the 1800 's -- or rather , what victorian society would have looked like if they 'd developed space travel , and astronomy worked according to early speculations about aether ( an air-like substance in space that people can move and breathe in ) , and interplanetary beings ( venus , mars , and the moons of jupiter are all home to a variety of life forms ) . reeve cuts no corners , painting the cities and citizens of the solar system in dazzling detail . the setting is a gorgeous mix of fantasy and science fiction , and fans of both genres will find much to enjoy . if the world was n't exciting enough on its own , the adventure is of the edge-of-your-seat variety . art and myrtle tumble from one tense situation to another with alarming frequency . most chapters end on cliffhangers , so be prepared to have trouble finding a place to pause . reeve throws in enough twists and turns to keep readers guessing right until the end , and both art and myrtle get the chance to play hero . art , as the main character , is not yet a teen himself , so teens may find his narration a little immature for their liking . if they 're willing to give him a chance , though , they will discover that larklight is a fast-paced , imaginative journey well worth taking . reviewed by : lynn cro
