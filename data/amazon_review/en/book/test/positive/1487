an excellent book about my homeland i 've lived in china since 1999 , and i often read stories about china in the western media that i simply do n't believe . others report on abuses that do occur here without giving a reader any understanding of why . so , china remains `` inscrutable . '' ( i'm rolling my eyes ... ) china is a complex subject . how can a westerner who has never been here know what 's happening ? china is so far away and shrouded in a bit of mystery , some due to the sheer length of its history and some due to the power of the party . in my case , i do n't speak chinese , so getting past the public face is impossible . ian johnson of the wall street journal won a pulitzer prize for his reporting on china . he speaks the language . and , he 's one heck of a fine journalist . in wild grass , he recounts the stories of three ordinary chinese citizens who find themselves fighting the repression of the system , risking imprisonment and even death . johnson understands `` the big picture , '' and after reading this book , so will you . a nation is not just a single entity . it's made of people . all nations , not just the one you live in . so what are the people in china like ? read this book , and you'll feel like you 've met some of them . a peasant lawyer , a young architectural student , a bereaved daughter . poor farmers in yulin and party officials in beijing . johnson also brings the scenery to life , makes the unfamiliar familiar , and captures many little details and episodes and ironies . a compelling subject in the hands of a masterful author . china is experiencing unprecented economic development . what effect will this ultimately have on its social and political system ? i do n't agree with all of the author 's conclusions -- it surprises me how much i agree with the party -- but it does n't matter . that 's part of the beauty of this book . to bandy about phrases like `` evil empire '' is the simplistic idiocy that will ( i hope ) eventually doom morons like dubya . can we please move past that and try to genuinely understand ? there can be no doubt that what johnson reports in this book is factually accurate . if you want to learn about china , this is a good place to start . and then , form your own conclusions . there 's plenty of room for you to do that here . which , in the end , is what journalism is all about . i 'm quite glad that i read this book . this is literature , same as george orwell , who i also do n't always agree with . and agreement does not matter . spurring a reader to think is what matters . johnson can do that with the best of them .
