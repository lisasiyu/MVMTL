excellent information i 'm so glad that a friend recommended this book to me . it gave me a better understanding of what 's happening to my baby at various stages in his development , which sets my mind at ease . the book is well-written . it is divided by ages with a general description of how a baby behaves at that particular age and an explanation of what 's happening in the baby 's world and how it affects the baby 's mood in addition to his behavior
