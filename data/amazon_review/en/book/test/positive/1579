another masterpiece another masterpiece from donaldson . pick it up and read it ... . if you like it try out his other books . the story of angus and morn continues , even more gripping and well developed than in the first book . like the real story , there is bleakness and desolation , but they only serve to highlight the characters . the extremes that they are forced to experience shape them and make them believable as individuals , and make this book very dramatic and powerful . you are brought to understand and care about the characters , and by the end you will find yourself looking on to the next book . after reading this book i went out and bought the rest of the series ... . i had no fears about being disappointed by any of the books , and i was n't . two other people in my family were hooked on this series as well , once i showed it to them ( they almost strangled me for losing the third book : )
