pop up ! : a manual of paper mechanisms excellent book ! i have a nice collection of pop up books as well as books about their construction . this book is outstanding . the drawings are clear in their explanations and descriptions -- much more so than photographs would be . you can see the fronts , backs , sides , edges -- whatever is pertinent to understanding the form being illustrated . one especially nice feature is the author 's explanation of things to watch out for -- potential stumbling blocks to creating a functioning mechanism . he begins with the basics and then demonstrates elaborations . i think his illustrating applications of the forms is inspiring and informative -- he goes beyond showing how to make , for example , a pop-up box and uses examples that show what a pop-up box might be . i consider this book a `` must have '' for those interested in the subject
