scrumptous i absolutely love paula and this is the first cookbook of hers that i 've bought . the book has a great layout ( cakes , pies , cookies , bars , etc . ) there are a few pictures ( they are not on the same pages as their recipes ) that make me want to bake even more ! everything in the book sounds so delicious but the thing that really got me was her pound cake . now she has about 5 or 6 pound cake variations - i tried the cream cheese variation . over the past 6 months i have been searching for `` the '' pound cake recipe and have tried a ton of different ones always with disappointment . when i tried paula 's i kept my expectations low and i was blown away ! ! it actually tasted like pound cake , not too sweet , not to floury -- just perfect ! ! ! i ca n't wait to try the rest of her recipes , for each ten i looked at i would deffinitely try at least 8 and consider the other 2 ! a minor disappointment is that some of her recipes call for pre-made cake mixes . although it is great for cutting down on time i suppose , i do n't see the sense in putting pre-made mixes into a cookbook . still does n't take away from the flavor or temptation of her desserts . excellence
