review for those who have n't read mitchell i originially bought this book because i am a fan of mcsorley 's and wanted to learn a little about new york history . i had no previous knowledge of joseph mitchell 's works , and did not know what to expect . i wondered how someone could write a 350 page book about when bar . then i soon realized that the book is a compilation of short stories about the characters of the city in the 30 's and 40 's . primary source history usually bores me , because it is often dry , about someone consequential , and you have to read through alot for a little interesting information . but the way mitchell presents these characters you are drawn in into their plight , eccentricities , or just regular routines . i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the city , or if you are a fan of the bar and are just curious like mysel
