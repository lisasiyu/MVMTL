crossword puzzling for fun and profit matt gaffney is one of only a dozen or so people in the u.s. who makes a living as a freelance crossword puzzle constructor . it 's not easy and there 's a lot of competition . the pay per puzzle is low and it takes hours to construct a quality puzzle . how does he do it ? the same way any freelancer does it . he works his butt off . after creating some of the best puzzles around , he finds new markets , cultivates old markets , networks , looks for new angles , and acts as his own bill collector . his latest angle is gridlock , an entertaining book about the crossword puzzle business and the eccentric people who populate it . gridlock is a somewhat unstructured , but fun look at the crossword world from the viewpoint of a constructor . previous crossword books have profiled constructors ( the crossword obsession ) , told how to construct crosswords ( the puzzlemaker 's handbook ) , or told of life as a crossword solver ( crossworld ) . as far as i know , this is the first look from the constructor 's point of view . gaffney takes us behind the scenes at the annual crossword puzzle tournament . he tells us how he came to be a crossword constructor , how he nearly had to give up freelancing and get a real job , and what saved him from that awful fate . he describes what goes into the construction of a puzzle ( it 's more interesting than you might imagine ) , and tackles the computer vs. human constructor debate . he finishes up with a profile of puzzlemaker and noted recluse henry hook . with that final chapter , it 's apparent that if gaffney ever runs out of work as a crossword constructor ( is sudoku a passing fad or something more sinister ? ) , he 'll be able to make a career as a more traditional freelance writer
