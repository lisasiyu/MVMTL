great resource - do n't confuse it though this book is a great resource for all aspiring competitive runners . however , do n't confuse this book with glover 's other book - which is more for beginning and non-competitive runners . there is a lot of overlap between the two books , so there is not much point in buying both . however , i can see a beginner outgrowing the beginner book and wanting the extra info that the `` competitive '' handbook can provide . both are great .
