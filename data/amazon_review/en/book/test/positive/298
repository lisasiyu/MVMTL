one of better of the chris hart books ... i have come to the conclusion that the more cartoony/funny pages books by chris hart are best written , clearly explained and better informed . this book is great to get a good feel for the 60 's retro hanna barbera/ pink panther cool mccool [ giving away my age ! ! ! ] style of cartoons . the part about creating your on style and constructing heads/ bodies is good . the part on showing emotion is well thought out . as mentioned before ; the other books that deal w/ manga/mechas , etc are not that clear in terms of expalaining content/ process ; but the more humerous books are .
