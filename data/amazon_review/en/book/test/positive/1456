one of a beautiful series this book has absolutely beautiful paintings that compliment the familiar song over the rainbow . my 5 year old daughter likes it a lot . her absolute favorite in the series is i live in music by ntozake shange , which is part of this series , and might seem odd for a pre-schooler , but her whole class really responded to it as well
