from book to memories i remember reading this book as a child and loving it . now 21 and in my 3rd year of college , i come back to the memeories of this book and the stories . still vivid in my mind is the picture of little bear going outside in the cold weather only to return home asking his mother for something warm to wear and in the end relazing he had his own fur coat all along , and then him taking off to the moom . i 'm studying to become a teacher and making a book list for one of my classes and this is sure to be on there
