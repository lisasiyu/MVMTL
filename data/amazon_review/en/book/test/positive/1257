the way history should be written alistair horne 's epic about verdun is one of the best history books i have ever read . he provides detailed information with the style which makes all the facts flow . not only does he detail the battle itself , but takes time out to describe the adventures of a german sergeant kunze who infiltrates forts douaumont . what makes this chapter different is the almost minute by minute retelling of the soldier 's activities . he actually stops to eat in a fort surrounded by the enemy with prisoners he captured locked in a broom closet ! i have previously read how far from austerlitz ? by horne and enjoyed it as much as verdun . this book is the second in a three part trilogy covering the franco-prussian war ( the fall of paris ) and world war ii ( to lose a battle france 1940 ) all definitely worth the time to read .
