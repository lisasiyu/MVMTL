very useful reference . this is one of those books that every beginner needs . it starts with the simplest characters with the least amount of strokes and builds on those simple characters to more complex ones . i like the book . i 'm an abc and i find it a useful reference as i am beginning to learn and add more characters to my database . in reference to the other review which is warning people to steer clear of this book ; traditional chinese is very useful to know . it is after all the original language that is closest to medieval chinese and is the writing which all simplified chinese writing is based . although , hong kong and taiwan will be switching over to the simplified forms of writing in the next few years , i do n't believe that means traditional characters will disappear .
