your coffee table needs this book . jean-marie potiez has produced a wonderful book . the fantastic photos ( many of which have not previously been published ) are worth the price of the book alone . the photos must have been very carefully selected : they are all , unfailingly , flattering and the band never look less than achingly glamorous . the informative and enjoyable commentary , pieced together from a mind-boggling number of interviews , is clearly a labour of love and there are many surprisingly revealing and poignant quotes . particularly sweet ( and , ultimately , sad , given the couple 's subsequent history ) is frida 's statement that the best thing that ever happened to her was benny , not abba . the history of the ultimate pop group is traced on a year-by-year basis , from the mid 1960s , following the pre-abba careers of each member , through the romantic encounters , to the eurovision win , to the will-we-ever-have-another-hit ? tension , to ( phew ! ) world domination . every step is lavishly illustrated with great photos . abba 's story reads like a film script - humble beginnings , beautiful people in love , amazing talent , runaway success leading to a heartbreaking denoument . there is even a 'where are they now ? ' epilogue . this book wipes the floor with potiez 's video documentary of the band ( & quot ; thank you abba & quot ; ) . while it will certainly be a treasured luxury for abba 's huge army of fans , this excellent book will also be of interest to anybody with an interest in perfect pop
