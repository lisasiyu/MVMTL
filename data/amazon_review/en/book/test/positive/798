stunned ( in a good way ) first , let me say that i am a very independent , very headstrong , liberal wife who has a higher education than her husband ( masters ' degree ) , owns a business and takes no b.s . from anyone . when this book came out , i truly thought it was a joke . who would write a book like this outside of the 1950s ? ! and where is the `` proper care ... of wives '' ? ! to add 'insult ' , a coworker of my husband ( whose wife stays at home with their 4 kids because they feel that this is the role wives are supposed to take on ) , is the one who offered to lend it to me . i thought , `` this will be interesting '' but ca n't criticize until giving it a shot , right ? ? ? ok - there 's the background - here 's the review : i could n't put the book down and read it in a just over a day . while i do n't agree 100 % with all that dr. laura says , and as another reviewer commented that there are parts that men may find insulting , this book has changed my life , and as a result it has changed my husband 's life - both for the better . after 7 years of marriage , we are clicking like we never have before . i ca n't explain it to you , or to my married best friends whose jaws dropped as i confessed to them over margaritas that i not only read the book but i loved the book . all i can say is that the foundation makes sense . it does n't bash working women - dr. laura is one , after all . but it does point out , not so discreetly , that your family - the family you have chosen to create - should come above all else . and that the extremism of some aspects of the feminist movement is self-destructive to women , men and society as a whole . and as i turned each page and as i tried to rebel against some parts ( i should n't burden him with the tales of my day ? ? ! ) , peel away the layers , let down your defenses and let it make sense . ( it is n't that my day is less significant , but men and women communicate differently - vent to him about your day and he 'll feel like a second class citizen and a failure for not being able to fix your stress . vent to your girlfriends and they 'll dish with you ! focus your time on your husband , family , relationship , etc. , once you get home instead . ) and let me tell ya once you leave the work day at the door , your home becomes your home again , too . so it 's win-win ! really ! ! ! dr. laura 's book includes parts and pieces of past calls and letters , which is a helpful , practical demonstration of her points and breaks things up so you do n't feel like you 're getting a lecture ( especially if you are ready to admit you 've been doing a few thngs wrong ! ) . and as you can see the lightbulb go on with average janes all over the country and across time in the dialogue- from them pushing back on her advice to ( aha ! ) getting her message during their conversations , you see the pettiness we can cling to and frankly , the underlying simplicity in each of her messages . ok - still skeptical ? then rent it at the library for free and give it a shot . just try to put her ideas into practice - commit to changing for a week ( if you are n't sold on changing your life ) ... what 's the worst that can happen ? if it 's all wrong for you , you have just lost a quick week and you can pat yourself on the back for being right and you can write your own book . ; - ) but just think - what if it works ? ! then you will find a new meaning in your life that you did n't know you were missing . you will have a much happier and rewarding marriage . your husband will adore you . ( sounds rough , huh ? ) trust me - i 'm not about to become a submissive , mindless person rather than an equal partner in a relationship . but as i made a few minor tweaks in how i treat the man i chose to marry and spend the rest of my life with , i have received rewards from him 10-fold . and to think i thought i was doing it 'right ' all along . ; 0 )
