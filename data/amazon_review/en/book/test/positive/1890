an excellent introduction to henry james and his style & quot ; the aspern papers & quot ; is a surprisingly short , sexy and suspenseful novel . it will completely change your opinion of henry james ; he shows himself to be an master of suspense and well played out drama instead of the ambiguous pussyfooting plodder that most people think him to be . there is a definite touch of evil in this novella . it takes place in a stuffy interior world dominated by an old sinister woman in a green shade . the narrator 's intentions are quite amoral and evil . the narration is deftly created through sure touches of insecurity and self pity . the trick of the unreliable narrator is used to great effect . and at no point does it seem anything other than a seamless and effective method of narration
