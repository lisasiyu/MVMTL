very detailed book . this book contains very good drawings of various craftsman details . everything from front doors to various builtins . the author shows the historic details and how to recreate them with modern construction methods and materials . there are no color photos , but none are need for the type of book it is . i would love to have this author release a book on craftsman exteriors ! ! !
