do n't delay ! order `` apocalypse delayed '' today ! i 've read this book several times , and i would place it second only to jehovah unmasked in its impact on the watchtower sect . i am a former jehovah 's witness who attended the international convention of jehovah 's witnesses in chicago in 1969 . i was there when then-president of the watchtower society , nathan homer knorr , announced to the audience that `` 1975 marks the end of six thousand years of man 's existence , and begins the seventh millennium since adam 's creation . this seventh millennium will run concurrently with the one thousand year earthly reign of jesus christ . therefore the great tribulation and the battle of armageddon must occur sometime before 1975 ! '' this prediction can also be found in old watchtower books no longer published by the society , such as the `` freedom of the sons of god '' book . the jehovah 's witnesses of today are either unaware of this 1975 prediction , or they swallow the watchtower lies about it . when i was a witness i was taught to `` lie for the truth . '' this practice was called theocratic warfare . the idea is that it 's commendable to lie in the furtherance of `` the truth . '' this oxymoronic hypocrisy goes right over the heads of jehovah 's witnesses . anyway , that 's why jw reviewers of this book lie and say the watchtower high command never made a prediction about 1975 . the watchtower society has even managed to get some of the witnesses to believe that it was the lowly witnesses themselves , the rank and file , that made this false prophecy , not the brooklyn oracles ( watchtower high command ) . talk about mind control ! so , crisis of conscience is a marvelous nail in the coffin of the watchtower cult and it 's mounting pile of dead children whose parents denied them life-saving blood transfusions . as well as the growing scandal of pedophilia as more and more watchtower `` elders '' are exposed as pedophiles . the watchtower high command shields these sexual predators from prosecution , and instead disfellowships the victims of watchtower sexual abuse ! jehovah 's witnesses promote ignorance , superstition , medical quackery , and encourage pedophilia by covering it up and punishing the victims ! the watchtower high command controls every aspect of a witnesses thinking , telling them they can not vote , can not join a political party , can not join a union , can not join a lodge , can not serve in public office , can not serve on a jury , can not join the armed forces , can not salute the flag , can not celebrate holidays , can not celebrate birthdays , can not step inside a church even to attend a wedding or funeral of a non-witness loved one . they forbid jw 's from reading any religious material other than their own , and even forbid married couples from engaging in oral or anal copulation . they work hard to keep women `` in their place '' and even strongly admonish their youth against going to college , preferring to keep jw 's ignorant , credulous , and malleable to their will . all of these prohibitions ( and hundreds more ) carry the punishment of shunning , complete ostracism , from the group . this winds up destroying the lives of witnesses , and tears whole families apart , when they can no longer speak to their loved ones , nor their loved ones speak to them . the watchtower high command ( the 'governing body of jehovah 's witnesses ' ) knows nothing of the grace and love and mercy of god , but are the most harsh , merciless , pharisaic , legalistic , mean-spirited , judgemental group of bitter old men with delusions of grandeur ever to walk the earth ! i was trapped in the watchtower religion for four long years . i know whereof i speak . it is an un-american religion that exercises far greater mind-control and life-control over its members than even the pope does over roman catholics . yet the witnesses condemn the pope for dictating dogma to his people . the witnesses are unable to see this double-standard , the hypocrisy . they 're blind , as all religious zealots ultimately are . so , by all means purchase crisis of conscience as well as jehovah unmasked ! for a one-two combination to the face and head of the watchtower high command . you should `` pity the fool '' who becomes ensnared in the watchtower cult or has been raised in it , for they are a slave to the watchtower and exist to do its bidding . thankfully , the jw growth rate has slowed to a crawl and young people raised as jw 's are abandoning ship in record numbers ! : ) would you like me to go into more detail as to why crisis of conscience was penned ? i will assume the answer is `` yes '' and will extrapolate . `` demons '' inhabit the literature of non-jw christians according to the watchtower high command , so witnesses must be careful not to touch it and never read it . `` you never know when a demon might be lurking inside a gospel tract , just waiting to invade your body and mind ! '' so witnesses are told never to read or even touch any books or literature from other religions . in reality , this is a transparent ploy to make sure the witnesses are ever exposed to what non-witnesses have to say about the failed prophecies , doctrinal flip-flops , and theological somersaults regularly engaged in by the governing body of jehovah 's witnesses . the watchtower society holds it 's slaves in the steely grip of the primitive fear of demons . the watchtower society strongly discourages it 's slaves from owning a personal computer or surfing the internet . their ostensible explanation is again `` demons . '' the demons will infect your sin-infested mind if you dare to read anything on the net that displays the failed prophecies , doctrinal gyrations and theological flip-flops of the governing body . this is also why jehovah 's witnesses are strongly discouraged from reading old books the governing body no longer publish . they do n't wish their slaves to know how much their doctrines keeping mutating and evolving into one monster after another . the watchtower society claims it speaks for almighty god himself , and you 'd better believe what they say unquestioningly , and obey them explicitly , or you are doomed to be destroyed in the battle of armageddon . therefore , jesus christ is n't the savior of the rank-and-file jehovah 's witnesses , the governing body is ! the governing body officially and openly teach the `` earthly class '' ( the rank-and-file jehovah 's witnesses ) that jesus christ did not die for them , but only for the anointed class of 144,000 who will go to heaven . also , even though the watchtower high command claims to speak for god , and insist that rejecting their words will insure your doom at god 's hands , they claim they are n't divinely inspired ! the watchtower high command tells jehovah 's witnesses , in the pages of the watchtower magazine , that they speak for god almighty himself . then on the next page they declare the exact opposite , and claim they are just poor imperfect folks stumbling along just like the rank and file witnesses , and are not inspired . right after claiming to be god 's earthly representatives , speaking for god almighty ! ! so , the brooklyn oracles have it both ways . they demand unquestioning and total obedience as god 's earthly representatives , but plead `` imperfection '' and say `` but we never said we 're divinely inspired '' when caught in a failed prophecy or doctrinal flip-flop . which happens a lot throughout their history . old discarded doctrines and failed prophecies are called `old light ' and today 's doctrines and prophetic speculations are called `` new light . '' the problem is that `` new light ' quickly becomes `` old light '' and often even `` old light '' becomes `` new light '' again ! people who have been shunned ( and therefore become as one dead to their families and friends ) because they did n't submit to some ever-changing watchtower flapdoodle , are never apologized to or allowed back into the group when the doctrine is rejected for something new . the watchtower high command are callous old fools with delusions of grandeur , squirted full to bursting with hubris . going door-to-door and obeying every whim of the watchtower society is how the earthly class of jehovah 's witnesses prove their faithfulness to jehovah and thereby earn salvation . they are taught they are not saved by jesus christ . they are taught that if they have any chance at all at salvation , it will come by belonging to the watchtower society and believing it unquestioningly and obeying it explicitly . so , do n't admire witnesses for their zeal . they 're just trying to earn brownie points with god by fearing and obeying what they mistakenly believe to be god 's mouthpiece . in reality they do n't really care about you . they only care about saving their own hides . the governing body of jehovah 's witnesses have passed thousands of `` theocratic laws '' about everything one could imagine . from banning blood transfusions , oral and anal sex even between married heterosexuals , to prohibiting such things as celebrating holidays or birthdays , voting , holding public office , serving on a jury , saluting the flag , or going to college ! to list the thousands of laws they have enacted against their slaves would take hundreds of pages . if you think the orthodox and chassidic jews have a lot of religious laws , you 'll change your mind if you study watchtower literature . even when i was a witness , i knew that some of the watchtower pronouncements were quackery both medically and theologically . such as the blood transfusion ban . i 'd never been able to take seriously their belief that `` the soul is in the blood '' but went along with it rather than be ostracized . to jehovah 's witnesses it is literally a matter of life and death . a lot of witnesses ( including children ) die because they refuse blood transfusions . in the past , the watchtower high command has enforced other types of medical quackery upon the poor victimized jehovah 's witnesses , including ridiculous `` cures '' for cancer that resulted in the deaths of many witnesses . do n't just take my word for all this , buy and read crisis of conscience and jehovah unmasked ! both are fascinating reads .
