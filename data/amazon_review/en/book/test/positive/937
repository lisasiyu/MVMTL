a book to cherish how can one write a review of the story of san michele that comes close to doing justice to the book ? there are many humorous episodes , such as the giant and mamsell agata , touches of the macabre in the description of the cholera epidemic in naples , misadventures , like the journey to sweden accompanying a young man ( then his corpse ) . there are also angry moments , as when his dog tom is brutally kicked by the slimy vicomte maurice . who could not be moved by the story of the boy john , who was rescued by munthe but never lived long enough to find a loving home . it is a book that includes many memorable events in a life that was very full indeed . many of the chapters in this book could be made into marvelous films , given the right adaptation . the story of san michele is very well written , to say the least , and the many people , events and personal feelings of the author combine to make this a special adventure . perhaps most special of all is axel munthe 's relationship to animals that allowed him to get close , even to `` wild '' animals and have a special relationship with them . he was a man who held nature and all life in special regard but was pragmatic in the face of illness and death . i have had a copy since 1988 and i have given axel munthe 's book as a gift and been thanked for the introduction . i could not recommend this book highly enough .
