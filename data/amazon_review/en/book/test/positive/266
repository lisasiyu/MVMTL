huzun redux . i returned from my 6th visit to istanbul a couple of days ago . i took along pamuk 's book thinking it might be fun to read about the city during my stay ... this is not really a fun book to read , though it is a good one . as one reviewer pointed out the translation is very well done . the style is smooth and flowing . if you ca n't visit istanbul in the grips of winter , pamuk 's book will give you some idea of what it is to walk alone through this great cities back streets and alleyways and to feel history rising up to meet you at every turn . there really is a special melancholia to istanbul in the winter and pamuk captures it perfectly .
