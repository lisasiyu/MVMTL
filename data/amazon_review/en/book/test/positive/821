sophisticated alternatives , indeed ! finally , a reference book that offers its users more sophisticated word choices in a format that makes such inherent sense ! peter meltzer 's book stands out in the way that he differentiates his thesaurus from other , heretofore , conventional ones . the rogets of the world , as meltzer states , `` start out with the premise that the user already knows the synonyms , '' and their guidebooks merely help to `` jog his or her memory . '' meltzer 's book provides its users with new , sophisticated synonyms which , importantly , are neither archaic nor obsolete . in fact , nearly every synonym is followed by an example of its usage that is taken from actual articles or books , which is fascinating . additionally , meltzer offers what he calls `` clarifiers '' to 75 % of his entries . these clarifiers amplify the single word you may be seeking . for example , there are seven uses for `` unusual , '' each with its own specific synonym that more aptly describes `` unusual '' , as in unusual/unconventional , unusual/supernatural , unusual/person , etc . do n't expect to find the simple synonyms that you 're used to seeing in other thesauri . meltzer gives you the benefit of the doubt that you already know those words and offers you a more exciting , more intelligent way to shape your vocabulary . regardless of your writing needs , this book is a must-have . i enjoyed reading the introduction , it gave me a strong sense of the book 's layout and reminded me why a thesaurus is not just for writing college term papers
