one of the best ! first of all , i 'm not jeannine ; i 'm her husband-she bought the book for me . i have been wanting to build a guitar ( and bass ) for a very long time , and have been gathering information from a variety of sources . but this book covers it all as far as construction goes , and its not too bad on the finishing side of things . it covers 3 different types of neck construction , and flat top and carved top bodys . definately money well spent
