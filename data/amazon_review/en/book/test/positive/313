sets the standard for hard sci-fi astronomers detect a large object entering the solar system from deep space . at first it is thought to be just another large rock , but scientists soon discover that it is actually a colossal space ship called rama . a team of scientists blast off from earth to investigate in a ship called the endeavor . what follows is a story of exploration , and one of the best conceived hard sci-fi tales ever written . who built rama ? what is it 's purpose ? why did it come to our solar system ? the story follows the progress of the astronauts/scientists in the not too distant future as they methodically explore the unknown space ship . each new discovery brings new surprises as well . this is also a political tale as well as factions on the ship and on earth have very different ideas about what rama is , what is represents , and what should be done . this book is , in my opinion , one of the most intelligent and well thought-out hard sci-fi novels ever written . first published in 1973 , it remains as fresh as if it were written today . there are several things that i really like about this novel . first , the exploration of rama by the crew of the endeavor proceeds in an organized and intelligent manner by men and women who are not superhuman . discoveries are assimilated , risks are weighed , and the plan evolves . one common problem with this sub-genre of sci-fi ( particularly when transfered to tv ) is that individuals of superhuman stature ( e.g . the main character has a ph.d. in astrophysics , was in the special forces , a fighter pilot , and in their spare time a classically trained french chef , a lyric poet , and fluent in ten languages ) go off on their own to make brilliant discoveries while narrowly avoiding death . this may add drama to the plot , but this cheapens the story and moves the entire story from believable to fantastic . the characters , while perhaps representing some of the best and brightest of humanity , are not absurdly talented beyond reason . second , rama itself is fascinating . clarke constructed a rich world for his intrepid adventures to explore . finally , there is a sense of wonder or awe associated with the exploration of rama that many have tried to duplicate , but none have even come remotely close to succeeding . this book has `atmosphere ' . early in the novel clarke analogizes the exploration of rama with the opening of tutankhamen 's tomb . there is something wonderful and mysterious about rama that goes far beyond current human understanding , but understandable by humans nonetheless by scientific analysis and reflection . it is this last aspect that really makes this novel better than 2001 . in the latter novel , the aliens are so advanced that they are utterly incomprehensible . in rama , the alien technology can be understood by homo sapiens . if i had any complaint at all , the novel is a bit short by modern standards . it really seems light at about 240 pages , and it would have been nice if clarke had further developed several of the story lines . in any case , this is a book that can be read over and over again . there are very few books that i read a second time , but this has been one of them . in the end , there are more questions than answers , and many of the questions are not resolved . i have not read any of the sequels because i heard they are really bad and i do n't want to spoil this novel . this is one of the novels that put clarke into the great three of sci-fi ( with heinlein and asimov ) , and it won both the hugo and the nebula award . this novel really defines and/or sets the standard for the sci-fi sub-genre of exploration/interstellar archaeology
