what a great teaching tool - nice biographical vignettes i am one of those who loves booknotes and book-tv and feels a real loss when my schedule keeps me away from them ( yes , i can pick them up on the c-span websites , but it just is n't quite the same ) . these books are just one of the additional reasons some of us refer to brian lamb as saint brian . the chapters are digests of the information gleaned during the actual booknotes broadcasts . each one is from an individual author and in this case , it is on the lives of famous americans . there are something like 80 to 85 of these biographical vignettes . some of them are autobiographical when the author being interviewed about their book was also a notable american in their own right . we all know mr. lamb 's unique style of quantum interviewing ( one can never predict the precise location of his next question ) . these edited and assembled pieces have a somewhat more organized and focused feel , but there is still a bit of the cooks tour approach to each subject . having watched many of the shows from which these articles were made and also having read several of the books by these authors , i can still say that even when the material here is familiar it is still fun to dash through because it is so concisely presented and decently edited . when the material is unfamiliar it is very delightful and an invitation to more study and investigation . i am not only happy to have this dandy book , i am actually grateful for it . it is a marvelous tool for introducing children to biographical subjects ! the book also has an index and a list of all the booknotes programs through the publishing date of the book
