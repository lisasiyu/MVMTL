challenging , but worth it ! the road to serfdom is a book that you see recommended on many reading lists , and for good reason . hayek shows the reader , from many different directions , why socialism is doomed to failure . he carefully explains why socialism in its pure form leads , inevitably , to totalitarianism . hayek 's illustrations and explanations are quite clear . i found myself somewhat challenged by hayek 's writing style . make no mistake , this can be a somewhat difficult book to read . keep in mind though , that it is a book that should be read a little at a time and pondered upon . the first chapter seemed to be the most difficult . if you can make it through the first chapter , then you are home free . in the end , i was fascinated by this book . hayek 's ability to see in 1944 what became apparent only many years later to most of his contemporaries , is remarkable . even though this is no easy read , its more than worth the effort .
