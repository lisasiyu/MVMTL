a look behind the curtain ! i miss old fashioned letters , now that we live in the age of email . frotunately , i still have 'real ' letters saved that have now collected dust from my parent 's generation , and from a time gone by . occasionally i stumble over published letters of famous writers in antique bookstores : last time , it was a 800 page volume of some of ernest hemingway 's personal letters ; the first edition of this amazon edition . they were published posthumeously , and not intended by eh for publication . we get a peek behind the curtain , and learn among other things that ernest hemingway was addicted to letters , wrote lots and lots , starting in his teens ; and that he was really depressed when he did n't receive replies ; or when there were days when the postman brought no letters . waiting for transatlantic mail added to his sense of loneliness . letters were a lifelong passion of his , continuing up to the day when he took his own life . these private letters were n't meant to be published , and they are raw , but very honest . when you read them , you are in no doubt that the writer is a true artist , and an original ! they stretch over the span of his productive life , and they are varied : addressed to family ( his parents , his children ) , his ex , to friends , including famous contemporaries , such as marlene dietrich ( just one of them ) , his agent ( s ) , his publishers , and many more . i have a hunch eh must have been hard to keep up with , but his letters are fun to read ; even though , in my view , his novels are mixed : some great , and some i do n't care for . guess , eh 's life was bizare too . the private letters are consistent with that . and yet , they exude a special warmth ; both gentelness and passion . reviewed by palle jorgensen . december 2004 .
