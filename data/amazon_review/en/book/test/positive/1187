khruschev - a most amazing mixture of mercuriality and idiosyncrasy brought vividly to life if - and that is a big if ( the book is fully 600 pages long - it helps to fall ill when you read it - i did ! ) - you have the time and want to invest it for obtaining a first class overview over the great power play during the decade between 1955 and 1965 - the khruschev era - this definitely is the book to read ! its authors not only provide a refreshingly new perspective to the ( more or less well- ) known events of , i.a. , the first israeli-egyptian war , the ( soviet ) occupation of hungary and the cuban missile crisis , they fully succeed in transforming this period of history into a most plausible and very exciting `` story '' , in fact , into something of a `` thriller '' ( in the best sense of the word ) . it is the story of a great power desperate to come up to its claim to possess or at least to be accorded equal status with the other - even greater - super-power , the united states or , more generally , the `` west '' . in order to achieve that one goal , almost anything would do , even extreme brinkmanship that several times brought the world close to thermonuclear war . khrushev is shown as a man to have carried within himself the dominating characteristics of the soviet union itself , viz. , an enormous inferiority complex , trying to combine it with catching any opportunity that would present itself to bring pressure to bear on the other side , even using or better : threatening the use of force , wherever it seemed this might bring political advantage . fortunately for the world , this mercurial leader who disposed of the means to blow up the world ( or at least : great parts of it ) was restrained enough ( be it on his own reason , be it by his more risk-averse colleagues within the presidium ) not to actually let the world go `` over the brink '' but to withdraw each time at the last moment . it is the humiliation of these retreats as well as the sense of responsibility displayed by him in making them which , if anything , ultimately cost him his job and earns him the status of a statesman ( rather than merely that of a cunning politician ) . against this background , only two - very minor - criticisms : first , there is a really unwarranted `` blank space '' in the book as regards the european economic community ( today`s `` european union '' ) whose very creation was decisively triggered by some of the events described in it ( suez ; hungary ) , by making the european states mercilessly feel their own palsy vis-Ã -vis the super-powers . it is ironic - and should clearly have been mentioned in the book - to see how the very institution for whose creation khruschev bore no minor responsibility - would become one of the cornerstones of the west 's economic superiority and thus a decisive factor for the eventual downfall of the soviet empire . second , even though this would admittedly go slightly beyond the clear scope of the book ( khruschev 's cold war , restricting its topic to his role as politician ) , it might have been interesting for the reader to be permitted at least a brief peep behind the veil of this astounding politician 's official role into his private life , if only to underpin/corroborate some of the conclusions regarding this most mercurial character ! this leaves only one thing to be hoped for : at least i , for my part , am dying to read part ii : `` the breshnev years '' , by the same authors , should it ever come out !
