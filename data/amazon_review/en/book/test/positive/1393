inequal relationships in the tenant of wildfell hall , anne bronte proves herself to be just as capable a writer as her more famous sisters . this novel is about the suffering of one woman living in an unhappy marriage , and bronte uses that story to display the desperation of women of that time trapped in inequal relationships . she also manages to show the strength and cleverness with which women managed to make use of what little power they had . the characters are well-developed and come alive in every scene , and the dialogue of the novel is very powerful . at the end , however , the story peters out ; though the framing of the novel through a series of letters works well for most of the book , the last few chapters are weak , as bronte tries too hard to create a firm end for every minor character she introduced throughout the book , and it does n't quite fit with the narrative . but besides those few pages , this book is solidly written and clearly conceived . i strongly recommend it for anyone desiring a somewhat more realistic view of the period than presented by either of her sister 's novels , but with just as great of writing
