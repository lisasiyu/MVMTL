perspective reporting that are way better than the well worn war stories mr. minter comes through again with a hard hitting reporting style that comes up with stories that are n't reported adequately elsewhere in the media . taking investigative journalism to places that other pontificators only dream about richard minter tells more stories about the war on terror that americans need to read . in a style somewhere between tom clancy and bill gertz , minter delivers style and prose that is easy on the brain , flowing and captivating . i was glued to the pages . it was an enjoyable read that provided a great perspective into many under-reported aspects of the war . his bias leaks through as a conservative and hawkish but the prose does n't come across as an ideologue . he backs his information up with interviews and facts and provides supportive information that i found to be entirely persuasive . the material is well researched and he presents an exceptional bibliography for further reading . this is a book that everyone should read , conservatives and democrats alike . minter finds pieces and interviews that no one else has and this niche makes for great exploration of the subject materials at hand .
