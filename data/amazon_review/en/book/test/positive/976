best whole grain bread book around i have never taken the time to write a review on a book that i have purchased from amazon . thanks to all of you who do . this time was the exception . this book is incredible ! every recipe can be tailored to your stlye of breadmaking . it has directions for a bread machine , mixer , or the old fashioned way . i have tried a half dozen of the recipes so far and they are all delicious . my compliments to the author . the money has been well spent . thanks
