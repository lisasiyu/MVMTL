the edgar alan poe of shakespeare 's day . for those of you who saw `` shakespeare in love , '' you will probably remember john webster as the 13 year old boy who was obsessed with blood and death . john webster 's plays came out about the time william shakespeare was putting out his final plays . hazelton spencer says this of john webster : `` even webster 's most lyrical verse is preoccupied with decay and death . '' but if we are willing to move past this , john webster 's writing is actually quite impressive . act 1 begins with the banishment of count lodovico . interestingly , lodovico tells of the evil bracciano . ( why not ? it would seem people of an evil nature would know each other . ) and through the testimony of his judges , we are introduced to the evil behind lodovico . we later meet the diabolical bracciano himself . he is having an affair with his friend flamineo 's sister vittoria . not surprisingly , vittoria has a nightmare about a massacre . we later see that cornelia ( the mother of vittoria and flamineo ) does not care for them . in act 2 , we meet the cardinal . we are allowed to respect him in that he is no flatterer . webster then shows us the division between the diabolical bracciano and the at least moderately virtuous francisco . ( francisco is of course angered that his sister isabella is being mistreated by her husband bracciano . ) but bracciano 's untainted son giovanni breaks the tension with some comic relief . with the use of magical images , bracciano sees his murder plot against his wife isabella and vittoria 's husband camillo come to pass . but lodovico sees the death of isabella , and he will return before long . onto act 3 . the cardinal suspects that vittoria had something to do with her husband 's death . we know that it was not vittoria 's fault , but how sorry can we feel for her ? if she was this intimate with the diabolical bracciano , how ignorant could she have been ( unless she was very obtuse ) to the evil she submitted herself to ? the cardinal sentences vittoria to life as a nun . during the trial , flamineo is frightened that his part in aiding the affair will come out . and lodovico makes his return . he loved isabella ( even though she would not submit to having an affair with him ) , and lodovico will avenge her . ( perhaps webster was trying to use contrast between isabella and vittoria to limit our sympathy to vittoria . ) onto act 4 . the cardinal informs francisco of his sister 's murder . francisco of course wants revenge . while we have no real reason to dislike the cardinal or see him as a bad person , it is interesting that the cardinal has a book of criminals . can we doubt for a moment that lodovico is listed in it ? ( but like shakespeare and dickens , webster is really skilled at creating fully 3d characters as opposed to hollywood heroes and villains . ) isabella 's ghost appears to francisco . ( probably to make sure francisco will not hesitate in his revenge . ) bracciano and vittoria meet again , and while vittoria is reluctant , she and bracciano marry . act 4 ends with the cardinal becoming pope . after rebuking lodovico , the cardinal approves of him joining in fracisco 's revenge . perhaps here , webster is pointing out a 'terrible truth ' that hollywood ca n't figure out . as people , we are not 100 % good or evil . and while the cardinal is a virtuous person , he agrees to the revenge on bracciano even to the point of employing the evil lodovico . and while we know lodovico is evil , we probably will applaud him if he contributes to bracciano 's comeuppance . onto act 5 . bracciano and vittoria marry . disuised , francisco finds his way into bracciano 's territory . well , fracisco and lodovico succeed in killing bracciano . but things are not quite over . giovanni is sad over his father 's death . vittoria ( bracciano 's widow ) is in charge for the moment . and flamineo thinks he can get some money out of his sister . ( why not ? he aided her in her affair . vittoria probably has access to money now . ) bracciano 's ghost appears to flamineo foreshadowing his downfall . interestingly , in john webster , ghosts appear to the people who were close to them as opposed to their enemies . the play ends in the massacre of zanche , flamineo , and vittoria by lodovico . ( undoubtedly , francisco and lodovico wanted them dead as well to avenge isabella . ) giovanni to some extent restores orders and lodovico tells giovanni that francisco was involved . lodovico can be punished , but what can giovanni do to his uncle francisco ? francisco is also a duke . overall , its a good play , but you do have to have a tolerance for brutal scenes as well as passages preoccupied with death .
