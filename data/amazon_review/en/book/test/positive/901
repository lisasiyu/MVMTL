unraveling a tangled skein of deception long-time fans of the series will enjoy many elements of this book : sharon and hy finally marry ; sharon 's birth mother and adopted mother meet one another ; sharon 's agency expands with some new operatives ; and rae finds herself back doing some detection . in addition , there 's a dark , detailed plot that builds from a very old , cold case . one of the strengths of this story comes in ms. muller 's deft handling of so many past characters and weaving them the on-going story line . it adds a rich texture to the book that builds depth . that texture is nicely developed also by ms. muller 's strong ability to build a sense of place as almost another character in the story . the cold case is quite complex and requires an extensive investigation using many resources . but it 's not a classic mystery in that you 'll be able to put three clues together in the beginning and figure out who did what to whom . instead , you 'll be able to figure out the next plot development in the procedural about 5-15 pages ahead of time . the book 's main drawback comes in its unappealing characters . most readers like either sympathetic characters or disgusting villains . this book lacked both . the characters were either completely flat , highly superficial or just plain selfish . but there was nothing about them to attract our interest other than the role they played in the plot development . authors often have to choose between developing their plots and their characters . while we get lots of character development concerning the missing laurel greenwood , it 's ultimately unrewarding . the plot 's needs won , but it 's an unsatisfying victory . the book 's overall theme is about what it takes to make a good marriage . i thought that element was done well . i especially appreciated the nods to bill pronzini 's nameless detective as part of that message . but any long-time fan will enjoy the book . new fans should go back to the beginning of the series and delay this book .
