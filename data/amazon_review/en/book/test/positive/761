a work of mature genius by a great writer this under-appreciated work is slowly gaining the recognition it deserves from woolf critics ... but i would say that , since i wrote my dissertation on it ! woolf 's fiction is never light reading , but woolf lovers will here find a masterful synthesis of descriptive power , her exhaustive knowledge of english history and literature , her feminism , her passionate hatred of war and her conviction that only aesthetic experience can enable humanity to question the status quo and *perhaps* create a better world ... interested readers might consider reading it alongside the years , three guineas , moments of being , the last volumes of the diary , or such woolf essays as & quot ; thoughts on peace during an air raid , & quot ; as well as shakespeare 's tempest . this slim novel speaks volumes ; it is a work of mature genius by one of the 20th century 's greatest writers
