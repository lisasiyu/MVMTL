excellent tale of early 20th century jewish immigrant life my hope was to read a novel that gave an accurate and detailed account of the world my grandparents lived in and i was not disappointed . as with the best historical fiction , i was able to gain a sense of not just the environment and setting , but its effect on the main characters , especially david , the main protagonist . while the prose is often challenging and innovative , the book is a surprisingly easy and quick read that i could not put down . while i was often frustrated by david 's inner dialogue , the author must be commended for attempting to convey the inner workings of a child 's mind , how his thought process often chaotically bounced around from one thought to another . the author also uses language in a very unique and interesting fashion , namely the contrast between early 20th century new york slang , composed of so many different ethnic groups , to the authors `` translation '' of eastern european yiddish . for anyone currently reading the novel , who might feel frustrated at a seeming lack of direction in the plot , my advice is to keep reading , as its themes of alienation , growing self-awareness , family , sexual awakening and assimilation become more apparent as the story progresses . and for those who have yet to read the book , i strongly recommend not reading the introduction until after you 've finished the book , as it pretty much gives away almost everything that happens in the story and really should have been the afterword . regardless , it happens to be a well-written analysis of the novel and can even help the reader in his or her own thoughts and opinions of what is most definitely a classic of 20th century literature .
