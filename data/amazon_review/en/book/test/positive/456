brave man what can i say about ernie pyle ? one of the most well-known correspondents in wwii , he wrote with an empathy for the common infantryman that transcended his simple , eloquent prose . `` brave men '' is a collection of the articles he wrote while covering the war in sicily , italy , england , and france . exceedingly modest , pyle always downplayed his role while extolling the infantry fighting on the front lines , his beloved `` dogfaces . '' pyle may not have thought that he was doing anything of importance , yet his articles served to bring the war home to an american public that was being fed a somewhat sugar coated version of the war by the government ; in turn , the gi 's loved pyle as one of their own . he immortalized as many of them as he could in his articles , stating the names of the many men with whom he had contact , and often their full home address for good measure . he shared many of their hardships on the front lines , and now , more than 60 years later , his articles offer an insight into wwii for today 's readers that is as poignant now as it was then . he makes the reader feel as if we know these men personally-they are our fathers , grandfathers , brothers , neighbors , friends . impossible to put down , this book is the enduring legacy of a great man whose life ended much too soon ( after surviving the european theater , he traveled to the pacific at the request of the navy , where a japanese sniper took his life on the tiny island of ie shima , just off the coast of okinawa ) ; i would recommend this book to everyone i know with an interest in wwii
