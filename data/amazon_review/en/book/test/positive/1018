encourage children , students and selves to be the very best ordinary children , extraordinary teachers has inspired me to be a better parent and teacher to my two children . marva first let the children know that she cared about them and that she would not let them fail even when the other schools have washed their hands of the child . it was as if i were a student in marva 's class . i was so encourage to first , complete the book , i could not put it down , as i read i would practice the techniques on my children , for example my six grade son was still struggling with his multiplcations facts , he had a test to complete 100 problems in 4 min . i call my son a scholar and had him practice over and over the same test . each practice test he got better and better , he passed the test and felt really proud.he is bringing his c 's to b 's and his b 's to a 's . i learned you have to meet the child where he is . thank you marva for your care , concern , inspiration and motivation . and keep teaching and writing
