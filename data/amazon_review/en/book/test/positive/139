great and amazing item as a matter of fact , i must say my first real love was star wars chronicles , first edition from 1995 , not only because of my likeness for the old trilogy , but because of the data and images about characters , weapons , landscapes , behind-the-scenes images you can find in the great book . now i must say , i was interested in this new book just because i read the names and credentials of the authors although my interest in this new george lucas creation is not my favorite trilogy and i could say something about it . then i thought , `` well , maybe today 's young kids will love this second trilogy more than the first one , and their hearts will bit for darth maul even more than for darth vader '' . if someone had to write this book , there 's no other choice than these huge star wars knowledgemen , these fanfiles yodas . now , star wars chronicles the prequels is a `` had to be written '' book and it 's absolutelly amazing with its more than 3000 images about the prequels , all those characters , all those ships , all those light sabers ... all those worlds . now , star wars chronicles , tp has won a proudly place beside my old and dusty star wars chronicles . do n't you doubt it : this book is your next `` need to have '' . and why do n't i give it a 5 star rate ? i think chronicle books should think a bit on spanish translation for this wideworld phenomena book . i 'm absolutely sure they will reach a really important market here . darth khan
