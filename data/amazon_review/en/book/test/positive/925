you know he 's right how amusing we find the seventeenth-century minds which persecuted galileo for saying that the earth revolves around the sun . but we have living in our midst a man who is so brave he has stated a truth even more obvious than galileo 's . of course the races are n't equal . everyone knows it but we do n't want to admit it . even most scientists are so scared that they would rather pretend that natural selection leaves intelligence unaffected . the official story is that it does n't matter whether your race evolved in a jungle or a desert , the average brain will be totally unchanged by evolution . everything else will change - height , colour , blood , hair , bones , teeth , eyes - but the brain must by some undiscovered law of nature stay the same . read this book for proof of what you , in your heart of hearts , already know .
