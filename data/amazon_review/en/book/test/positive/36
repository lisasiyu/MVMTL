spectacular ! as a designer in the new york metropolitan area , i thoroughly appreciate the effort that must have gone into making this book , and in particular its illustrations . they are detailed , accurate ( as far as i can tell ) , and above all informative in a way that infrastructure diagrams from other books are not . it is noted that tw : aoac 's lead designer found inspiration in a chance encounter with famed statistician/graphic artist edward tufte - a credible claim , if this book is any indicator . conveying so much about the city yet basking in white space , these spreads are consistently excellent . ascher 's writing , too , is impeccable , and while a free-market standpoint is appropriately engaged in her commentary , the invaluabity of new york 's public bureaus is not given short shrift . indeed , where politics have clouded issues of development for the city , ms. ascher has deftly surmised the issue and given it full and fair treatment . as a major in economics and a professional graphic designer , i am happily forced to recommend this book
