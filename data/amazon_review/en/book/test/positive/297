a book that stands out among good books ! as a big military history reader i have to say this book was excellent . i do n't recommend very many books but this was great especially for people already familiar with wwii . it takes you inside the dfeat of the german army . very great observations from high ranking german officer mixed with views from the foot soldier . gives a great perspective on the german army and the internal divisions it had
