simple . straight-forward . practical . helpful . the `` bird flu preparedness planner '' delivers what it promises in a clear , compelling , straight-forward way . dr. woodsen lays out the facts of this health threat with no hype and no panic . however , it is real , it is deadly , and it is heading our way . the most valuable feature of this slim , easy-to-read manual , is its simplicity and practicality for preparedness . it has checklists of supplies , medicines , and food a family would need in case of a severe epidemic or pandemic . i will try to get tamiflu ( to help with ordinary strains of influenza ) and the over-the-counter remedies he recommends . i think the food list could have been a bit more comprehensive . i plan to have more than rice and potatoes on hand to feed a family of six for eight weeks . however my grocery list looks more like a summer cookout for a family reunion than an emergency stash . i suppose 8 cases of baked beans and 8 summer sausages is a little over-the-top .
