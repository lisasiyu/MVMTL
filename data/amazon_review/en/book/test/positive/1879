good coverage of many issues i had heard wolfe described as america 's premier social critic before i read this book . i did not come away disappointed as wolfe tackled many issues in modern life from a proper critical perspective , ignoring ideology in favor of reason . he finds the flaws in both left and right , feminism and laissez-faire capitalism . written at a level where the average reader can understand , unlike many scholarly works , this book still offers in-depth analysis . wolfe is certainly one of the more impressive authors i 've read lately
