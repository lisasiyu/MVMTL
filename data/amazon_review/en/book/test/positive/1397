highly spiritual this book is a creeper . a few months after you read it , you will realize that you love it . kerouak mentions the conceptualization of dr. sax in on the road , where jk 's main character talks about a book he is writing , and mentions the ultimate scene in sax . the story is full of visuals that stay in the mind . inspiration from bram stoker is evident , and mixes with old radio serials adventure . a coming of age story that is comic book , before comic books were cool , and with a fantastic ending that is unexpected and thought provoking . a wonderful read every time
