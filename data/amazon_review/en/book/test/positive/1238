absolutely brilliant i bought these for my daughter aged 5 , but i have found that both my 5 and 7 year are obsessed with these dolls . its 5 months now since i gave them to her , and still ( beyond one very beneficial christmas ! ) they return time and time again to hours of play with the paper dolls . needless to say , playing with the paper dolls then leads to hours of dressing up themselves like the brides..
