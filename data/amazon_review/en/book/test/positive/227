best book for christian slaves rediscovering the natural earth i really enjoyed this book.it was bound to be published , sooner or later.if the library of alexandria did not burn and collapse , society would have seen this kind of book much sooner.many rebels and magicians would have withered in the piazza 's stockades , for circulating such an explosive tome about nature.let it be published ! through christianity and islam and communism , these power structures have done nothing to promote world peace and caring for the environment.those institutions destroy the haptic pagan , who then becomes numb to the ways of nature and her earth-magick.scott cunningham has became a lightening rod for ridicule by the pudibund neo-right.the average wiccan today , was still wearing nappies , when scott passed away.he would be amazed and delighted by the growth of the old religion today . some potentially good wiccans of the 60 's were stymied by drifting into the red army faction , malcolm x 's panthers and the kirshna-moonies.this is a great beginners book for all open-minded people , who want to channel their energies in a more positive way.when one destroys an aspect of nature , one destroys part of the whole cosmic-web , in which we all live on . wicca is not about devil-worshipping , or a gateway path into satantism.nor an idle trip into lotusland.the amusing hollywood b-flicks , hash-out alot of the wrong sterotypes about true wicca.latest being the ridiculously inaccurate , '' wicker-man '' movie.use this book as a primer , and then research for more advanced wiccan studies.-as jim morrison once said , '' you 're all a bunch of slaves ! `` .so , wiccans of the earth unite ! you have nothing to lose but your chains of ignorance !
