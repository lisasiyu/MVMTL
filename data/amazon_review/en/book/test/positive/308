sad but thought provoking ... good read i had never read anything by anna quindlen before so this was my first book . i will be picking up more of her books as she proves to be a good author . the story was on an excellent subject although it did jump back and forth quite a bit . i am married and have never been in a situation like this character but the author easily made you feel the panic , fear and heart wrenching decision making in a way that made you understand the subject matter at hand with a more attentiveness to the real world .
