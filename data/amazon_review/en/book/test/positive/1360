great gift , reference , and coffee table book the original edition of this book was out of print for some years and it is delightful to see it out again , and expanded no less . it combines 2 great virtues : highly readable and informative text with illustrations of a quality that are & quot ; suitable for framing. & quot ; it is a great book for anyone who takes an interest in botany , cooking , or gardening and you could n't go wrong giving it as a gift to one of these types . it 's also great for reference . if you 're getting it as a gift i suggest ordering 2 , because you 'll want one for yourself when you see it
