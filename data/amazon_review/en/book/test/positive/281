truly a great read , but pornography it is not i love the review before mine by comiccostumes , the one line dis -- i 've read his other review of a japan anime video where he commends the `` well placed panty shots . '' i can see how bare disappointed him . pornography it is not . instead it is a woman examining sexuality , power , control and other dynamics in the context of five women that work in a seattle peep show . it is a study of a culture not many of us get to see . and , as comiccostumes learned , little of it has to do with lust for sex . for some it has to do with survival , for others power , for others simply a freedom to feel good about themselves and their bodies . for the men on the receiving end of the lap dance it must come as a real let-down .
