solid spooky laymon richard laymon is one of those writers that some people have a hard time admitting that they really like . having read over a dozen of his novels i have to agree with dean koontz that you will have a `` good time with anything he writes . '' although his plot lines tend to push the limits of probability , the strength of his characters add a verismilitude to his novels that have you wanting to believe this could happen . that is the basic foundation of this book which has six college students chasing after buried treasure in the wilderness after receiving some very accurate and very spooky instructions from a ouija board . now there are very few authors that could take such an almost lame premise like this a build a very suspenseful novel around it- but laymon , as usual , pulls it off . if you are looking for a fast-moving , in your face , page-turning novel and are somewhat willing to suspend your beliefs for a while then you will enjoy this book . i guess reading laymon is like riding a roller coaster , you just pay your money , hang on and enjoy the ride
