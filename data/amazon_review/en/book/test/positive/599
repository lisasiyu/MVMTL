the best mccarthy novel to read first a lot has already been said about this novel , so i 'll address my review to those unfamiliar with mccarthy 's work . if you 've never read mccarthy before , this is a great place to start . the plot is tight , engaging , and easy to follow , and the language is gorgeous . if you enjoy this book and want to move on to others , read the others in the border trilogy before tackling `` blood meridian . '' some people will take issue with mccarthy 's grammar , sentence structure , use of spanish , and punctuation ( or lack thereof ) . mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing , and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning . the sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and `` breath , '' meaning that they do n't always look or sound like conventional prose . this will be displeasing to some . as an example , the first line of the book reads : `` the candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door . '' now , mccarthy could have just as easily said `` the candle flickered when he entered the room , '' or something like that , but the effect , aurally , is just not the same . read the first page of the book . if you do n't catch fire at the beauty of it , then maybe this book , and mccarthy 's work in general , is not for you
