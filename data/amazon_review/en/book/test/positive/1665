invaluable ! i was in search of a good figure drawing book with an emphasis on animation and comics and this one caught my eye . after reading through , practicing the techniques and understanding them , i 'm convinced that this is the most invaluable book i have in my large collection of art books . this book completely changed the way i draw . i 've been drawing seriously for roughly 10 years and once the ideas in this book clicked , it made me feel as if i 'd been drawing the wrong way for all those years . well worth the 17 bucks or whatever it was i payed for it . i would n't recommend this book to beginners however . it 's not really a how to draw or a book that covers basic proportion and anatomy issues . for somebody to get the most out of this book , i think they 'd need to have a solid grasp on anatomy and fundamental drawing techniques . on the other hand , a beginner may benefit from this book simply from a gesture standpoint . easily a 5 out of 5 for me
