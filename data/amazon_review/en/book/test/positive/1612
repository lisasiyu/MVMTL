5 stars but not my favorite of course it deserves five stars because of the great author , knowledge of chinese culture , good characters and wonderful story . it involves the delicate balance between the old chinese customs of ancient medicine vs science , the choosing of ones own mate vs the old custom of parents making the choice . in this case , the family is not peasant but prominent , but the culture just as interesting . there is no action in this book but more of a love story . no peasants trying to survive in poverty but a cast of the entitled and a struggle of wills .
