love lor the living by dan saferstein phd i was touched by the sensitivity , wisdom and honesty of the writer . while written in an easy readable style , it 's a book that goes to the core of human needs and feelings : love , pain , understanding , belonging and other . i appreciated dr. saferstein 's approach to relationships often from the woman 's point of view.at times it seemed that it was a woman 's voice speaking to me . reading about the writer 's personal life , i found many subtle lessons to apply to my own life . i found it uplifting that grief at the death of his younger sister resulted in a new reawakaning to all the things that were dear to him . it made me reflect on my relationships and what was important to me in life
