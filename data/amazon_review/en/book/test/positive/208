excellent reference tool this is an indispensible reference tool whether you are just fascinated by food and drink and all things related or need information for backgrounding purposes . i have found it very useful . ( did you know that dr. pepper was created by a pharmacist from waco , texas in 1885 ? ) the appendixes listing food websites , food museums , festivals etc . are quite helpful also . it 's well worth the cost and a `` must have '' for your libary , especially if you work in or deal with the food and beverage world . . . and if you just love knowing random trivia you 'll love having these volumes to thumb through !
