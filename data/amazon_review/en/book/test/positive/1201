mind-bending fred alan wolf does a good job of explaining the latest thinking in quantum physics , which he himself concedes to be impossible for us to visualize in many respects , for readers without scientific training . he does this by adopting a historical approach , following the evolution of man 's understanding of the nature of motion from the speculations of early greek philosophers such as zeno and aristotle through the work of ground-breaking physicists such as einstein and bohr up to the most current knowledge about the crucial importance of the observer in determining reality . wolf includes some mind-blowing speculations about the nature of human consciousness in the quantum universe which should fascinate you even if you find them difficult to accept
