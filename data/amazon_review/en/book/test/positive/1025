buckland de-jargonises the field of ai this book is my masters thesis . i built a multi layered combative system driven wholly by neural networks evolved using genetic algorithms . the learning of agents was unsupervised and they existed collaboratively and adversarily . if all of this made no sense , dont worry ! read this book and it will . the book covers these techniques ( except for multi layered architectures ) to a level understood by anyone with a basic knowledge of c++ . it totally demystifies nns and gas . other books on these subjects actually put you off the entire concepts of ai by feeding you fear and confusion . i have completed the book and have read it numerous times . it is going to be invaluable for my development of phd stuff - his writing introduces areas for potential research . im would definately buy other books from this author . i hope he covers other areas of ai soon and puts 'em into print . be jaysus , tis mighty i tell ya ! !
