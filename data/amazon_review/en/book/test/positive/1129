delightful sophistication this textbook could be used by college creative writing students just beginning the study of writing poetry as well as advanced students , honing voice , craft , and expressive forms of poetry . wendy bishop writes a friendly , well-organized textbook that makes learning sophisticated poetic techniques enjoyable . this trade paperback is a fairly big book 9.09 x 6.28 x 0.83 , with 437 pages , presenting a wealth of material in an interesting and accessible manner . chapters are organized by `` forms , '' broadly conceived as patterns of sound , rhythm , and meaning . such forms include free verse , metered lines , rhymed and unrhymed couplets , elegies and aubades , ghazals and pantoums , haiku and haiku-like sequences , listing and repetitions , odes and praise songs , prose poems , quatrains , sestinas , sonnets , tercets , terza rima , triplets , and villanelles . each chapter begins with a clear discussion of professional examples of the form . next model poems are considered to move from `` reading into writing . '' then an extensive and expansive series of `` invention exercises '' appear , containing drafts of poems by students based on the exercises with additional professional examples . i give my highest recommendation to this text for students of poetry
