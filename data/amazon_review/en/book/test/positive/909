child-directed cooking from age 4 to age 7 , my daughter has greatly enjoyed cooking from this book . unlike when we cook together from other cookbooks or recipes , when we cook from this book , she can really take the lead , and i am her assistant . at age 7 , she is able to make some of the items entirely on her own . using this book has encouraged her to take an active role in preparing foods for our family and dinner guests . she takes pleasure and pride in her creations , because she worked hard and they taste good ! because of the thoughtful design of the book , the child does n't have to be able to read to figure out what to do , with a little parental help . the recipes included are healthful and tasty . the drawings and layout are appealing to children and adults . i highly recommend this book to families with children from preschool through at least second grade to get your children into the fun of cooking . enjoy !
