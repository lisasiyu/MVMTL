you really need to purchase this one ! i could not put this one down . the autism spectrum is so diverse and difficult to understand . this book allows one to get into the mind of a child with autism and get a grasp on how he/she perceives the world around them . things we say and do on a regular basis , are perceived very differently to someone with autism for a variety of reasons which this book covers . activities that we may enjoy , sometimes , are simply too much , even nausiating at times for someone with autism . these `` ten things '' that the book mentions , really opens ones eyes to a whole different way of understanding and interacting with an individual with autism . it really showed me better ways to communicate with them . for anyone at all that has or is working with someone on the spectrum , you need to read this book . it will help you to be more sensitive and them better . thank you for this book
