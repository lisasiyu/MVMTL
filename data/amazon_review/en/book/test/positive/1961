concise , 1-book review for step 2 . this book was more than helpful for step 2 . in particular , it helped me polish up on dermatology , ophthalmology , neurology , and radiology - subjects not well covered in the other review books i used , and subjects which had an appreciable presence on usmle step 2 . it also helped me review ob/gyn at the last minute . look out for errors , though - others in my class found flaws in the medicine section , for example . otherwise i 'd give it 5 stars . worth the price for all the high-yield information packed in this little green book
