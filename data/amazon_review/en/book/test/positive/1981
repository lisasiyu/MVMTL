very believable ! this book seriously makes you think . not only is it suspenseful , it 's a teen angst novel , too . it shows you what happens when peer pressure goes too far . the characters are belivable , and sometimes you hate them , and other times , you wish that they 're your best friend , especially mark , who later on in the book has a suprise secret that will leave you in a cold sweat
