always lower prices - but at what cost ? this is the central question in featherstone 's treatment of the dukes v. wal-mart stores , inc. class action lawsuit . focusing on depositions , sworn testimony and direct personal interviews , featherstone gets right to the heart of her subject in the first chapter . the anecdotal evidence , supported by ample statistics , demonstrates that something is , indeed , awfully wrong with wal-mart and the disparate ways in which it treats its workers . as important as the gender discrimination issue is the consideration of how wal-mart has , and will continue to , build its fortune off the backs of the working poor . given enough time , it is entirely possible that certain areas of the country will be economically drained , committed to an addiction of buying at and working for wal-mart . it is the low-price panties version of a super size me world . worst of all , however , is the company 's documented practice of referring its own workers to social service agencies , to apply for benefits they need because wal-mart neither provides sufficient benefits nor pays employees enough to afford them . puts a whole new spin on the phrase `` corporate welfare . '' where is the politicians ' indignation over this abuse of the welfare system ? well researched and well documented with references and notes . one latter chapter does tend to slow down with emphasis on legal citations and stats , but this is necessary to put a factual basis behind the personal stories . whether you are against wal-mart , a wally-world fan or a blissfully unaware consumer , you can not read this book and remain unaffected in some manner . if it does not turn you completely away from shopping there , it should at the very least give you pause before opening your wallet .
