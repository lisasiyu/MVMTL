an excellent story this book is one of the best i 've ever read . i rarely sit for an entire day to read a book but i just could n't stop reading . mr. richardson starts by explaining the culture of the yali tribe , then moves to the life and background of stan dale . seeing the providence of god at work as the third part brings the yali tribe and stan dale together is remarkable . stan dale 's conviction , comittment , and compassion is something to inspire any believer concerned with spreading the gospel of jesus christ
