the rotten fruits of postmodernism this book examines the zeitgeist or spirit of the age , points out what is wrong with it and how to reverse the destructive trend . the modern era is taken as the period 1789 - 1989 and the post-modern as the one that followed . the west is currently in the grip of the pomo mindset , more so in europe than in the usa . whereas reason was held as the highest value under modernism , it has been ridiculed by postmodernism where truth is considered to be extinct . purpose and design were emphasized in modernism , but postmodernism emphasizes chance and randomness . the post-modern spirit considers values as relative and celebrates unreason and the loss of meaning . deconstruction and contradiction are its gods . although the modern pursuit was inhospitable towards spiritual truth , debate was still possible because information was subject to induction and deduction . in the post-modern mentality the purpose of debate or dialogue is not to discover truth , since here facts have no legitimacy . debate is therefore impossible . the first section of the book is titled the moods of the present ; it explores the ideas and circumstances that gave birth to the current cultural struggle . the author rigorously investigates the pomo mindset in the light of the fruits it has borne . this part contains interesting references to sources as varied as the great divorce and the pilgrim 's regress by cs lewis , the thoughts of gk chesterton and even song lyrics by the moody blues ( question ) and carly simon ( playing possum ) . the second section looks at voices from the past , those that have shaped western culture down the ages . as postmodernism mocks the promise once offered by modernity , religion comes under even greater assault , partly because of the faults of politicised religion . theocracy is not the answer . the real hope lies in a change of heart in the individual . this section includes the poem ozymandias by percy bysshe shelley and an interesting quote by peggy noonan , among others . the author discusses the history of manasseh , son of hezekiah . manasseh turned out to be one of the most evil kings in the history of ancient judah . he was a practitioner of `` multiculturalism , ' introducing hideous habits like infanticide from the surrounding nations . zacharias provides a frightening description of what these sacrifices of children to moloch must have been like . it shows how one person can lead millions into evil , when a nation ceases to think clearly . after manasseh , the righteous king josiah led the kingdom of judah back to god again . section 3 explores the mystery of evil , with reference to the trial of eichmann and popular culture like the movie pulp fiction in which murder is trivialized . the beautiful poem the coming by r s thomas is reproduced here , and the grace of god and the invitation to redemption are discussed . appendix a : the ineradicable word is a defence of the uniqueness and authority of the bible , a brilliant apologetics for the veracity of the message in our judeo-christian scriptures . it deals inter alia with the transcultural nature of truth and the transformation of the soul . appendix b : inextinguishable light , deals with the structure of reason , certainty and the matter of absolutes . it includes a quote from malcolm muggeridge warning of the spiritual plague of relativism . it explains the relationship of logic - reason - truth and the word as truth in the battleground of the heart . the book concludes with an annotated bibliography of the bible , notes by chapter and a study guide with questions to use as a workbook . i also recommend sinisterism by bruce walker , while europe slept by bruce bawer , menace in europe by claire berlinski , the dragons of expectation by robert conquest , the force of reason by oriana fallaci , the west 's last chance by tony blankley and our culture : what 's left of it by theodore dalrymple .
