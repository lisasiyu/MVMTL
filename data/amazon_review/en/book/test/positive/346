not pocket sized , but very good this book is awesome because it teaches . i learned so much about what to look for ( and what to avoid ) while shopping . for years i thought i was `` cursed '' with an hourglass figure . then i found this book and learned that i was trying to dress as if i were built like kate moss . now , i buy the fashion magazines and look more at the shape of the clothing instead of the look it has on the model . i went from feeling dumpy and unattractive to sexy . i have been a bargain hunter for years , and the pocket stylist has helped refined my tactics . i still buy $ 30 shoes and $ 15 pairs of jeans when i come across them , but now i buy the ones that i *know* will work into my wardrobe . hello , functional closet . goodbye , `` i have nothing to wear ! '' my dislikes about this book ? it 's only pocketsized if you carry a large bag , which i do not . also , the author could be more descriptive . i have no idea what the difference is between an a-line skirt and a circle skirt , and her book does nothing to educate me on the subtleties between the two
