tripoli and early american foreign policy this book was my first exposure to the barbary pirates and that era of american foreign policy . it is a terrifically interesting period of american history . america , the young nation dealing with foreign policy issues in north africa where local muslim powers are capturing ships and demanding ransom . the bashaw of tripoli and his history with the politics of that region in the early 1800s is rendered more relevant given current events . it is a truly human read with the strengths and weaknesses of those portrayed exposed . this is not sugar coated american history , be advised .
