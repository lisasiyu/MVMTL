a solid read if you have any weakness in remembering the acccomplishments of the golfers from the twenty 's , thirty 's , forty 's and fifty 's , this book will be invaluable . it is also a fun read and has an interesting twist at the end . the book cover suggests it is a combination of grisham and finestein . that is a bit of hyperbole , but it is a well done piece of writing and one which golfers and non-golfers can relate to . worth picking up
