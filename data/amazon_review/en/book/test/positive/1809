nan is a character full of flaws - as well as heart - who will stay with you year-round . twenty-eight-year-old nan cloutier always thought that , by the time she was twenty-five , she would be living a posh , fabulous life in manhattan , with a great job , an even greater wardrobe , and the guy of her dreams by her side . three years later , and nan still has n't achieved all of the above , and then some . for nan 's so-called `` posh '' job is working for seasonal staffers , inc. a corporation where she has held positions as a cindy-lou who impersonator , easter-egg carrying girl in bunny suit , and valentine 's day purple box of chocolates , among other , much more humiliating titles . which is why nan is desperate enough to tell a little white lie . while posing as cindy-lou who at the merrier-iverson department store christmas display , nan tells her boss - mr. iverson - that she can speak french , and pretends to converse with a french child , reciting her christmas list to the english-speaking grinch . after much praise , nan is beaming from ear to ear , but her smile slowly fades when mr. iverson falls and breaks his leg - the fault of nan , of course . quickly getting canned from her seasonal staffers position , she is offered a new job - by mr. iverson - one that involves baby-sitting his grandson , colm . however , upon meeting , nan quickly realizes that colm is actually her age , and that mr. iverson was actually playing `` matchmaker '' for his grandson , and thinks that the two will make the perfect couple - once they work out a few bumps in the road . i have read many of naomi neale 's ya books - published under the name naomi nash - which is why i was extremely eager to experience one of her adult chick lit books for myself . i was pleasantly surprised , for , from page one , i found nan 's character to be amusing , what with her somewhat ... unusual career choice , and the wisecracks she litters throughout all of her observations on being a seasonal staffer , and life , in general . she is the ideal protagonist and keeps you laughing from beginning to end , while the many bizarre people in her life will take readers by surprise - a pleasant one , of course - and lead them on a trip down lover 's lane . neale has done an amazing job of weaving together a tale filled with smart characters , witty storylines , and an emotional roller coaster to top it all off . nan is a character full of flaws - as well as heart - who will stay with you year-round . erika sorocco book review columnist for the community bugle newspape
