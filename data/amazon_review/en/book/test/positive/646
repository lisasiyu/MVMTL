insightful review - by jameson thottam i purchased this book as a good primer for entering banking ( specifically indymac bank ) . when i joined retail banking ( previously only having worked in investment banking at morgan stanley ) i was able to expand my knowledge on various areas of the retail banking beyond just what i-banking had taught ( e.g. , , valuation , sec ii & sec iii stat techniques , tax implications and flippying and insider trading tips of how to find/negotiate the best properties ) . i would highly recommend this book to others in this field . - jameson thottam
