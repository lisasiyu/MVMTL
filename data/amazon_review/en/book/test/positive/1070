hilarious and heartbreaking having skimmed the reviews on this site it is apparent i am not the only person who decided the world according to garp was worth re-reading after 25 years . the world according to garp is ultimately about lust and its destructive nature . if you are easily offended ( irving 's novels tend to revolve around twisted sexual behaviour and garp is no exception ) you may want to avoid the world according to garp ( and pretty much everything in the irving catalogue ) . but the world according to garp is more than a series of bizarre sexual encounters . it is a complex , disturbing , and insightful novel . in the world according to garp , irving has created some of the most vivid , unique , and truly memorable characters in modern literature , not to mention some of the best lines of dialogue ever put to paper . the world according to garp is both hilarious and heartbreakingly poignant . i do have to admit that i did find ( as i often find with irving 's novels ) that it meanders a little in the middle ( i could have done with a little less on the wife-swapping relationship for example ) . even though some plot lines did n't engage me as thoroughly as others , all in all , the world according to garp is a well written , enormously entertaining novel . if you have n't read anything by john irving , the world according to garp is a great place to start . if you read the novel years ago , its well worth reading again .
