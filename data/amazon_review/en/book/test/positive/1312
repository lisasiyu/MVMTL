play rhymes the illustrations are beautiful . the pictograms give parents great ideas to improvise , and create new movements . my 11 month-old baby enjoys the rhymes , even though she is not yet old enough to follow my moves as i sing or recite them , she tries to imitate me . we have a great time together and you can always get a smile from her when we sing & quot ; wheels on the bus & quot ; or & quot ; i 'm a little teapot. & quot ; fantastic book ! !
