return of charles johnson mr. gilkerson has written something wonderful here ; even 50 pages in and at the tender age of 40+ i was enjoying the ride . this is one fun book to read , and aside from some of the nautical terms used , seems very appropriate for an early adolescent . also , as a hobby pirate historian , i can fully appreciate what the author has done in providing a background for the history of piracy in his narrative . he has provided this history in what i consider to be a very engaging manner ; a manner that will drag the younger reader along entertainingly and educationally . three hundred plus pages later , i was just as engaged as the author wound up his narrative . there are only a couple of minor things that could have been included to help the young reader : 1 ) a glossary of terms , 2 ) a labeled image of ship rigging , and 3 ) a collected bibliography for further reading . in the end , those are fairly minor points when considered in the context of the overall entertainment value of the book . my hearty thanks to william gilkerson for entertaining me with this splendid tale . p-
