`` i 've already told you that i believe in nothing . '' ivan turgenev 's novel `` fathers and sons '' examines the emerging generation gap that reflects the growing changes in 19th century russian society . when the novel begins middle-aged widower nikolai petrovich kirasnov is waiting for the return of his son arkady . arkady , who has just graduated from university , returns with his close friend the nihilist , medical student bazarov . bazarov is the son of a retired army doctor , and he comes from a humble , yet vital background . while bazarov embodies the ideals of nihilism , arkady 's belief system seems to be a pale reflection of his friend 's . arkady 's foppish effete uncle , pavel , a former army officer , is deeply disturbed by bazarov , and sees bazarov and his belief system as a personal affront . the novel begins in 1859 -- right before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 -- and a significant shift is taking place in russian society . the relatively enlightened kirasnov has freed his serfs , and he 's attempting to adjust to employing people who can produce . the management of his estate , however , is problematic . kirasnov has an illegitimate child with a peasant girl he refuses to marry because of the differences in their social status , and the girl , fenichka and her child live in one of the back rooms of the house . fenichka 's role is a peculiar one -- she 's obviously kirasnov 's mistress , but she 's also a servant within the household . kirasnov and his brother pavel are `` men of the old school '' -- whereas bazarov and to a lesser degree arkady represent the new wave of thought -- nihilism . bazarov `` does not look up to any authorities ... does not accept a single principle on faith , no matter how highly that principle may be esteemed . '' both bazarov and arkady find their nihilist beliefs under assault when they fall in love . bazarov , who believes that the `` study of personalities is a waste of time '' and that `` all people are alike '' finds himself inexplicably falling in love with the elegant , cold , elusive widow anna odintsova . while anna is immensely attracted to bazarov , she can not allow herself to engage in any passionate affair . he threatens her passionless , ordered world , and she threatens his nihilist beliefs . but falling in love is just the first of bazarov 's problems . he also discovers that prolonged exposure to the kirasnov family is a contaminating influence , and he tells arkady , `` that 's what comes of living with feudal lords . you 'll become a feudal lord yourself , before you know it , and take part in knightly tournaments . '' bazarov is a marvelous , strange and unforgettable character , and `` fathers and sons '' -- one of the seminal novels from the period -- is a must for russophiles . as a companion piece , i recommend `` nihilist girl '' by sofya kovalevskaya -- displacedhuma
