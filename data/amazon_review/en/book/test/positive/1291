insightful and practical this is a great book . dahut 's analysis of the mindset of the lawyer as he goes about marketing and managing his practice is frighteningly accurate - the way we think as lawyers clearly restricts our ability to be good enterprise builders . dahut 's discussion on law firm branding and leadership building was right on the money . i would recommend this book highly to other lawyers - in fact , it should be required reading in law schools . finally , while the book is a little on the pricey side , i got my money 's worth and then some . i give this book five stars .
