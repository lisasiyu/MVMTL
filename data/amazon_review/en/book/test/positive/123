transcendant translation a writer who undertakes to translate a complicated and nuanced work by an acknowledged literary master puts himself into an unenviable position , especially should the work have already been previously translated by another and be considered definitive . and yet heim 's update on the classic lowe-porter translation has made mann 's aschenbach more fully human , more tragic and less comic , still every bit as pompous and self-justifying , more insidiously real . it 's a triumph of the translator 's art . to me , anyhow , mann 's book has always been at least as much about the language , the inner self-talk of aschenbach , as it has been about the story line or plot . it is fascinating to see how the author enters the mind of a man who has spent his life in rigid self-denial , self-deception really , and slowly - and not without considerable struggle from his ego against it - expands his consciousness . by book 's end aschenbach has not only found himself , he can no longer deny himself , he accepts himself as he is and then of course he dies . the journey he undertakes - not just from serious and constricted germany to a holiday resort on the lido in venice , but from stuffy and self-important man living a lie , a life of 'despites ' , to allowing himself to be fully conscious of one true emotion and impulse and allowing it , even willing it to take him entirely over , to free him from himself , is the thing . well , it 's a spellbinding book , and one which rewards close rereading
