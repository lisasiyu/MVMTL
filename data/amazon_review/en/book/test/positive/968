informative and precise instructions this book was such a relief because it covered classroom discipline , from the beginning , without talking down to the reader . the chapters are organized so that you can implement the methods right away , in a useful sequence without becoming overwhelmed . you need to read this book if you fear you are a pushover in the classroom . i have used these methods in a multicultural classroom with more than half of my students as non-native english speakers . it really works ! there is a tremendous feeling of respect between everyone in the classroom . i was especially pleased with the effect on one of my students who was severely abused as a child and who grew up very untrusting in foster homes , etc . in september , he was violent with himself and with other children , striking classroom objects or people when he was angry . other teachers are amazed at how much he has changed since the beginning of the school year . i owe so much to the advice in this book
