light and entertaining read i bought this book after i became acquainted with mitford sisters through a biography i have read . after reading the biography , the first novel , `` pursuit of love '' seemed very familiar to me because in some parts it is almost a narration of the mitford history . some characters are given a different history but it is easy to recognize jessica or nancy herself . i would n't go so far as to call these novels masterpieces but they are very witty and enjoyable . especially if you are an anglophile like me , you will most certainly enjoy this humorous depiction of upper class society in england . both novels are narrated by fanny , cousin/friend to the heroines of the novels . `` pursuit of love '' is about linda 's love affairs and `` love in a cold climate '' is about polly 's scandalous marriage . both novels contain very enjoyable side characters like the bellowing uncle matthew , the health-conscious uncle davey and the lovable sissy cedric hampton . in fact the leading ladies are not explored so well as these characters . in the case of polly we know very little about what goes in her mind . i must also note that these novels are more about characters than plots . nancy mitford writes along about the characters and when there is nothing more to say , she abruptly ends the novels . besides if you have n't read them one after the other , some of the points fanny makes will be quite irrelevant as in the case of fanny 's meeting fabrice in `` love in a cold climate '' and mentioning that she will be adopting his son years later . first novel 's heroine linda is just a distant character in the second novel but the other , funnier characters appear in both novels . all in all an enjoyable read but do not expect a literary masterpiece
