and now for something completely different i bought this book with low expectation for both the poetry and the story . i 'm happy to say that i was wrong . emperor 's babe is sexy , stylish and just the most original book i 've read in ages . the heroine is a tough little customer , a hip afro roman living in londinium who meets the man of her dreams and loses everything else . by the time you come to last page i promise that you will be moved by her story
