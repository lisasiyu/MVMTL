great go-to book i originally got this book when i first moved out on my own . i had some cooking experience which i gleaned from my mother , but with a limited spread of recipes and without much on-my-own experience . this book helped me a great deal as a beginner cook , and taught me most of the basics . years later , i 'm a much better cook , and though i rarely use this book 's recipes at face value , i often reference it for a guideline to dishes that i enjoy , while adding my own touches . also , when i 'm preparing to try something new , this is generally the first book i go to , even after all this time . other cook books have come and gone , but this one has staying power for me , earning it its five stars . a great purchase for a young adult , or even an every-day cook who just is n't very good , or who has a limited array of recipes . it is also a great reference for anyone who just wants a base to branch out from
