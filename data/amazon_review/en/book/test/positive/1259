a perfect edition this is an unbelievably great edition of the canterbury tales . all i wanted was the original , complete version with definitions for archaic words . but the penguin classics edition was all i could find , so i got it . it comes with over 500 pages of extras ! ! ! super-detailed notes , a great glossary , and lots on chaucer , his times , literary genres , etc. , etc . multiple interpretations are given for parts scholars do n't agree on . i ca n't believe i paid $ 80 for the riverside chaucer in college ! ... which i later sold back for much less . this edition blew me away , and it 's relatively cheap . if you have n't read chaucer and want to read him in old english , it 's tough at first , but it gets easier with practice . there are long tales , short tales , noble tales , bawdy tales , etc . if you just want to read a few , there are cheaper paperbacks with just a few . if you want the complete tales but not the essays and things , they exist , but they 're more expensive than this edition
