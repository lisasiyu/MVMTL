bravo ! this book is amazing . it explains every energy principle before explaing how to use it . it gives the necessary understanding for both left brained and right brained people . personally , it gave me the missing piece about manifesting : how to eliminate the inner `` chat '' or `` noise '' that prevented me from focusing in what i wanted . it is an excellent reference bor beginners and advanced reality manifestors . it also gave me many advanced techniques for creating and manifesting thoughts in an easy to understand language but yet in a very inspiring and powerful way . i have a big pile of excelent resources on the topic , but i definetely need to give an standing ovation to `` professional dreamer '' . it is really a must . the results are astounding
