throught provoking concept i have to say , a lot of people will find this book to appear unbiblical if they do not know their scriptures exceptionally well . the scriptures do not say , `` the 2nd coming is the final coming '' - otherwise the dispensational millenialists ( `` left behind '' ideology ) would really be in trouble since they have at least 2 returns of christ , the `` hidden '' rapture before the tribulation ( book 1 in the left behind series ) , as well as the `` glorious appearing '' ( the final book in the left behind series ) . this book is a good example of what theologians ( like myself ) refer to as `` speculative theology '' - theology based not on what scripture says , but what scripture has not discussed one way or the other . he asks the question : could christ have an `` intermediate return '' before the `` glorious appearing , '' but nothing like what the `` left behind '' ideology is projecting ? could the current state of israel be about bringing forth this intermediate return , and not the final one ? or could it have nothing to do with the final return ? all these questions are thrown out there for the reader to contemplate and consider . excellent piece , well worth the money
