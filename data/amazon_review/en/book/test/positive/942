wonderful , imaginative my five-year-old son loves this book . the first time , i read it out loud to him and his sister . he has read it alone several times since then . i think the writing is right on his level - he has tackled tougher books but not gone back to them like this one - and it is long enough that he does n't finish it in fifteen minutes . the story sounds to me just like something a kid would think of - for example , how elmer crossed the river full of crocodiles . i also asked my son what he liked about it , and he said , `` dragons . '' he might have given a longer answer if he had n't been busy reading the book at the time
