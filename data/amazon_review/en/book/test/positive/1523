excellent arguments from a brilliant writer walter e. williams is extremely gifted in his ability to present an argument . in more liberty means less government , williams presents short articles that he has written ( ranging from 1995 - 1997 ) , each of these articles is a beautifully orchestrated example of the perfect argument from start to finish . not only does williams present a convincing argument for each topic , but he adjusts his balance of pathos , ethos , and logos depending on the topic he asses . when discussing many potentially controversial topics such as school vouchers or education reform , williams first seeks to establish himself as a credible source on the topic , and frequently brings in more than one real life source on the topic . william 's does n't just quote some professor 's work on education , he refers to the owner of a small private school in his area and her opinion on how to solve the problem of our dismal education schools . due to his brilliance of mind and communication , williams is incredibly effective in presenting his political agenda , and creates a masterpiece in more liberty means less government
