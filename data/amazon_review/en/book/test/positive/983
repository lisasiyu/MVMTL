excellent reading i read the true story of the my lia massacre when it first came out , and then knew why when we came back we were called baby killers . now that i have read this book on my lia i wonder how they let something like that happen and what makes me mad is that nothing more has been done about the people that done it all . i personelly think that all the people that took part should be put in jail and left there , but other then that it was an excellent book to read
