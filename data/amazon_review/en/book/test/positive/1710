go out on a good note i 've just reread `` the cat who smelled a rat . '' in it , jim qwilleran is still in fine mettle . this mystery , no . 23 in the `` cat who '' series , is the last one most fans will enjoy . in this book , qwill still remembers small details from previous novels . he 's still interested in the mysteries around him , and he does some active snooping around . he 's still a bit of the lothario despite himself . and he still has faith in koko 's awesome powers . starting with the next book , the mystery gets solved almost by accident . qwill becomes a parody of himself , and the novels start to get worse and worse . eventually , the books begin to get facts wrong and characters begin to act , well , out of character or just inexplicably drop out of sight . ( the latter must be hard to do in a small town 400 miles north of anywhere . ) whether lilian jackson braun , now approaching 90 , has lost her touch , or whether they 're being ghost-written , i leave to you to judge . but the books become just dreadful . i recommend that readers go out on a high note and stop after no . 23 . it 's been a good run
