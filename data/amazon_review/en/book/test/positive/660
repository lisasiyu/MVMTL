great for teachers of drama too ! not only useful for the & quot ; serious adult & quot ; improv artist -- as a drama teacher who works with underprivileged kids i find this the best book out there for helping them develop a sense of & quot ; mastery & quot ; on stage , a drama more alive to them than memorizing lines . recommended for anyone who works with young actors
