starts slow but ends with an unexpected bang jonathan kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years , particularly the alex delaware novels . this - non-delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end . the only reason i did n't give it a 5 star rating is because of the slow beginning . i even put it down a time or two thinking i 'd never get where he was going , but i 'm glad i persisted . it turned out to be very well worth it . this is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim . eh ? got the hairs standing up ? he is befriended ( in an odd circumscribed manner ) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening . as the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he 's not sure who to ascribe them to . this is a well plotted , very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning . kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery . loved it !
