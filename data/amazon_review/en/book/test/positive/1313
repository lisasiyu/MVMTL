marshmallow today , gone tomorrow ? this book changed my old habits and tomorrow i 'll have two marshmallows ! my aunt recently came to visit me and strongly suggested i read your `` do n't eat the marshmallow ... yet ! '' book along with the motivational mini book . since reading the book ( just two days ago ) , one effect your book had on me was to set up a savings account that will transfer funds from my checking account twice a month . my aunt , along with your book , also inspired me use passages and quote some lines that i am using for my midterm paper . i wanted to thank you for the inspiration and additional motivation ( that i yes needed ! ) . i am continuing the domino effect and am recommending this book to my friends and even my boss . i will continue re-reading this book and adopt the marshmallow theory/delayed gratification as my own . i strongly believe this has provided a positive change in my life that i will repeatedly profit from
