a conrad reader 's favorite joseph conrad is my favorite author , and i 'm close to having read everything he 's written . this is my favorite novel . i 've read the criticism , that it 's too sentimental , that its characters are n't as rich as in other conrad tales ... bumpkis . consider schomberg , consider heyst ... well , unless you 've read the novel of course you ca n't . i encourage you to . i 've read that it was conrad 's favorite , and one can understand why , in heyst we get a glimpse into the soul of the aloof author , and in the memorable final word of the novel we get an impression of what he saw in the world . no other conrad novel with the possible exception of lord jim has so personally affected me , and if like him , and like heyst , you have sloughed off sentimentality , abandoned your romantic side , then maybe this novel has something to teach you . i certainly learned something
