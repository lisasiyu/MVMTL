shamanism in europe yes , ginzburg actually contends that the so-called & quot ; witches & quot ; of old europe were in fact remanents of the old shamanic cultures of europe , and he does make an excellent arguement for it . i will admit , i do agree with him on some points . shamanism is a universal phenomena , and yet ( with the notable exception of the lapps in scandinavia and a few scattered myths and legends like orpheus and odin ) shamanism seems to have all but been absent in europe , and this has always puzzled me . certainly , had shamanism been widespread in europe , it probably would have survived well into the christian era , just as it has in other parts of the world . as such , ginzburg may be right on the money about the witch hunts and such . regardless of your thoughts on the subject , this remains an excellent book . and if you like it , he has another book , entitled & quot ; night battles & quot ; about a community of shaman in northern italy
