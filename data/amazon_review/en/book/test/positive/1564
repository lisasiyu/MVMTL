modern navy pilots have become push-button warriors `` the killing sky '' is the fifth book in robert gandt 's great series of novels about brick maxwell , and it 's one of the two best . ( my other favorite is `` acts of vengeance '' , the second book in the series . ) brick maxwell is a u.s. navy pilot and squadron leader , flying an f/a-18 super hornet off the aircraft carrier uss ronald reagan , stationed in the eastern end of the mediterranean sea . the story starts with a joint exercise with the israeli air force ending with an american f/a-18 getting shot down for real ! what went wrong ? did the israeli pilot really push the missile launch button instead of just announcing a simulated kill ? and why does the female israeli mossad agent make a play for brick maxwell ? is she trying to get information out of him or does she have other motives ? this book contains the same three general plot elements as most of robert gandt 's novels : - exciting `` you 're sitting in the cockpit '' descriptions of modern navy flight operations , with dogfights , carrier-based landings and takeoffs , and push-button warfare with modern smart bombs and missiles . - geopolitical machinations , this time involving high-level americans and israelis and palestinians . and to keep the excitement up there are internal conflicts within each national group , including a really nasty american political envoy with presidential ambitions . - romantic involvement for brick , this time involving not just one but two women . i liked this book a lot , despite the rather slow start . the suspense gets cranked up by the under-handed dealings going on between the politicians and the resulting armed conflicts between the palestinians , the israelis and the american forces . is the united states really going to invade palestine and engineer a democratic process , just like in iraq ? and who is really behind the decisions that are causing the continued escalation of hostilities ? one of my criticisms of robert gandt 's novels is that the characters do n't really come across as real people . this is still true in `` the killing sky '' , but less so than in the first books in the series , another plus for this book . recommended for all fans of military action novels , as is the whole brick maxwell series . rennie peterse
