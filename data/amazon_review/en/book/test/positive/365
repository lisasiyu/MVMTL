a fantastic exercise in `` what if '' this is n't really a novel and it is n't really a collection of short stories , but the vignettes are more fable than whimsy because fables are filled with lessons . alan lightman writes about many possibilities of the alternate reality of time , as he imagines einstein envisioned them . each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time : time is money , time flows uphill , live in the present - forget the past , time is motion , etc . lightman writes beautifully and his imagined realities are intriguing , each could be the setting for powerful stories . it 's a quick read , a fun read , and well worth the 'time .
