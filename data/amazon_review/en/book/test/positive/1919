hall of fame this book is a gem . it centers on two acts of betrayal , one large , one not -- yet , the small act of unkindness has remained with its perpetrator all his life . wisdom seeps out of the pores of this novel . and i must add that it 's heartbreaking to read reviews like the one below by `` jmack '' who believes that the book `` does not deliver '' -- heartbreaking to think of how many other sublime works of literature he has n't gotten . sad . in any case , do yourself a great favor and read maxwell [ who was , all his adult life , a fiction editor at the new yorker ] . after this one you can read , time will darken it and the volume of collected stories published near the end of his long life .
