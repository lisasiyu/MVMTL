highly recommended this book really made me take a step back and look at my life and how i have wasted a lot of it with meaningless task that i do n't even enjoy . it teaches you to pay attention and devote your time to the things that really matter . i highly recommend this book for anyone who like myself leads a hurried life or feels like they have forgotten what brings them joy . buy this book !
