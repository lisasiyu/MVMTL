this is not a novel ... it is the screenplay of the movie , the same one that should have won the oscar this year . for people who have n't seen the movie , reading the screenplay first may not be such a great idea . i know this movie went over a lot of people 's heads , and i 'm not positive one can fully appreciate the story from just reading it . however , i definately recommend reading it after seeing the movie , there is so much great dialogue that is easily missed and a lot of subtle humor that is more obvious written on the page . this was one of the best movies of 2001 and the screenplay is a great way to appreciate it again while waiting for the dvd
