`` the true persuasion of sexual jealousy '' : harold bloom volume iv of `` in search of lost time '' begins in the afternoon of the day of princess of guermantes 's party , the one that marcel had looked forward for so long as his definitive entrance into the world of high society . that afternoon , by spying on them , marcel discovers with his own eyes , for the first time , homosexuality , in the form of an encounter between the depraved baron de charlus and the tailor jupien , marcel 's neighbor in the property of the guermantes . later that evening , marcel attends the party , attended also by a cast of characters like very few in literature : charlus himself , a swann close to his death , and others . the dreyfuss cause keeps winning adepts , among them the very prince and princess of guermantes , as the injustice of the sentence is revealed . in the party , marcel continues on his way to disappointment about noblesse : they are people just like everyone else , only with grand names and big egos , but not much more . days later , with his mother , marcel returns to balbec , where , alone in his room he finally feels all the weight and sorrow of his grandmother 's death , which had happened a year and a half before or so . it is a profound passage about the perception of death , everyday indifference to it , and the memories left to us by our beloved 's passing away . in balbec , marcel reencounters with albertine , in that perverted play of seduction and deceit , of attraction and rejection , which foreshadows a sick relationship . disturbed by the graphic discovery of homosexuality , marcel broods a lot about it . two women who stay at the same hotel , and who openly show their lesbianism , awaken in marcel a deep suspicion about albertine 's mysterious life , and so begins a torment of permanent jealousy , of anxiety and anguish which reminds the reader of the similar episode , in times gone by , of the beginning of the relationship between swann and odette . meanwhile , marcel has simultaneous relationships with a couple of maids of the hotel ( literally simultaneous ) . marcel rents a car to go around with albertine through the countryside and the coast , deepening his relationship with the capricious , naughty , annoying and elusive albertine . in her company , he begins to frequent the little band of the social-climbing verdurins ( where swann had met odette years before ) , in the country estate they have rented from the marquises of cambremer . the central part of the book narrates that summer in balbec and its surroundings , above all the wide mosaic of characters surrounding the verdurins : insecure but arrogant doctor cottard and his simple wife ; musician vinteuil ; the rustic and silent sculptor ski ; professor saniette , pathetic and constantly humiliated ; and madame verdurin herself , presumptuous and increasingly successful in society . over this fresco is shown the repulsive couple of charlus and musician morel , son of a former servant of the prousts . morel is the worst kind of climber and representative of sexual and moral corruption . in contrast with what happens in the first three volumes , here it seems that it is the nobles who yearn to be accepted in bourgeois society , and not the other way around . it is the bourgeois who attract interesting people : intellectuals , scientists , artists . charlus makes a fool of himself big time , pretending everybody ignores his homosexuality , when in fact he is the target of cruel jokes and gossip . so continues the great saga of memory , sex , love , longing , and social observation of the xx century . like in no one of the previous volumes , in this one the subject of homosexuality is analyzed in all its complexity . marcel and albertine 's relationship forebodes hell . charlus begins to sink . the bourgeois approach triumph . like in all the previous volumes , what astounds the reader is proust 's immense power of microscopic vision to analyze individuals and dissect societies . it includes a magical reflection on dreams , as well as precious depictions of landscapes , sexual assaults , personalities and emotions
