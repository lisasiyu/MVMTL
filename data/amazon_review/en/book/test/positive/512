right ? right . it 's no secret that people who are trying to sell you something will be very careful and sometimes dishonest when it comes to the actual words and phrases they use to describe their product . in talking right , linguist geoffrey nunberg examines the use of language manipulation as it has been used in modern american politics and the effect it has had back on the language itself . since the birth of advertising , sellers would spend many hours writing and rewriting slogans , bumper-stickers and sales pitches to make sure that each word had the desired impact on the listener . but nunberg 's research is more interested not just in how language is utilized by the political salespeople , but how certain words and phrases in the vernacular have ended up being subtly changed by constant repetition and reenforcement from politicians , pundits and spin-meisters . while the word `` liberal '' is obviously where the book hangs its hat , other words and phrases have also migrated to take on different meanings and connotations . for example in a political context , when someone refers to `` values '' , they actually are only discussing a small subset of possible moral issues , regardless of their position on other subjects . even a word as old as `` christian '' is taking on a more restrictive definition . talking right is written in an easy-to-read style . it 's breezy and almost conversational without feeling shallow . i found to it be a little repetitive at times ( odd , considering the relatively small word-count ) , but i forgive it because of all the little facts that i had n't know . i had , for example , recently noticed republicans referring to their opponents as `` the democrat party '' . but i had n't realized that the deliberate shortening of `` democratic '' has been a tactic going back over 70 years . the book is told mainly from a liberal point of view . this is because of nunberg 's thesis ( and i think that most would agree ) that the right-wing has been far more successful at branding words and phrases as belonging to their side of the national discussion . nunberg picked up on a lot of things that seemed familiar to me . things that i had noticed but had n't realized that i noticed . it 's a very illuminating book in that way ; it crystallizes a lot of things i had only half-realized while listening to left-wing and right-wing talking heads exchanging insults on cable news
