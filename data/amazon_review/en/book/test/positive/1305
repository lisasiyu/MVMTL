a memorable story i am now 20 years old and have n't read this book since elementary school . today , i randomly found the book on amazon and the familiar first edition hardcover . i do n't know how old i was when i first read it , but i independently borrrowed it from the library at least 3 different times and enjoyed reading it every time . i 've always remembered , foremost , the cleverness of the dolphins and the anxiety and relief i felt every time i read the scenes with the sharks or the baby being unhooked . i would say dolphin adventure has made a positive and lasting impression upon me and that every animal-loving child should read it
