a classical if a bit dated primer on knife fighting first off , i recommend that you buy this book if you are at all interested in knife fighting . this is one of the first and one of the classical american books on knife fighting . it covers all of the basic techniques that american forces have used for many , many years . at the same time , this book is a little short on techniques , and it is entirely absent the escrima techniques that have become very popular over the past couple of decades . if you do n't look at this book as everything for everybody , you will find it a very good buy and not be disappointed . on the other hand , if you 're looking for the snappiest way to open and close your balisong , you 're going to have to look elsewhere , as this book was written before that time
