the first & final word on food crticism & life i give this memoir five stars for the the author 's curiousity , acumen and intelligence , all of which inform this wide-ranging tale . eating my words will answer your questions about mimi sheraton 's adventures as a new york times food critic , travel writer and magazine editor , as well as stints spent as consultant to venues ranging from the famed four seasons restaurant to public schools and hospital kitchens . through it all , sheraton reveals a keen intellect , a dedication to research , and a passion for accuracy . her prose is direct rather than lyrical , but the reader will emerge with a better understanding of restaurants and both admiration and appreciation for a woman and writer who has lived her life well . especially worthy savoring are sheraton 's love for her husband , richard falcone -- their marriage of 49 years gives a happy backdrop to this memoir , and sheraton 's reminiscences of her parents , who imbue her with wit , chutzpah , and lifelong curiousity about all things culinary . also welcome are sheraton 's observations about the workplace : `` it 's not your job , the employer has rented it to you , '' she observes , noting that if the job no longer suits you , it is time to quit -- something that sheraton did several times in her career , including her departure from the new york times . my appreciation for sheraton and this book grew as i progressed through the narrative . my initial four star appraisal had grown to five my the end of this memoir , chiefly because of my admiration for sheraton and her well-lived life . this is a woman who has lived with zest and integrity aned , thankfully , has chosen to share her experiences with us . we should all be so lucky
