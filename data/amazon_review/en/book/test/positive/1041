painful but essential reading sundown towns goes a long way towards explaining the us ' pervasive racial problems by examining a phenomenon many white people had thought dead and gone : sundown towns ( cities or neighborhoods where racial minorities were not allowed to live or even be present after dark ) . it would be tempting to dismiss loewen 's research as merely anecdotal , but obviously more concrete evidence can rarely be found : even the most racist townships took care to mask their anti-black and minority rules through sleight of hand and legal double speak , and city limit signs that used to warn minorities not to linger after dark have now mostly vanished , but there is simply too much material here to ignore . and the honest reader will have to admit that much of what loewen writes about sounds familiar . we 've all heard excuses for why blacks and whites tend to live separately : the blacks like it that way , they do n't care about good schools and nice houses , etc , etc . we 've also heard plenty of `` blame the victim '' stories indicating that it is black laziness and racial inferiority that prevents them from moving to the suburbs . and we 've all heard other whites making disparaging comments about minorities and not protested , thus becoming tacitly complicit . reading some of loewen 's stories about the race riots and lynchings that helped create the sundown towns , reminded me of some of the histories of the nazi rise to power in germany during the 1920s and 1930s . so many of the methods for dealing with despised groups , whether whites against blacks or nazis against jews , are terrifyingly similar : economic boycotts , terror bombings , sabotage , etc . and the language used by so called `` white patriots '' warning of the threat posed by black migration to an area reminded me of nothing so much as the screams of osama bin laden and his followers for the annihilation of the west to defend islam . ( yet another reminder that we humans are all indeed `` brothers under the skin ! '' ) i already knew i lived near one of the more infamous sundown counties , but as i read this book i began to suspect that some other communities and neighborhoods i 'm familiar with may be sundown as well , and that 's something i intend to investigate for myself . as a southerner with long ancestral roots in the former slave owning regions , i have always been aware of the dark history of race relations there . it was with some surprise ( and i hope a forgiveable amount of satisfaction at seeing such hypocrisy revealed at long last ) that i read that sundown towns were and are far more pervasive in the north and west , and that the southern states , far from being exceptions to a rule of general tolerance , were merely the most prominent examples of nationwide intolerance . loewen provides some excellent reasons for why sundown towns are bad for their residents as well as the people they keep out : the cultural aridity , the fostering of racial stereotyping , the unwillingness to try new ideas or customs . and he ably restates what the supreme court said in the brown decision back in 1954 : segregation has a degrading , scarring emotional and physical toll that makes it completely unacceptable . lowewen suggests some interesting methods for confronting and hopefully putting an end to the sundown phenomenon , including a call for a residents ' rights act that i fear will take a seismic shift in national politics to ever have a chance of becoming law . ( to start with we 'd need a president and vice-president who do n't live in sundown towns themselves ! ) more realistic suggestions emphasize action by concerned volunteers willing to research and ask the difficult questions needed to shock the many out of their complacency . this is n't a comfortable book to read , but it may come to be considered as important as gunnar myrdal 's an american dilemma in helping americans deal with the quandaries of creating a truly equal multi-racial society
