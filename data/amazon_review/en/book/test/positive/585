the images are unique ! this book was just a feature on the sunday morning show . the views of africa that this man has captured from a helicoper are very moving . i not only want to own this book i wish i could go to washington dc and see the exhibit of the original photographs . an exhibition of robert haas 's photographs can be viewed in national geographic 's m street building , october 25 , 2005 , to january 25 , 2006 . but if that is not possible buy the book
