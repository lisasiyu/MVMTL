the peripatetic mission of global unity the nomadic museum , a facility constructed onsite in various locales ( now in santa monica , ca ) out of boxcars , cartons , and pipes is in itself an artwork and the peripatetic museum houses some wispy photographs by gregory colbert of moments of world observation that in context are strangely moving . the object is to bring the spirit of mankind into a space outside the usual exhibition venues and in doing so it becomes an experience for the people . the catalogue that accompanies this show is equally impressive in its conception . no two books are alike in that they are created from handmade italian paper and bound in a cover made from unique paper from nepal . the photographs reproduced well in the catalogue languish from being reductions of the oversized images form the exhibition , but the flavor is there . images of robed children and adults , animals both alone and in tandem with humans , bits and pieces of atmosphere form a journeyman 's eye take on a significance that surpasses the original works . the catalogue for the exhibition is pricey due tot he one of a kind quality of presentation . but for those who want to forgo the expense , there is also a version of the images ( paperback with 48 pages as opposed to the 232 pages of this volume ) available through this site . if you are unable to experience the exhibition ( for that is truly what the exhibition is about ) then this art book form of the catalogue is a substantive memento of a unique artistic experience . grady harp , january 0
