technically accurate and best of the bunch william as always is able to take difficult technical topics and make them easier to understand . i have been running vista since beta one , and this book is an excellent reference for those of us already familiar with windows operating systems . he does n't waste your time and jumps right in to explanations of the most significant changes in vista and how these impact working with vista . he divides the most complex topics into easy to understand sections and truly shows depth of understanding . as an mcse i have enjoyed reading william 's books for many years . i started out with his first pocket consultant about 8-9 years ago and have been getting every one he writes since . my understanding always increases several fold while reading his books whether a completely new subject or something more familiar . he always helps you understand subjects better and his always clear and concise approach is refreshing . you ca n't lose with stanek 's books . he knows how to zero in on what 's important . he understands it and writes from experience . this is an excellent book for those of us working in it . my support and developer friends are always stealing my copy of this book
