view in the dark whoever cares about iran or persia can get something from this book . it 's not much of a & quot ; journey & quot ; in the sense of a travelog , but the conversations and the few glimpsed scenes are worth the price . the author also provides lots of interesting , scholarly background , for example , on why iranians feel so unlucky , and why the cia is a sinkhole for good ideas . maybe the saddest moment in the book was the brief chat the author had with an older iranian , who practically begged to have us should bomb the mollahs . it 's sad , not because the mollahs are human beings and should live in peace , but because the thought of the us doing something to rescue people is so old-fashioned
