herbs for hepatitis c and the liver this is an essential book for hep c. i have used the herbal protocol for 8 months and brought my viral load down to 69,000 and it is still dropping . before i read this book , i had almost convinced myself that traditional treatment was the only way , even with its horrible side effects . now , i am so glad that i found this book , contacted dry creek herb farm ( referenced in the book ) and started my daily herb treatments . the only side effect of the herb is that they do n't taste very good , but with the results i have had they are starting to taste pretty good . the cost is very affordable also . thank you stephen harrod buhrner and dry creek herb farm
