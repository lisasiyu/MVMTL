a timeless classic to compose a book set in a particular nation when you yourself belongs to a different country , it 's forever going to be an issue of debate on whether your interptretation of the culture is authentic or not . then again , your own comprehension of the nation is put under a cloud . and reliability of your understanding is a major factor . thus a novel which transcends the national boundaries and cultural restrictions is always a rare item of literature in an equally scantily elemented realm of art but pearl sydenssstricker buck 's pulitzer prize winning book `` the good earth '' set against the backdrop of a china for which the 20th . century revolution were distant rumblings of the dim future . this is a timeless , evergreen classic dressed in a transparent , empathic language and a finely woven plot which conspire to guise this dark story in a lighter hue . wang lung is a mediocre farmer ploughing his life through difficult times in kiangsu and around him `` the good earth '' revolves . pearl s. buck might be an american but in her adroit tracing of the trajectory of wang lung 's life across a vast sky of deceitful times in china , the reader fathoms the mark of a gifted writer who has come to spearhead american literature . the authoress etches a great picture of wang lung and the plethora of incidents which provide testimony to him being led on by life 's waves . wang lung marries a slave from the house of hwangs , o-lan , and along with her undergoes umpteen adventures and misadventures in life and witnesses its numerous dimensions . ove a period spanning a lifetime , wang lung and o-lan travel to and fro the dual extermities of knee-deep poverty and exotic richness and therein eflect changes in character . the farmer and his wife along with their three sons and two daughters suffer abject povety when their village is cursed by drought and famine in such a degree that they 're reduced to consuming even their ox . in search of better prospects , the protagonist takes his family to town where beggary is the sole mean to make both ends meet . in anhwei , wang lung confronts bleak situations and finds himself nothing short of a foreigner in his own country , amidst his compatiots . lung fathoms a thick delineation between the rich and the poor and finds his own rustic background a crippling factor for him to blend with the townsfolks . this is a plight that is not only shared by other villagemen who 've taken compatible measures as lung to earn their living in the town but also by uncountable such uneducated masses around the world in all ages who flock to a different landscape in hunt for better scope and in this symbolism abodes the book 's universal appeal . wang lung 's adventures in town get him enough money and when he returns to his home village , he 's already a prospering man . he buys land and cultivates myriad crops on them and gradually steps up the ladder of success and ultimately reaches the pinnacle when he and his large and everbranching family start residing in the house of hwang , the symbol of traditional landlords . but his monetary success comes at the cost of his moral notions as wang lung 's conscience , despite sustaining honesty throughout , gets absorbed in preposterous wealthy , aristrocatic fashions . lung emains unwary of his selfless , dedicated , devoted but ugly wife , '' a woman such as it is not commonly found '' , o-lan and keeps mistress and is so absurdly misled by illusions and fakes . the reader deciphers in lung a man of basic and simple foundations , at times queerly naive , tainted by misapprehensions . `` the good earth '' may be the moving tale of chinese farmer wang lung and his wife o-lan but this is not by any purpose singular or mundane in nature . pearl s. buck mirrors an essentially conservative and reserved chinese society in this her prize winning novel but , all the same , hypocratic and deeply soaked in grotesque traditionalism . the disgraceful customs of slave trade and perception of a wife as `` a faithful servant '' are a couple of features highlighted by the authoress which reverberate even today in several culturs . `` have you not heard it said that in the sacred edicts it is commanded that man is never to correct an elder ? '' the stucture of the plot has a certain symmetry about it and follows a more traditional yrt consolidatory paradigm occasioned with ghastly images of poverty , self-denial and self-improvement . but for all the exemplars pearl s. buck 's book launches , it 's not without its fair share of dewfects . a number of flaws is given the go-ahead in as early as the seventh page when the authoress remarks about `` silver dollars '' in wang lung 's village . this is a technical blunder as dollar was not a common item there then . again , the authoress is shrunk and limited in her descrioptions of a harrowing picture where sge could 've been more elaborate : '' then o-lan crept out and she took a great iron knife she had in the kitchen and she cut a grat gash in the beast 's neck , and thus she served its life . and she took a bowl and caught its blood to cook for them to eat in a pudding , and she skinned and hacked to pieces the great carcass ... .. '' . this restrained sentimentality and employment of economy of words take the sting out of the tail really . even so , these blemishes do n't overshadow at all the forcce and sensibility of the book . the mazing facet about pearl s. buck is the conviction in her language bordering on a gentle assurance of an unique tale . `` the good earth '' is an immensely haunting pre-revolutionary china novel and is extensively ambitious . the writer merges familial and social lives and interlaces them with echoes of the past , regular rhythm of the present and disturbing notions of the future . `` but there was no peace '' is a catchphrase rippled throughout the book in various overtones , be it in wang lung 's father 's placidity , in his own distress , in the distant hints of a revolution or in the first signs of christian infiltration in china . in lung 's craze for land , the reader would observe fragments of count leo tolstoy 's short story `` how much land does a man need ? '' and the disguised inevitable end . pearl s. buck 's `` the good earth '' is a riveting read , a book that borrows its classic proportions from the well-drawn characters , ranging from the honest lung to the selfless o-lan , the cunning whore lotus to the deceiving first lung son , perfectly coalesced into a social setting that is forever promising to be on the shift .
