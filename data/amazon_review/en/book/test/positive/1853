excellent revelations , but lucas should have updated it kahn did a great job in revealing vader 's , luke 's and palpatine 's motivations and thoughts . however , a glaring problem was where obi-wan tells luke about how he took him to live with his brother owen on tatooine . i know that was the original backstory , but with the prequels ' release , we all know that owen lars really is luke 's step-uncle ( since owen is anakin 's step-brother ) . lucas had the time to write that cute little preface in the re-release of this book . he should have bothered to change or at least ommit this inconsistent dialogue from the scene . this is a better storyline anyway , since obi-wan would n't have known his real brother well , having grown up in the jedi temple
