excellent great , great great ! that just sums all there is to be said about this book . with a step by step structure and structured reading this book takes you through the steps of recording , getting the album into the stores , booking concerts and managing the finances . good title for managers and musicians alike , but songwriters and producers will love it too because ti opens up lots of closed doors and gives a lot of unseen information . recommended for novices and experienced people alike , do not miss .
