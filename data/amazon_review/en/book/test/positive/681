the first , but certainly not last heinlen . prior to owning this book , i had never heard of robert a. heinlein . i must say ( sounding perverted , unfortunately ) the only thing that really drew me to this book was the cover . upon realization later , it looked somewhat similar to the statue `` venus demilo . '' as i read the book from the start , it really captivated me how detailed everthing seemed for a futuristic civilization . it almost seemed as if rah , himself , had been there and wanted to share with the world , everything that he had seen . though , mentioned in other reviews , the strong incestuous vibe the book pulls in later chapters is a slight bit of a turnoff , i feel it also adds to the story somehow . almost as if it ties into his other books from certain pivotal points . if some of the actions had not happened , the series and heritage would not have been what it was . i do mention this as the first heinlein book i had ever read , so i may have mixed it up somehow . even so , i daresay , this is a spectacular read , and should not be overlooked . that , and read the other works he has out . disappointed ? i think not
