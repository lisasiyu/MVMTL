julian cameron perseveres the third in ms. cameron 's trilogy continues her writing legacy . i 'll get my bias right out front -- i purchased dozens of `` the artist 's way '' more than a decade ago , and continue to gift friends with `` the vein of gold '' and `` walking in the world . '' hers are about the only books i buy in hardback because i know i 'll return to them again and again . it 's not just the guidance that makes her books so compelling . her phrasing , syntax , ability to draw the reader into her environment and circumstances , makes me keep coming back for more . she is a great story teller , as well as generous with her insights . that said , her third volume is a bit like watching a train wreck . especially chapter 5 , as we enter the abyss with her , i began to feel some cracks in the foundation of daily pages and artist 's dates . it appears that ms. cameron is struggling with her own advice -- `` keep the drama on the page . '' and some of us may feel our own resolve begin to crumble . but as the book progresses , the theme of perseverance certainly proves its value . those of us who feel we know ms. cameron recognize instantly why she would be walking on mental eggshells . not only is she not going back to taos this summer , but she also has chosen to close out her artist 's series with this third book . readers will miss both , and in that knowledge share a small bit of the grief that ms. cameron must be experiencing
