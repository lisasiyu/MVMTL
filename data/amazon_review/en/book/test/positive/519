good advice i thought this book had some good points . ppl should see this book as advice and not follow things so literally . i noticed many reviews , ppl did not agree with her about breastfeeding . i notice that she tries not to pressure moms into breastfeeding . after my baby was born , i felt pressured to breastfeed .
