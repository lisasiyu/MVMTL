karen rose-i 'm watching you just having discovered karen rose , i loved do n't tell , but was disapointed with have you seen her . i thought i 'm watching you was way better and i am glad i was not disappointed a second time . i 'm watching you combined all the essentials : suspense , great plot , developed , likeable characters with a past , and non-stop plot twists and turns . the romantic piece of the story was written in well , and was not overpowering as in have you seen her . i ca n't wait for rose 's next novel
