my favorite connelly book because he starts with what he knows , journalism michael connelly used to be a crime journalist . that 's why i think this mystery , which has a journalist as the main character ( a guy named jack mcevoy ) works so very well , with every scene jumping off the page and certain scenes making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up ! now about the plot ... mcevoy 's brother , a cop , is dead and the death is declared a suicide . but mcevoy does n't buy it , knowing his brother as well as he does . of course , others think he is simply in `` denial '' but as mcevoy digs deeper , suspicious patterns start to emerge , linking cop `` suicides '' with a network of pedophiles and , in particular , one pedophile , nicknamed `` the poet '' for his use of lines of poe poems , lines which he leaves at the scenes of his crimes . every chapter , every page , seems realistic , believable . i was immediately riveted and even though i did sense the killer before the final pages , it took nothing away from reading a book so well-crafted with such fine detais . connelly made me feel like i was walking around in mcevoy 's shoes , looking through his eyes . so there you have it - a bare plot outline and an opinion about a very fine writer . i do suggest you start with this book , as connelly 's quality can go up and down from book to book - or perhaps some of his works simply resonate with me more than others . this book is a top notch mystery
