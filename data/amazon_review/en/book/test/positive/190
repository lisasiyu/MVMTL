a little long , but ... ... the basic plot 's the work of a genius . roland and his tet are carriors of the task to save a `` calla '' village from an attack of so - called wolves . the task is fulfilled perfectly , so the newly grown tet 's about to move on which they 'd love to do - but ... as i said above , the basical happenings are chosen and mostly also narrated afantastically , if the author would only have kept it a little shorter . e.g . the new tet member 's self - told biography shows some details which do n't really wan na fit into the actual tower story at all ; all they show is how the guy came into this world , still midworld , of course . most of the rest , however , is told fantastically , as i said above . when eddie comes to talk to calvin tower about the house ground with the rose on it ( `` waste lands '' readers will know what i mean ) or susannah 's mind is caught by another person , differently said : detta and odetta receive company , those facts are told great ! !
