from a great teacher though the title implies it , this book is not really a sequal to the six easy pieces . they can be read seperately . it treats some of the concepts centered around special and general relativity that revolutionized physics near the turn of the century . it would be impossible to find another book that can dive so deeply into topics such as symmetry and space-time , while bypassing formalism and exposing the fundemental ideas and signficance in every-day terms . the delivery is in lecture form , and while that makes it more authentic and real , the fact that this is a book and the reader is not really in a lecture , makes it a little awkward . one often gets the feeling that one had to be there to get the full benefit . there is little attempt at explaining the historical context and other niceties and focus is solely on the concepts themselves . one needs to have at least college level math background to follow the derivations . feynman has done a phenomenal job in reducing such complex concepts into digestable pieces of conversation . there is no abstraction , everything is quantified . i especially enjoyed the chapter curved space , as i had never seen it treated so intimately . the self consistency of all these topics and how they are interrelated is elegantly presented .
