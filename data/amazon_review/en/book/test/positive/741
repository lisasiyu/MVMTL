a fantastic , compelling read in the interests of full disclosure , i should start by saying that craig and i shared an editor at macadam cage and he is a good friend . several years ago , at the national book expo , craig and i swapped copies of our books . i gave him a copy of my book `` the locklear letters , '' and he gave me a copy of `` the contortionist 's handbook . '' when he called me to meet him for dinner several months later , i felt compelled to pick his book off the bookshelf and read it . i was amazed . rarely have i found a book so compelling that i thought about it all day and felt the need to race home to read some more of it each night . it is a great achievement . original , thought-provoking , chilling .
