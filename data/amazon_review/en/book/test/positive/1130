a masterful exercise in balance . as peale was a wonderfully typical yet extraordinary enlightenment man , so david c. ward reflects these sometimes complex combinations in his multi-layered style . written with elegant poeticism yet laiden with fact and academic detail , this book is a joy to read . a wonderful balance between autobiographical insight into peale 's character and a scholarly take on 'enlightened ' american society , ward triumphally balances both the subject and the reader 's attention . by applying , for example , philosophical insight to his subject , to art and to historical events with seamless ease , ward makes a great contribution to the study of an age and a man .
