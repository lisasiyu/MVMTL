43 years later , we get to know the man , al shepard . alan shepard was the first american man in space - this occured on may 5th , 1961 with john f. kennedy in office . i find it amazing that it took 43 long years to finally get some semblence of the affair in writing . well , like the old saying goes - better late than never . author , neal thompson did an excellent job of explaining the growing up years of one of the most famous aviators in the world , alan b. shepard . he was courageous enough to print the truth about the man who was supremely confident in his physical as well as intellectual abilities . but all great men have their downfalls , as is well-documented in this book . the first man in space may have only been up there for 15 minutes , but it was this brief shining moment of accurate performing that launched the legend that is alan shepard . he conquered meniere 's disease by having to first conquer and overcome his ( bogus ) christian science faith - - - and - - - no surprise , he was cured under the famous healing hand of dr. house in los angeles . i was intrigued to discover he almost commanded apollo 13 , but was reassigned to the next mission instead , due to preparation contingencies . this decision saved shepard the near-disasterous mission that we know occured on apollo 13 - what a close call ! shepard always did display this lucky streak that never stopped . he also might have been up on apollo 1 - but his ear problem started around that time and he was grounded . it 's as if a higher power was looking out for him and doing creative things to keep shepard alive and well . his ride was on apollo 14 ; he was the commander and he did another perfect job , what else is new ? what else did we expect from alan shepard ? his wife , louise stood by his side , in good times and in bad for 50 years - she had a lot of competition out there with the rocket groupies . not to mention the stress of living with a high risk occupation . but he always managed to call her at 5:00pm most nights , except for those times he was staying at the apollo motel # 14 . this book was so interesting and mesmerizing - i read it non-stop for 2 days ... ..all 399 pages of it . i could not put it down - i even drug it to work with me today . there are some nice photographs in there , but i would like to see about 1000 more of the life and times of alan shepard . some people are born to live lives of extreme risk , challenge and unbelievable success ... ..and the rest of us can only imagine what it must have felt like to be in their shoes . shepard 's life was very exciting indeed , and i wonder why on earth did it take 43 years for this wonderful book to be published ? the truth may be a painful and bitter thing to taste , but it 's the way things panned out in real life . they had a huge ego and they stroked that ego one times too many . why do risk takers take so many risks ? well , i suppose it comes with the territory of being a risk taker in the first place . today -- -all of our famous apollo astronaughts are aging ; many have passed on to the big rocket ship in the sky , so reading about these incredible men and the incredible lives they lived is a real treat for all persons who wonder about such immense challenges . it is my sincere hope that all of them have books published about their biographies ... they have lived and dared to fulfill outrageous dreams . they are what make this country great in the eyes of the universe . before long , the apollo moon walkers will be gone from the face of this beautiful blue earth . we need to know them - at least by biographies - we need to hear thier stories and understand their feelings before their ultimate count-down to zero is counted . please read this book ! it 's an excellent book ! it 's the year 2004 and i can now say i know alot more about this man that held the facination of millions ... ..alan shepard - he was a great man who did great things , and lived life to the fullest possible
