a lesson in with holding judgement four years ago i was completely smitten with noll 's jung cult and the many facinating threads to follow from the book 's many descriptions of cults , personages and movements at the time of the fin de siecle . i thought noll truly brilliant . this past year i followed one of those threads from noll to sonu shamdasani 's cult fiction . reading the two led me to a lesson in scholarly research and withholding judgement . i could have founded a noll cult after reading his writing . i learned to question it more objectively reading shamdasani . the two do a great tango and i have found it of essence to read them both . i do n't know and find it ridiculous to say they hate each other -- hey they sell each others ' books and i am a different thinker and jung adept after reading both authors . noll is rich with references and associations -- sonu questions very thoroughly and almost without flaw noll 's argument . shamdasani does grip noll 's hamstring but the joy of reading the jung cult for me is n't flagged -- only changed in the sense of i am glad i got past noll to read sonu
