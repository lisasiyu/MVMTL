what book are you reading ? apparently the reviewer from pw read a different book from the one lisa rogak wrote ... . her book on atkins was funny , juicy , informative ... and really a tribute to the man who was so ahead of his time . i loved the different faces of atkins revealed , the surprising and sometimes a little shocking facets of the man 's personality . also , revealing the fact that atkins was a proponent of alternative medicine left me wanting to know more . atkins was a risk taker , a man who dared to be different . rogak gives us all the personal tidbits that existed behind the public persona who was that man . i love the diet ... and i love rogak 's book !
