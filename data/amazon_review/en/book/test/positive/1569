is there a cosmic blueprint ? this ( 2004 edition ) is an updated re-publication of davies ' 1988 book . in the new preface , davies ( mathematical physicist , prolific writer , recipient of the faraday prize , the kelvin medal , and the templeton prize ) suggests the possibility of something quite outlandish -- that if humanity can somehow survive the full future of the universe , that upon the universe 's thermodynamic and quantum demise , our descendants might scramble into a new universe of their own manufacture . the assertion brings several thoughts to mind , we might begin with , well , let 's say , idea-heisting [ i 'll not say plagiar_sm , that would be a bit harsh ] . ( frank tipler famously envisioned this kind of scenario in a universe headed for a `` big crunch . '' the big crunch has currently fallen out of favor with astronomers and theorists , and davies ' invented universe envisions the currently favored thermodynamic `` big fade away '' scenario . ) it also might strike us as unrealistic or even arrogant ; but , foolish or not , davies ' reason for such 'optimism ' is unveiled in the following 200 pages . what follows is a fast-paced and critical tour-de-force of the state of current and emerging scientific theories and prospects ( promising and otherwise ) for the future . there are many outstanding discussions , one centered on the mathematics of self-similar scaling -- the `` mandelbrot set '' being a famous example . davies believes that , in principle , science will one day explain , comprehensively , how the world works . do n't hold your breath , we 're not exactly close to that day just yet . in some significant areas , notably the deepest theoretical understandings of biological and mind sciences , there seems to have been rather little progress at all . from popular treatments [ like glossy spreads in national geographic magazine , or discovery channel shows ] , one might be led to believe that great insights have been gained into how biological evolution proceeds and how life arises spontaneously from non-life . davies surveys the competing claims and theories in these disciplines and exposes them as being starkly impotent to date . ( there is a popular myth that only religious fundamentalists are skeptical of the neo-darwinian story line -- but many of the most penetrating minds of modern theoretical science and mathematics , including werner heisenberg , niels bohr , john von neumann , and kurt godel , among others , have found the darwinian story to be non-compelling at best , and on some points glaringly wrong . as davies points out , a world in which 'natural selection ' was the great generative engine , supporting only reproductive advantages , many life forms that we observe , like elephants [ low birth rate , long gestation period , etc ] , could not have been 'selected ' into existence . it does no good to protest that elephants should not and could not reproduce like bunnies -- in a truly darwinian world there simply should not be elephants [ or humans : striving to discern whether the universe might be headed toward a 'big crunch ' or a 'heat death ' can offer no reproductive advantage for beings given to contemplating such things ! ] . one thinks of many darwin-confuters in the plant kingdom . a world built by darwinian mechanisms would be populated only by masters of mitosis , and perhaps sex-maniacs that mated like bunnies , although sex itself , a comparatively inefficient means of reproduction [ obviously when compared to mitotic reproduction ] , is another intractable problem for the darwinian story . ) davies , like many noted physicists , is well studied and articulate in theoretical biology , and finds the state of neo-darwinian evolutionary theory to be mostly a patched-up , just-so story that is easy fodder for skepticism . he does , however , believe that stuart kaufmann 's ideas concerning holistic approaches to understanding complexity may be more fruitful . however i give a wrong impression if i seem to suggest that the book is largely about biological evolution , it is not . this is but one of several illuminating discussions , most of which understandably center on mathematical physics . davies , an epistemological optimist at any rate , expects that theoretical biology and mind science will one day succumb to our advancing knowledge , and that we will know , exhaustively , how the world works . but to know how the world works is not to know why the world works . even if science should attain a reductionistic `` theory of everything '' and a stunning cadre of holistic theories explaining all features of 'emergence ' and 'complexity ' , the big why question ( s ) will remain , and any answers will remain as matters of faith , not strict science . science speaks to `` how , '' but why should this be so ? why should there be an explainable world and why should it contain world-explainers ? one can deny teleological inference and many materialists insist [ religiously ] on doing so , but the denial is one of personal choice , not actual science . the world is 'up to something , ' and this fact is fundamentally written into the new physics . the mysterious profundity of `` why '' always remains . in the day that davies foresees , when physical science has achieved its final triumph , it will not have dispensed with god and it will not have written purpose out of the world . well , that 's the book in a nutshell , but there 's much more to it . i 've read something like ten of davies ' books ; most of them being either 'good ' or 'very good ' ( with one notable exception ) and this volume fits either category , except , perhaps , for that wild assertion in the new preface
