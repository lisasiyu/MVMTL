absolutely superb work - a must have for eastern front buffs ! this book is of the highest quality , from its hard cover , to its glossy pages , to the photographs and historical records . this is the most detailed account of urban warfare in stalingrad i have ever read . the book is fast-paced , easy to follow , thoroughly researched , and extremely informative . i could not put this book down and learned more about the streetfighting in stalingrad than from all the other books i have read combined . if you want to learn about the horrific fighting in stalingrad from a first-person perspective , this is the highest quality work i have encountered . i recommend it to anyone with an interest on the subject and can assure you that you will not be disappointed . a first class historical work all the way . impressive ! ( on a side note , i specifically looked for the author emphasizing that he was only doing his job and only found one reference . so , i have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer who stated that this was a repeat issue .
