vsm for the office i found this to be a good book on translating the tools of manufacturing to an office environment . it communicates all of the basics that are required . i 've attended one of this consulting group 's manufacturing classes . i found them to be dead on . i like the way they handled the accounting/cost/metric relationship to lean production . basically , the current accounting standards will cause you to do things in opposition to what lean principles will have you do . in some other office scenarios , i think this more traditional approach will not have all the pieces or tools required . i work in an industry where order entry is significantly more complex than the examples presented , a much higher degree of interaction with other players is required , and rework loops are significant part of the process ( customer driven rework ) . anitech has an approach that tracks the information flow surrounding the work process , while applying the same lean techniques that are presented in this book . tracking the information flow provides an opportunity to sort out , automate , and lean out that information flow . there is tremendous leverage in this concept
