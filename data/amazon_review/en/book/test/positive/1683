a peak at the past ... and present what a treat to have this updated version of the author 's classic history of boston . the photos still resonate with the sadness of their loss and the beauty of their existence . but this is n't just a coffee table book . it remains the best history of this fascinating old , and new , city . i especially liked the supplement telling what had been saved , what was threatened and what was lost . i bought the first version 20 years ago and have bought the second to give to the next generation in my household to say how cities grow and should grow . a splendid book
