the conservative mind : from burke to eliot this was by far the most informational book i have ever read on conservatism . i learned more about the history both the good and bad about conservatism . also this book is very practicle and worthwhile . no hype just fact and purpose . anybody who is a conservative should read this book so as to know the rich history we have and the future direction we are taking . to those who are not conservative or dont know if they are conservative please read this book . it is a book that should not be taken lightly . the very history and future direction of conservatism lies within its covers . a must have in every library . it is in mine
