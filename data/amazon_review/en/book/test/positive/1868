the crown jewel of japanese literature i first read snow country more than 20 years ago and it has haunted me ever since . periodically i have to re-read it to see how age has affected my understanding . like most of kawabata 's work snow country is a love story emphasizing , in restrained evocations , the evanescence of life and happiness . shimamura , the central character of snow country , is a tokyo dilittante who breaks his ennui through his liaison with komako , a geisha and denizen of the hill country near niigata . but his search for relief from his moral tedium succombs to his inability to have anything but aesthetic appreciation ; he senses but he does not seem to feel . it is komako 's hopelessness amidst her instinctive love for shimamura that makes this story so compelling . shimamura 's ironic detachment from life , evident in his wholly aesthetic perspectives on everything ranging from western ballet ( something of which though he has never viewed he has exhaustive knowledge ) to pastoral vistas and the methodical attentions of a hotspring geisha , prevents him from feeling the love komako throws at him . komako herself is confined to what the japanese call the mizushobai , or the `` floating existence . '' this `` water-like '' life of women who earn their living through paid companionship in bars and resorts gives them a certain degree of freedom but can also resign them to loneliness and most often does . while shimamura is attracted to komako , her status combined with his aesthetic perspective of her as a woman of the mizushobai dooms the affair as he takes to admiring a younger geisha called yoko . it took kawabata nearly 13 years to craft this story into its final form . that long attention to writing the novel pays huge dividends . snow country is certainly one of the masterpieces of japanese literature , and it is the story that won yasunari kawabata the nobel prize
