a great explanation of religion from several disciplines this was used as the primary textbook for my senior seminar as a religion major in college . pals provides a great introduction to the major theories of religion , which we then used to help us understand the primary writings of freud , eliade , marx , durkheim , geertz and others . in the years since taking the class , this is one of the few books that i have recommended to a number of friends along the way who have been interested in learning more about religion from a philosophical/academic standpoint
