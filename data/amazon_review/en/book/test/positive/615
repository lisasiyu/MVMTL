war and peace i got strange looks when people spotted me reading war and peace . not many 14 year olds took on the challenge . yet i did , and enjoyed myself immensely . if you read it in a public place , you 'll most likely get funny looks for reading the very complicated unabridged book . and i can assure you that you will most likely enjoy yourself almost as much as i did . `` war and peace '' tells of many different characters , goes through their lives , and describes the very complicated connections they all have with each other . it is a huge book , and for the first two hundred pages , one ca n't even tell someone what the book is `` about '' , because it 's not quite clear . but then it does become clear , and it all starts making wonderful sense . you ca n't help but fall in love with some of the characters and the way they act , because they 're such special characters , and it feels as though you truly know them . despite its length , this book is totally worth it ; worth the time , the effort , the headaches , the angry mutterings about things not going your way ... it 's worth everything .
