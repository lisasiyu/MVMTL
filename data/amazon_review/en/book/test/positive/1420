lee does it again ! this book compiles about 23 issues of spidey 's earlier adventures , going through many important chapters . it does n't seem to give quite as much satisfaction as the first three volumes , perhaps because most spidey fans have seen reprints of some of the issues contained in this volume . if you 're new to spidey , snag this ... if you 're not new , still get it to fill in your blanks = )
