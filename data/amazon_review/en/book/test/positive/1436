roanoke island colony of freedmen even though i am a self-taught researcher of local and nc history and genealogies , i had not heard of this publication until i saw the author on pbs tv . i ordered the book from ... and am still in the process of reading it . it seems well documented and contains information i was not aware of until i read this book . i have helped two different african-american individuals research their families and so this subject was of interest to me . i recently was in court as a juror and was approached by a bystander who heard me describe my & quot ; line of work. & quot ; i told her of this book and how she could obtain a copy . she said she would like to add this publication to her personal library of publications on black research . i purchased this book for our local historical/genealogical library so that it could be used by everyone doing black research . i ony live about 60 miles as the crow flies from roanoke island and had never heard of this freedmen 's colony until now
