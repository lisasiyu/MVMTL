a good story , told stephen ambrose 's book tells the story of d company , 6th para . and the taking of the bridges over the orne canal and river . it is an excellent , if skimpy , telling of one of the facinating stories of wwii . i have always found the incident interesting since seeing it portrayed in & quot ; the longest day & quot ; it is a quick read , and i 'd have liked more detail , but it is a good book none the less
