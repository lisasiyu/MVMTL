read reviews carefully amazon has not done a good job sorting out the various editions and translations of marcus aurelius ' meditations . as a result , comments with many stars actually may be referring to an entirely different translation . likewise , hardbound references do n't match up with the paperback versions . i 'd recommend that you find a copy somewhere and look at the text yourself before you order .
