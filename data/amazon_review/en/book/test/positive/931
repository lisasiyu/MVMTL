balance and common sense . i finally found a book to recommend to people of my era who `` induldged '' once upon a time and now have kids of their own . responsible drug use can be no more traumatic than wine at dinner or the daily dose of caffine . it is n't about the drug it is about the way it is used and under what circumstances . teach children the facts and show them responsible conduct and they are likely to respond accordingly . however , sullum did not write this book to condone the use of drugs . he wrote a book that instead argues to the logical conclusion that humans have always used drugs and they are likely to keep right on doing so . this book takes the wind out of the argument that drug use is somehow morally wrong . in fact he is pretty convincing when he claims that drug use is normal and to adopt a `` zero tolerance '' position towards drugs is impossible to do without creating high crime and coruption as a side effect . it is morally wrong to attempt to regulate moral behavior in a free society . it is acknowledged in the writing that `` some '' people have trouble with drugs but the majority of users do not . spending hugh amounts of public money to stop drug use in a free society does not make any sense but sullum makes it clear to the reader that making sense has never been the point in the war on drugs . this really rung a bell with me because it appeals to my common sense and personal experience.my use of drugs in my younger days did not stop me from being honorably discharged from the military , getting a college degree or becomming a professional technician . i find that i am one of the many middle aged people who smoked some pot and still became reponsible adults . i also stopped , including cigarettes , when it no longer suited me . just as sullum points out that the overwhelming majority of us do . so ... i would highly recommend this book to you if you are questioning the rationality behind the war on drugs . it is not going to convince you that you should be doing drugs and that is not the pont of the work . this study will give you many well argued points that demonstrate how the effort to stop drug use through draconian drug laws is not working and worse , doing more damage to society overall than the drugs themselves are causing . an example of this is tobacco . the author wrote a grate deal on this point . this is one of the most widely used and harmful of all the drugs in our society . through education and a publily funded add campain the used of tobacco has dropped dramatically over the past 30 years without draconian enforcement . just the opposite has happened with marijuanna where the laws are becomming more and more draconian every year , the cost of enforcement is mind boggling and the easiest place to score a bag of pot is right down at the local high school . it is a strange , sad situation to tolerate .
