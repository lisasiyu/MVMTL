london from 1660-1670 i stumbled on liza picard 's books quite by chance . after looking at the publishing date in some of the books it is apparent some of them have been around for several years . i am now recommending them to anyone and everyone and i am so glad i stumbled across the first one i read on a rainy afternoon , lonely and far away from home . i have now read them all . as soon as you start to read the book it becomes apparent that the author is passionate about her subject and wants the reader to enjoy the reading experience as much as she has in the writing of it . liza picard presents an enthralling picture of how life in london was really lived in the 1600s : the houses and streets , gardens and parks , cooking , clothes and jewellery , cosmetics , hairdressing , housework , laundry and shopping , medicine and dentistry , sex , education , hobbies , etiquette , law and crime , religion and popular beliefs . to anyone who has not read the author 's books perhaps these subjects seem boring and mundane , but they are written about with such knowledge and wit that they literally come to life in the readers imagination . liza picard was born in 1927 . she read law and qualified as a barrister but did not practice . quite where she gleaned all this information from i am not sure . that it was a labour of love is obvious to anyone who reads her books and i for one am grateful
