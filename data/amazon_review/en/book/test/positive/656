packed with knowledge ! economist joseph a. schumpeter 's keen intellect makes some of today 's scholarship sound like the spouting of ideology on talk shows . some consider him the greatest economist of the twentieth century . only an intellect of his towering stature would be able to present a case that while marx was wrong about how capitalism would collapse , he was probably correct that it eventually would . schumpeter also contends that socialism may eclipse free-market economies , news he feels society should greet with angst . he believed that capitalism 's doom would proceed not from a revolution by an angry proletariat , but rather as a result of successes that would give rise to a class of elites who would gradually institute systems of central control . fully understanding this complex , although non-mathematical , treatise may require some background ; it is not a book for the novice . while this 1942 classic may seem dated in spots , those who conclude that it is time to tap dance on socialism 's grave should consider that schumpeter expected socialism 's dominance to take a century or more . we recommend this classic to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the historic , economic case for the rise of socialism
