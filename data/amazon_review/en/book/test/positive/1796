beauty is an attitude a book on style that starts from the inside -- yes , please ! it 's great to feel good in your clothes , but that 's frosting on the cake . to feel beautiful inside and out takes so much more than a great scarf or well-cut jacket ( fabulous as those are ! ) , and this book is one of the very few that truly recognizes that . it 's a shame that some people spend a huge amount of time and money on trying to perfect their outer image without realizing that there are people who feel ( and are ! ) beautiful in thrift-store clothes and there are people wearing clothes from vogue and w who feel flawed and ugly . this book goes much deeper than many books on style , and for that reason it 's a fantastic addition to the books that focus only on fashion tips
