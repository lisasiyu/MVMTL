truly a classic ! ! ! ! this is a must buy book ! ! ! a classic in every sense of the word . ms. mitford did a wonderful job when the work was originally published and the `` revisited '' portions are great too . as a casket distributor , i have a fairly unique perspective on the funeral business . funeral directors provide a very necessary service to society and are worthy of our praise for their work . that being said , some of their practices are manipulative at best . for example , i sell caskets directly to the public , and even though it is a consumers right to purchase this item directly from an independent casket retailer , funeral homes try their best to steer consumers toward their own highly marked up products . ms. mitford breaks the whole process down in an informative and entertaining manner . i think you will enjoy her work . my website www.sacredvessel.com has some great consumer protection related information if you are looking for additional resources . best wishes for your journey
