what you do n't know is hurting you although most of modern day america will not want to hear the research this book relates , it is fascinating - a little infuriating , and very interesting . the facts and information presented on our health care system and mostly about our standard american diet have led me to a complete diet change - and i feel great now ! i also know i 'm doing what is best for my body . the book is easy to read and understandable even with the research statistics . i would encourage anyone who is interested in their health to read this , but be warned - you may not like what you learn .
