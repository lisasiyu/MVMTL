great insight into what i thought was `` good for me '' although my trips to fast-food joints have only been reduced ( not eliminated ) , i 've found myself referring to fast-food beverages as `` drinking corn '' ... .you 'll need to read the book to find out why . i recommend this book if you 're at all curious about the food you eat . it was great that the auther was able to give both sides of the story for each of the 4 meals and i 've certainly been taking a closer look at where my food comes from
