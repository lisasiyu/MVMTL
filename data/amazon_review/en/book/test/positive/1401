great buy i am not a builder but i am planning to build green.i wanted to be as informed as possible , so i could research the building requirments , communicate as intelligently as possible , hire the right people , choose the right architect , etc . this book gave me 98 % of all the info i needed on a graywater system , even though i 'm building in pennsylvania and author is a californian . i have `` create an oasis with graywater '' also . these books have made my life much simplier .
