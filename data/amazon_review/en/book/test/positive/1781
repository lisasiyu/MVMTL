thorough account of the politics and policy behind the war robert mann , a former congressional aide , fails to disappoint in his comprehensive political history of the nation 's longest war . mann focuses on the politics and policy that led to the worst military defeat in american history . for the most part , `` a grand delusion '' turns its gaze away from the action on the ground in indochina , examining instead the decisions that policymakers in washington faced during the war , the political pressures brought to bear on them , and the choices that they made over the course of twenty-five years . mann finds the roots of american involvement in the bitter political debates that erupted following the `` loss '' of china and north korea 's invasion of its southern neighbor , as president truman suffered mortal political damage from his apparent inability to stem the communist tide in asia . from those disasters , american policymakers took the first of several dangerous delusions : no politician could survive if he allowed an asian country to fall to a communist government . as the situation in south vietnam deteriorated in the face of a virulent and effective communist insurgency , us government officials stirred more `` delusions '' into the policymaking mix : after the debacle at munich in 1938 , the west must always use force against its enemies , regardless of the nature of the threat or the national interests implicated ; the vietcong guerillas were communists first and nationalists second , with their foremost goal the spread of global communism and not national independence from the french ; the unification of vietnam under communist leadership would threaten other american allies in southeast asia ; america 's national security depended on the success of the south vietnamese government ; and south vietnam was ultimately capable of mustering the will , the political reforms , and military capability to defend itself , provided that the us stood by it until it could do so . each of these assumptions , according to mann , was disastrously wrong . mann charts how these assumptions , like the progression of a fatal illness , infected every step of the policymaking process , leading five presidents to escalate america 's involvement . mann guides the reader through the internal debates that led policymakers down this dangerous path , showing how officials from both parties clung to these false assumptions and how these delusions informed their decisions . mann pays special attention to the relationship between the white house and the senate , the branch of congress that the founders expected to have more of a role in foreign affairs because of its longer terms and power over appointments and treaties . perhaps the most tragic figure in this book is senator mike mansfield , the majority leader through much of the war , who suppressed his doubts about the war out of political loyalty to the president and the sense that the senate must not undermine the commander in chief in a time of war . indeed , much of the book is a story of how congress threw aside its constitutional responsibilities to declare war and provide oversight to the executive 's foreign policy , and how it slowly reclaimed those powers . the book has a few defects . the book contains far too many spelling and grammatical errors . also , at times , the narrative bogs down in bureaucratic minutiae , leaving some passages as interesting as a typical inter-office memo . still , the book is a noteworthy addition to the literature of the vietnam war by reminding us how it came about and why . if anything , it has only become more relevant since it was first published : readers will find haunting parallels , for instance , between vietnamization and `` as iraqis stand up , we will stand down .
