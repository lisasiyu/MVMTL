defender of self government thomas paine 's & quot ; rights of man & quot ; is truly a classic defense of self government and reprsentative republicanism . paine copmletely demolishes edmund burke 's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions . paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it 's own people through high taxes , unjust property laws , and priveleges for the nobility . paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form . he denounces aristocracy and monarchy as & quot ; frauds & quot ; and based upon tyranny . the first review by will murphy critsizing paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark . paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state . it must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch , living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle , lower and working classes . paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion , speech , and ideas.to imply paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical . paine was not an enemy of property , just an enemy of aristocracy , who in his day did not obtain property by hard work . usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful , and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace . paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by god to rule . if you love freedom , you ca n't go wrong with the & quot ; rights of man & quot ;
