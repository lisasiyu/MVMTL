a good book but like most heinlein 's books to surmise , the book is about an actor who is hired to be a political figure . i will not reveal any more as to not ruin the nature of the plot . i felt that like some of heinlein 's books , the book is plauged with politics , less science fiction , the only sci-fi thing about it is that the plot takes place in space , other than that , it 's all politics . same thing with citizen of the galaxy , a book that starts off really well and ending with a theme that do not portray sci-fi rather it shows heinlein 's knowledge in law . i felt that the book could have been much better and i do n't see how it won the hugo award . conclusion : the book is a fun pass , but nothing more . do n't expect any groundbreaking plot , or jaw dropping plot twists , just your old fashioned politicians-dear-diary
