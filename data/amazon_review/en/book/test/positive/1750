well written hot topic . i found this book well written and deals with key issues that are importnat in todays world such as immigration , nationalism , democrasy and terrorism . the book is divided into 4 parts . each of these parts include issues that examine nationalism , immigration , governments and racism . also anti-immigrant sentiments , the `` war on terror , '' muslim and jewish semitism as well as importnat issues of power . i found a section particularly interesting dedicated to helping people understand where trouble and violence may erupt in volatile areas . due to rifaats personal experience with turbulence and war , he became alerted to several factors which lead him to predict where aggressive nationalism may occur . he formalized a model to help foresee where trouble and violence might erupt . he states this modle proved useful over the years , as he prevented a multinational corporation from putting its head office in beirut a few years before civil war broke out . he read the signes indication the possibility of violence on a large scale . the four factors which rifaat formulated to reliably indicate a probable outbreak of violence is the instinctive nature of group formation coupled with fanning the falmes of nationalism , the lack of human inhibition for killing and the power leaders possess . the book offers an interesting , exciting and sometimes humorous view into world politics , racial profiling , terrorism and above all , lessons in human nature . if you want a witty insight into these issues get this book .
