good ideas ... . the cookbook does the best it can considering the subject ! what foodie wants to give up food ? not that one is giving up food per se . maybe trying one recipe per week and gradually replacing high fat foods instead of going it cold turkey would work . there 's nothing wrong with the recipes i 've tried . i 'd just rather be eating foods i need to let go of
