very good edition as you would expect from oxford , this is a very well done edition of the play , with a comprehensive introduction ( though i wished for a little more theatre history myself ) that covers the major issues in this `` problem '' comedy ( though it is not nearly so much a problem play as , say , troilus and cressida , in fact being much closer in many ways to measure for measure ) , several textual appendices , an index , useful textual- and foot-notes ( there seem to be a great many phrasings in this play that need explanation -- a result of revision ? ) , and two of shakespeare 's direct sources in erasmus and painter . there were a few points when i disagreed with the interpreations offered in the footnotes , but overall , the apparatus is excellent . as for the play itself , the main action concerns the efforts of helen to recapture her husband bertram , who is given to her by the king as a reward for curing his fistula . he does not think she , as a physician 's daughter , is worthy of his station and flees to the wars in italy without consumating the marriage . the comic subplot involves the exposure of the cowardice of his companion , paroles . helen evnetually fulfills the requirements bertram sets out in a letter -- to obtain his ring and bear a child by him -- through a bed trick , and the play ends where it began , with the king ( echoes of lear ? ) offering diana , who helped in the trick , her choice of husband . overall , a very good edition of a less popular play .
