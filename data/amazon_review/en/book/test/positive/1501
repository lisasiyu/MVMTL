a wonderful reference i really enjoy using this book . my 29 year old gelding has found new vigor from the suggested herbs , and my son 's 2 year old mare is in peak condition thanks to black oil sunflower seeds and other recommendations . i recommend this book to anyone with horses who 's interested in helping them to stay happy and healthy into old age
