incredible book i purchased this book to find out about the publishing industry and more effectively market my book . without mr. kremer 's book i would have been clueless , however now i am well informed and continue to sell my book . it has been picked up for a second edition by another publisher , which was my main goal . ( i self published as a quick way to get review copies out to the public and get the book rolling ) i knew the world needed my book and i needed it releasedquick . mission accomplished . i keep 001 ways close to my side and continuously consult it as i continue my publishing journey . highly recommended to anyone who wants to sell books and be successful and effective in the process
