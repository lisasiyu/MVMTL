some love it , some hate it ... i love it ! i read this in high school and could certainly relate to holden at the time . he 's an angry , rebellious , sarcastic teen with a serious attitude problem . throughout the story , he grows , he learns and he faces some really horrible things in his past . the story is 'badly ' written to some standards but in an artistic way which reflects the character . there are a lot of intense situations and some profanity ( as a teen i was like `` cool ! '' hehe ) . in the beginning , holden seems to hate te world . you start out hating holden and thinking he is a jerk but through the course of the story you learn so much about him and you share his pain . you learn that benieth a tough mask , lies a smart , sensitive and thoughtful person . it 's a flawed story , with a flawed character in a flawed world but it all seems so real that you feel like you are there . it has a lot of dry , sarcasic humor which had me laughing out loud in class . mostly it 's a story about growing up and the journey of a young man discovering who he really is in a world full of phony people . i can see why this is a classic ! a warning though to those who are sensitive or easily offended : there are some sad parts and lots of foul language but without this it would not be the same story ! it 's a timeless story and i would certainly read this book again
