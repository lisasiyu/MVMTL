good , in a classic sort of way this book is not for everyone . if you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that ( such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today ) , then you should stay away . for lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature , this is a good book . a lot of things are amazing , considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time . some of it just boggles my mind . at the same time , the book is long winded and in the end , not quite as much happens as one would expect . dan brown 's davinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than verne has in his entire book . but that is ok in a way , because when i read a classic , i do not expect to compare it to modern standards . the entertainment is due to different factors . in fact , the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story . i do not give this book 5 stars however , because i was disappointed in the end , since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion . i do not want to spoil the book for you , but there are a lot of unanswered questions , and getting those answers really was what kept me reading . there is quite a bit of build-up , and then in some ways , the book just ends . ( i noticed that style in many books of that time , where the narrator just says `` here is what i know ... but i do not know the whole story ... '' ) . also , to some extent , i agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score , in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story . i do not complain about some of it being like a log book , but i would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board . i just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room . they must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat . or at least attempted it , and that would have been interesting to read about , without breaking with the overall style of the book
