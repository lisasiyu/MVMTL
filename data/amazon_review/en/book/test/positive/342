fit to read over and over as a card-carrying guy , and card-carrying dave barry nut , this book is just plain dynamite . it captures how us guys behave beautifully -- no , we do n't behave beautifully , but it captures the primitive nature of how we behave before , and sometimes during , marriage . since reading this book , when my wife wants an opinion about almost anything related to her , i say , `` i have no opinion about that -- i 'm a guy ! what do you expect ? '' she already knew this , but having the book to go by re-enforces it . great bit about how barry survived hurricane andrew , which scared the daylights out of anybody , like me , anywhere near andrew 's path . great bits about exploding vacuums and a group called the `` lawn rangers , '' either of which , if i read them wile drinking coffee , would put my life in peril . a dandy little book
