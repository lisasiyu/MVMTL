binding concerns i hesitated ordering this book because a previous reviewer reported that he had found the binding to be inferior . perhaps this was true in previous bindings , but the copy i recently obtained looks fine in this regard and should stand up to heavy use for some years to come . i 'm finding this an excellent disctionary in all regards , though as a beginner i have not put it to lots of use . basically i use the new nelson , with this dictionary as a supplement , especially for compounds . and there are times when this alternate system of radical identification is just easier than the traditional system .
