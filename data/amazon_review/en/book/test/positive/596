very enjoyable and likeable characters everyone is comparing this follow up novel to `` the three junes '' when a novel is as perfect as that , the follow up is rarely as good . however , i enjoyed this book a great deal . the characters were genuine and very likable . i found it easy to relate to their stories , dilemmas and decisions . i would definitely recommend it
