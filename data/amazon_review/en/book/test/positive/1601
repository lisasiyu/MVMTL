an excellent read - my kids begged to do history ! we read this book as a part of our homeschool history curriculum this year . it was very informative and entertaining . my children ( ages 6 and 8 ) absolutely loved it . we have the older version , and my kids did n't even mind the lack of color and the sparse illustrations . they begged me , '' one more chapter ... please , mom ? ! '' i would say the only thing i did not care for in this book was the way they portray the indians . other than squanto , samoset and massasoit , all of the other indians are viewed as 'savages ' ( and not very intelligent ones , at that . ) in the last few chapters , they are even used as 'comic relief . ' she also has them speaking the word 'ugh ' a lot ... such as `` ugh ! white squaw bring me cider ! '' i thought that was a little unrealistic , and insulting as well . the information on the pilgrims is wonderful , and she really brought their journey alive . if you can overlook the indian parts , i would highly recommend this book .
