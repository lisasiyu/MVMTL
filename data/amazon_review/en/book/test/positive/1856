respect ! that 's what this books about ... alt ed is a very interesting book . it talks about all the stereotypes that teenagers have to put up with in high school . it shows how rude people can be to others . i liked how the kids had to get involved in the group . the group helped the kids open up to each other and to say what needed to be said . without the group i think a lot of the kids would have gotten into even more trouble then they were in . this book is great if you want to teach others about respect and stereotypes
