fascinating this is an excellent book . i have had the grace to see first hand two of the incorruptibles whose stories are detailed here by joan carrol cruz ( saint catherine laboure and st. bernadette soubirous ) , and not even this wonderful book can prepare you for the experience . while her research is sound , even first rate , cruz has an easy to read prose that does not descend to the dry and academic . although cruz 's style is reverent , at times even bordering on devotional , this is an excellent book for catholic and non-catholic alike , skeptic and believer
