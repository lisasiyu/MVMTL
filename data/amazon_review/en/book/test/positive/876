to clear some things up on the issue of the author ... the original text was written by captain charles johnson in 1724 . in 1932 , john robert moore announced that the real author was daniel defoe . he was so certain that he wrote a book about it ( defoe in the pillory and other studies ) . he was so convincing that most libraries/ publishers changed the cataloging . however , in 1988 , p. n. furbank and w. r. owens proved him wrong , also in book form ( the canonisation of daniel defoe ) , based on the fact that there was n't a single piece of documentary evidence that defoe wrote the book . long story short , johnson wrote the book , not defoe
