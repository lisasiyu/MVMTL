an excellent resource for an excellent tool ! so , what happens is , you 're playin ' with a bunch of nashville dudes , see ? they 're cuttin ' this song , and the big-shot says , & quot ; progression is 1 , 4 , 5 ... the chorus goes : 4 , 5 , 6minor - three times ; fourth time , it goes 4 , 5 , 1. & quot ; what do you do ? you go , & quot ; what key is it in ? & quot ; 'course , you should be able to figure that out by a quick listen , and a tap or two on your guitar ... but even if you do n't , someone 's bound to think you 're just lazy , and blurt out , & quot ; it 's in g , man ! & quot ; so , okay ... big deal . you can count ! you know the song goes g , c , d ... exept in the chorus , which goes c , d , em - three times , and then c , d , g the fourth time . the cool thing about it , is when the vocalist arrives and he/she ca n't sing in the key of g ! ... it has to be in the key of d ! nothing changes . the progression is still 1 , 4 , 5 , etc . -- only now you 're starting from d as # 1 and counting . so , now we 're gon na play d , g , a ... and the chorus goes g , a , bm - three times ; fourth time is g , a , d. pretty simple , huh ? everybody can do their private math , quietly , and , in ten minutes when the tape starts to roll , everybody sounds like they knew what was up all the time . the vocalist is very impressed ! and , most of all , the guy cutting the checks is smiling
