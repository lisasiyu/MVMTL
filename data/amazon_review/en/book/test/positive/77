very enjoyable i love doris kearns goodwin 's work , and this book is no exception . it 's very different from her other books , but very enjoyable . it brought me back to my childhood while reading about hers . very short in comparison to her other books , but worth the time and the money . i have heard complaints that she got some of the baseball facts wrong , but i am not a baseball historian , so this did n't bother me in the least bit .
