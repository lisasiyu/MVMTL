doss writes another winner in his shaman series another in james d. doss ' shaman series which began with the shaman sings in the mid 1990s . the series started off good and just keeps getting better . doss marries a wry writing style with well-drawn characters , a clever story line and a fine understated humour . his setting is southern colorado , a land of ranchers , wide spaces and capable country people both matukach ( white ) and ute native americans . the shaman of the series , wise old ute daisy perika , does n't feature to the extent that she has in other books in the series but her contribution via dreams and premonitions is subtle and true . her character is the stuff the series is built on . she is abrasive and annoying , and takes pleasure in being so , yet the writer has made her irascible while likeable and she is the character the reader will remember long after the rest are forgotten . the story 's central character is charlie moon , nephew of daisy perika and a ute rancher and sometime policeman for his tribe . charlie 's major trouble in life is a mountain cat terrorising his ranch workers and cattle , until he is asked to find out who injured a u.s . senator and at the same time killed billy smoke , the senator 's driver . the senator , who runs the neighbouring ranch , has his own agenda and charlie finds himself also involved in investigating a leak of damaging government information from the senator 's ranch . charlie finds himself often on the tricky side of guns and dangerous animals ( both human and not ) . it makes for a rollicking and thoroughly enjoyable read . no sex but some violence
