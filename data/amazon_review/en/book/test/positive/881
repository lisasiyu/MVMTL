`` there is all i ever loved ! '' these heartbreaking words are spoken by quasimodo near the very end of this novel but they could just as easily have been uttered by any number of the characters in this magnificent and awe-inspiring story . because of an inappropriate english translation of the title of this book , not to mention the popular characterization of quasimodo , it is always assumed that the `` half-made '' and hideous-looking bell-ringer of the cathedral of notre dame is the central character of this tragedy , but he is not . his unrequited love for the beautiful la esmeralda is only one of the tragic tales told throughout this novel . the story is set in medieval paris in the year 1482 . the town has just celebrated the feast of fools with quasimodo being chosen as the reigning pope for the celebration . quasimodo is the adopted son of claude frollo , the archdeacon of notre dame cathedral . la esmeralda is an exquisitely beautiful young gypsy girl who , along with her trained goat , djali , performs throughout the streets of paris to the delight and amusement of the townspeople . dom frollo has been secretly lusting after la esmeralda and believes her to be a witch sent by satan to turn him away from his priestly vows . on the evening of the feast of fools , dom claude enlists quasimodo to help him kidnap the gypsy woman in order to do away with her and rid his life of the temptations she represents . esmeralda is rescued but the night will set into motion a tragic chain of events which will ultimately claim as its victims all three of these central characters . two other victims in this tragedy are dom frollo 's younger brother , jehan , who the archdeacon cared for from the time he was orphaned as infant but who turned out to be a great disappointment and esmeralda 's mother , perhaps the most tragic figure in the entire novel , a woman who believed for fifteen years that her daughter was dead only to be reunited with her and have her taken away again all in the space of a few minutes . this novel is filled with unbelievably vivid descriptions of the city of paris and it 's medieval inhabitants . victor hugo brings the city to life and you will feel as if you are actually walking the streets and experiencing events as they unfold . when quasimodo is tortured upon the wheel in the pillory as punishment for his participation in the attempted kidnaping of esmeralda , you will feel yourself almost a part of the jeering crowd . the scene where esmeralda literally parts the crowd to come forward and offer quasimodo a drink of water has to be one of the most profound in all of literature ! and near the end of the novel when quasimodo is frantically trying to fend off the soldiers and gypsies who are attempting to ram through the door of the cathedral and capture esmeralda , the scenes in which he throws not only boulders but bodies over the balustrade of the church are horrifyingly realistic . it is hard to capture with words all of the feelings that victor hugo evokes with his splendid writing but suffice it to say you will be deeply moved by this story . i have been a fan of the film version with charles laughton and maureen o'hara for many years but as is most always the case , the movie can not hold a candle to the book itself . this novel really defies the ratings here at amazon but as i can only give it at most five stars , i do so wholeheartedly and with great enthusiasm . the hunchback of notre dame is definitely the finest classic i have ever read ! -- b. eden
