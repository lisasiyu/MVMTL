simply the best this is without hesitation the best book on css i have ever read . furthermore this book will make me reread the other css books i have so that i may at last grasp all the techniques hidden in them behind all the mumbo jumbo ( you know when the author says `` do it that way because it 's the way it 's done '' - really meaning that 's the way he does it but never explaining why he does it ) . a must buy .
