a worthwhile addition to your beatles library as a fan of nearly 30 years , this was one of the first beatles books i ever bought , and it remains a worthwhile buy for today 's new fans . it may not be as detailed or as enlightening as the mark lewishon-type of books , but it benefits greatly from being written in the sixties - and having a firsthand access to the band . hunter davies includes many stories and insights that would simply not be available to today 's writers - because they were n't there . the chapter that describes them writing 'with a little help from my friends ' , for example , is as amusing as it is amazing . and i very much enjoyed the prologue , where davies explains the difficulties he had with queenie epstein and aunt mimi . and his meeting with pete best in the mid-sixties is as poignant a scene as you will ever get in a beatles book . it is stories like those that make the book worth buying
