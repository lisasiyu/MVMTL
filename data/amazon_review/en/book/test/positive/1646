worth the payoff at the end before i read the last 100 pages of this book , i would have given it 3 stars . woken furies suffers from a common affliction among many sci-fi series : same-samey-ness . once you 're introduced to the world , the technologies , the aliens , whatever , unless the author can keep the creative curve balls coming ( peter hamilton often has the ability to keep things fresh ) , the joy and surprise of discovery quickly fades . and so it goes with woken furies . two thirds of the way through and i thought harlan 's world just was n't different enough from venice beach to keep me riveted . and assembling the decom team , going into battle , using the cybertech - i might as well have been re-reading broken angels , morgan 's best by far . but ! just when i was resigned my disappointment , the last few chapters cranked the book out of its nose dive . morgan lets loose with some big ideas , and the final showdown is spectacular fun . sci-fi writers often have problems ending their books ( stephenson , gibson anyone ? ) , but morgan always ends with a satisfying crunch , and this one wrapped up the nicest of them all . a word of warning - this is by far the most violent book i have ever read , and that includes morgan 's previous books . if you ca n't take the heat , stay out of the kitchen . and morgan 's graphic sex scenes seem gratuitous and perfunctory to the point of being boring porn . in morgan 's favor , as usual his prose is taut as a drum and hits hard . characterization has always been his strong point , and this is perhaps his best : kovacs 's anger seethes off every page . the self-loathing loose cannon may be a clich√© , but with kovacs you can feel it , to the point where character is basically a psychotic serial-killer , and you 're right there with him . i think morgan was wise to retire kovacs with this novel . one more and the sameyness would have made the series a bore . ( i 've given up on hamilton and reynolds for that reason - i get it already . ) if you 're a fan of the kovacs books , this is definitely worth some tedium ( albeit entertaining tedium ) to get to the payoff . i 'm looking forward to what morgan will do next
