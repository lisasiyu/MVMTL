interesting comparison between ww ii and business we certainly live in a time of change . and it seems that even the rate of change is increasing . in this fascinating book , mr. kozak-holland draws comparisons between the problems that churchill faced in assuming leadership of the british government at the start of world war ii and the modern business world . the changes in the military situation facing england were quick and sudden . the changes in the business world only slightly less so . consider , for instance , the marketplace for cameras . in a matter of very few years , the shelves at your local discount store basically no longer have film based cameras . the author discusses a technique called adaptive enterprise that churchill used in modifying the way an organization behaves in the face of change . the comparisons are very interesting to a history buff , and have direct applicability if you are manufacturing buggy whips when henry ford comes along
