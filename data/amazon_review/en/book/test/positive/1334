a must for therapists this is an excellent study of what goes on in the mind of the suicidal client . it is also a beautiful and unforgettable book . i found it touching and illuminating and it has had a profound impact on the way i treat such clients in therapy . i only thought i understood their psychological pain , but i am more accepting and empathic since reading this incredibly moving book . required reading for all therapists
