engaging text , beautiful artwork the romantic days of the search for the `` missing link '' are gone , and as science writer carl zimmer reminds us , that is all to the good since the very idea of a `` missing link '' is a misdirection . what we have today is the search for human ancestors and for a distinction to be made between our ancestors and other ancient hominids . this book with its beautiful prints and photos , engaging drawings and helpful charts , and especially the sprightly text by zimmer brings the general reader up to date ( circa 2005 ) on the latest developments . there 's a lot going on . there 's the controversy about homo floresiensis , thought to be a tiny hominid , found in indonesia in 2004. zimmer presents the arguments . some think that homo floresiensis is an island adaptation of home erectus , the first hominid to make it out of africa 1.8 million years ago . after all , island adaptation often leads to diminished size . there are fossils of now extinct small elephants in indonesia . but others believe that the skull found is an anomaly , a case of microcephaly , a birth defect . i 'm betting on the latter . there are wooden spears found that are around 400,000 years old , meaning that homo habilis or homo ergaster ( who may be one and the same ) or the more recently discovered homo heidelbergensis were accomplished tool makers long before homo sapiens arrived on the scene . there is the idea that homo neanderthalensis is a cold climate , european adaptation of homo erectus . part of the excitement in paleontology is in the new fossil finds , and part is in our new-found ability to analyze dna samples to map the spread of homo sapiens . this allows us to see the `` out of africa '' phenomenon in three main stages : ( 1 ) homo erectus leaving africa 1.8 million years ago , followed by ( 2 ) homo heidelbergensis expanding into not only europe and the near east and china , but into southeast asia as well . finally ( 3 ) , about 130,000 years ago , homo sapiens begin to move out of africa , first into the levant and then into east asia and australia ( 50,000 years ago ) , then into europe and siberia ( 40,000 years ago ) and ultimately into the americas ( 20,000 years ago ) . incidentally , this book has homo sapiens coming onto the scene almost 200,000 years ago . zimmer talks about the various hominid cultures and speculates on their social and religious possibilities . on the subject of what happened to the neanderthal , he intimates that he believes it was a combination of things that allowed humans to survive while the neanderthals went extinct , including being better able to adapt to climate change , having a more sophisticated culture and better hunting techniques . i think it 's also possible ( actually i think it 's likely ) that humans were better at killing not only herd animals but the competition as well , meaning that one of the reasons that the neanderthals are gone is because we killed them . zimmer more or less skirts around this , waiting ( wisely , i think ) until further evidence is in . in a final chapter , `` where do we go from here ? '' zimmer briefly discusses biotechnology and genetic engineering , and how our species might be affected by cultural evolution . this is a handsome book it 's like a coffee table book with the high gloss , heavy pages and the beautiful artwork , but smaller in size . most significantly it is a book aimed at the general reader that is well written , well edited , and very well presented . and it is clear . it is in fact the clearest book on human origins -- usually a very murky subject -- that i have read . by the way , zimmer is the author of several excellent science books . i especially recommend his creepy , but fascinating , parasite rex : inside the bizarre world of nature 's most dangerous creatures ( 2000 )
