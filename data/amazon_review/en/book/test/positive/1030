a very readable introduction i picked up this book to find out a bit more about this branch of christianity , and by and large i was not disappointed . this is an eminently readable introduction to anglicanism , from its founding in the 16th century to the present day . it covers all the major developments , and gives a brief background for each . it is particularly useful for anyone who wishes to put the present controversies shaking the anglican communion in a historical context , and the last chapter of the book is devoted to these controversies . the only shortcoming of the book is its overly historical and political point of view . i would have appreciated a more extensive insight into the anglican theology . overall , however , this is a wonderful little book and i highly recommend it .
