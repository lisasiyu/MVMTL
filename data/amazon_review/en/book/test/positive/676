perfect for the classroom ! i used & quot ; news reporting and writing & quot ; when i studied journalism in college . upon returning to the college classroom to teach journalism , i introduced my students to the latest edition of this wonderful text . the book provides an excellent introduction to the various elements of good journalism and is perfect for a beginning or advanced course on reporting and writing . i recommend it highly
