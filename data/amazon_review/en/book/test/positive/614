powerful this is an incredible true story of a man passionate to reach for christ those who have never heard . it also clearly illustrates the darkness , evil and despair that comes from idolatry . but it also shows the true liberation and freedom that can come only for christ . this book will draw you in from the first page . the world needs more people like stan . people who are willing to trust solely in god and how are willing to go to dangerous remote areas to share christ . this book will shatter your complaceny and force you to think . i highly recommend this book . for all christians , but especially those ( like me ) who have heart for missions . this book details the good , the bad , and the ugly of missions work .
