book content is excellent , but paper quality is worst ever i am reading the fifth edition of this book . in the earlier editions the book was published in three or four volumes . the fifth edition is a combination of all volumes . so that is good . the book is a dense read . but the content is excellent . there are 163 chapters in this book . each chapter written by different authors - experts in respective areas . so the book provides a best of breed treatment to various assorted topics . however , not all chapters are good ( but most are ) . i 'd say about 20 or so are of filler kind of chapters . nothing really special in them . but the book is worth for the rest of the matter . the chapters are also written to provoke further thought into each area . kind of `` first principles '' approach - which i like compared to the cissp guide approach of `` here is the information , now devour it for the exam '' . however this book is not an exam guide ( and i knew that before hand ) . i bought this book for the matter in it and i am very satisfied . if you are the kind of person who want to quickly assimilate and regurgitate the matter for cissp , then dont even bother . i am kind of person who loves to read things from the basics slowly , getting the concepts and ideas all clear in my mind and hence i plan to finish this book before reading cissp exam guide ( which by the way is also sitting on my bookshelf ) . however i have a major complaint againg the publishers . having charged one hundred thirty dollars for a 2000 page book , i 'd expect the quality of paper is decent . the paper is so thin , i invariably turn two pages when i am thiking it is one page . it is so thin , even turning the page carefully damages the paper . i agree that the content is specialized and most authors hold at least two or more certifications ( cissp , cisa , sscp etc . ) , but that does not warrant printing the book on really wafer thin transparent paper . sure , the publishers need to make money , but not by compromising the quality of the paper so much . and you 'd expect this kind of book to live on your shelf for a long long time than `` teach yourself crap in 24 hours '' books , but the quality of paper will make that unlikely . hence i am giving 4 stars to a book which otherwise would deserve 6 star
