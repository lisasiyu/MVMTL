a great compliment to kingston 's & quot ; the woman warrior & quot ; after reading kingston 's & quot ; the woman warrior , & quot ; i thought i 'd read & quot ; china men. & quot ; i am not disapointed at all . & quot ; china men & quot ; is an excellent biographical work that recounts the lives of chinese men in america from the 1840s to the vietnam war . although kingston uses as much chinese myth in this book as she does in & quot ; the woman warrior , & quot ; she apparently decided to keep the mythology and biography more separated . even so , kingston 's stories and the way in which she recounts them is absolutely splendid
