a balanced , loving history of devotion to mary as a convert from protestantism , i have struggled with the place of the blessed virgin mary in my personal spirituality as well as my defense of the faith . father mcbride 's images of mary has been a turning point for me . he has treated the reader as a thinking adult and as a pilgrim . his synthesis of personal devotion with the writings of the church fathers , church councils , and contemporary writers has resolved many objective and subjective dilemmas for me . i have given the book to many friends . my wife and teenage children are studying it with me . i am particularly thankful for his tender use of iconography as way of catechizing from the heart
