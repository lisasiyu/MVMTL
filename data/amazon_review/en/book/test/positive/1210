want to learn wireworking ? start with this book ! when i decided to teach myself how to work with wire ( especially wrapping cabs and other decorative work ) , i bought several books , and this one is definitely the best for learning . the illustrations are clear and easy to understand ( important for me since i 'm a visual learner ) , and the text is informative and easy to read ( though not dumbed-down ) . i 've done several of the projects so far and had no trouble ( aside from my own general lack of dexterity ) completing each of them , with attractive results . the other books just did n't work for me to get started , though i might be able to use them better now that i really understand the basics . if you already have the basic skills , you wo n't need this , but if you want to learn , start here
