one of the most entertaining books in the series so far this installment , like the rest of this series so far , is suspenseful , funny and populated with characters that seem very real . one new character , laura fielding , is admirably faithful to her imprisoned husband , and is , in general , a very likable character ( and one that charms both stephen and jack ) . the middle eastern setting of this book is exotic and very vividly described . stephen 's adventures in his new scientific marvel , the diving bell , are both funny and interesting . jack 's encounters with laura 's massive dog ponto are hilarious . the end of this book is very suspenseful because the reader has come to really care about the characters involved . the most notable thing about this book is what a great job o'brian did of keeping this series fresh by bringing in new locations , characters and situations . o'brian did a great job of not letting this series fall into predictable formulas and repetition . the only failing of this book is that the very end is just a little disappointing and o'brian leaves the reader hanging much more than in the previous books
