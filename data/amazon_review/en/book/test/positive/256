this is what a loving marriage is about although many readers have commented on elizabeth ( a truly captivating character ) , her husband isaac has been given short shift . he appears in one of the book 's most poignant scenes as he straightens up after the rosh hashana dinner and , in an act of private accounting , chastises himself for his reluctance to support his wife in her desire to open a store . analyzing his failings with the same critical eye he might bring to a scholarly text , isaac then resolves to mend his ways . this scene is almost unsurpassed in its portrayal of a tender and intensely religious jewish sensibility ( surpassed , in my reading , only by chaim grade in the closing section of the second novella in his magnificant `` rabbis and wives '' ) .
