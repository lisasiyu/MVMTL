your choice . nature 's way . two of the most powerful words in the english language . and yet we believe it is completely unnatural to relinquish our `` three-squares-a-day '' mentality . after all , what could be more natural than eating ? problem is ... we are digging our graves ... with our teeth . if nature 's way is powerful , then transformation is even more powerful . if you are ill , if your cholesterol is high , if you are atherosclerotic or hypertensive , if you have diabetes , if you have an autoimmune disorder , could there be a chance that you 've developed the foregoing condition ( s ) one bite at a time ? could there be a chance that you 've eaten your way to disease ? if so , dr. fuhrman 's claims of recapturing and restoring ones health are valid . this is n't quack medicine . to wit , he cites hundreds of scientific studies which he , himself , collated in his `` chapter notes . '' i must admit i was skeptical upon reading this book . after all , how can we improve our health by cutting off our own fuel supply i reasoned ? upon initiating a gentle refeeding program at the end of a seven-day fast , i found that i had more energy than ever before . i also made a self-discovery during the fast : i had a sinister food addiction . sinister , because this addiction was unbeknownst to me until i started to fast . i discovered that throughout my adult life , i had simply been eating when i did not need to eat . life-threatening diseases do not always shout at us with warning signs . they rather whisper . toxins in the body do not always announce their presence . i have always questioned the misnomer of `` sudden death . '' is a death really sudden if it represents the culmination of self abuse and a behaviorally-driven , ongoing toxic lifestyle ? do n't we give greater precedence to cleaning our cars , than we do to cleaning the machinations of our own bodies ? do we honestly believe that a protein-rich , sugar-saturated , fat-based diet is helping us ? look around you . obesity is ubiquitous . perhaps you , yourself , are overweight or obese , or wallowing in a seemingly endless downward spiral of disease and debilitation . there is hope . you can indeed , as dr. fuhrman claims , recoup good health . not only can you function with a few relatively simple modifications , you can also flourish . conversely , you can , as they say , `` continue to do what you 've always done , and you will deserve to get what you 've always got . '' for the price of six big macs , you can do a `` 180 '' by simply investing in this book . this book will change your life ... forever . sorry i am indeed to only award it five stars when it deserves a galaxy
