inexorable , and thereby lies its dark persuasion living in a milieu far removed from his intoxicating days as a rising painter gaining increasing esteem for his flattering portraits , henry macalpine has isolated himself in a form of penance ... perhaps the penance is for the things he did , for his past selfishnessnes , his past surrender to the `` establishment '' , the easy painting that would please and sell swiftly rather than the more difficult portraitures that strip down , as he puts it , to the skull and even to the soul . but my sense is that his penance is not really for these things . it is for what he will do ... iain pears is a writer of distinction . more than that , although he writes literature that i believe will be enjoyed by readers of wit centuries from now , pears is also a writer who can tell a rattling good story . his turn of phrase - delicious ! i grew to know this henry macalpine as he unburdens himself to his subject , so that macalpine was not just painting a portrait of the self-satisfied old friend , the `` great '' critic william naysmith , but he is also painting a portrait of himself . we see it all - his attitude to sexuality , religion , penance , art , men , women , crime , superficiality , everything . we see how he has altered and developed , and how he has remained what he is , for in the flowing change and in the constancy both ... that is where the truth and validity of a human being lies . we change . we do not change . that is our lot . perhaps in this sense , at the mercy of events , we are true to macalpine 's vision of humanity - ludicrous in the face of the great forces such as a storm . but macalpine in all his imperfect self is also revealed by his monologue ... and we know we do not take his view as a point of absolute truth ( a lovely trick , that . pears did the same thing in `` instance of the fingerpost '' , leaving an unsettling notion that the last narrator was the `` real '' truth , but careful reading reveals that it is all just ... points of view , self-deceptions , however true the narrator attempts to be ) . perhaps , then , we are not so ludicrous , and perhaps we transcend the forces of nature . iain pears 's palette-rich writing shows such a balance of line and colour in the careful choice of words , phrases , flow of written thoughts . i can almost smell the texture - it is like `` reading '' a painting . the book glows with colour , the subtle highlights of the artist 's brush . some reviewers have not taken to the monologue style used in this book - i found it extremely effective , and also such a delicious irony in that the critic , wordy and pompous as he clearly was , has absolutely no say here . he is drawn to macalpine 's retreat in what seems at first his own choice , but right from the start , i sensed that this was not exactly the case . iain pears leads the reader through an extraordinary thread of narrative that is remembrance through the eyes of one man . we learn of macalpine 's fascination with the image of death , the futility of man in the grip of forces greater than he is , an image of decaying flesh washed up on the shore . we learn also ( but suspect it early on ) what macalpine considers the real crime that would impel a certain act of murder . that the denouement is inevitable and foreseen by the reader does not diminish the fascination of this wonderfully dark novel . pears could have written a different book , a book in which the reader is `` fooled '' ? la typical thriller plots . but this book is not a thriller . it is a portrait that creates knowledge , and paints ever more deeply to find motivations and reasons and shadings and colourings , not merely the bare facts . consider this : we know within quite a few pages what is to come . but like garc ? a marquez 's extraordinary `` chronicle of a death foretold '' , it 's not what ... it 's why , how ... give us the details ; it 's the details we want . i found this work very satisfying . i did not find the monologue style tedious at all , and as soon as i realised pears wanted us to suspect what was coming , i read not to find out the end , but to `` read '' the brush-strokes . for those who will approach it in this way , i think that there is a gripping and fascinating reading experience waiting for you . for those who want a twist in the tail with an unexpected ending , no ... this miniature portrait of a book is probably not for you . read the book as a revelation of the skull and soul of two men , and perhaps you too will love this book as much as i did
