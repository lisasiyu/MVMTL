well written mr norris i brought this book to kill some time on holiday . but when i picked it up i could not put it down . bob norris , an experienced naval aviator is also a pretty good author which is not often the case when these millitary types pick up a pen . the novel describes a fly off competition to pick a new fighter/bomber but all is not as it seems as the hosts have a hidden agenda . each fighter/bomber has 5 events to prove it 's worth and the one fault this book has is bob should have put more flying sequences into the competion events instead of just giving a brief summary of what they did and the results in some cases . the parts of the novel dealing with the fly offs are top drawer and if you like your aviation in books then read fly off . keep those books coming mr norri
