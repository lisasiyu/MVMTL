great discussion group book a good read . hurston does an excellent job of depicting the parallel experiences of the captivity of the israelites and the american slave . in fact , one could argue that the experience of the israelites is the american slave experience . this is a great book for high school reading , it provides a variety of cause and effect themes that all young adults need to know ; among them , if you oppress a people or person you breed fear , insecurity , and eventual self hatred in that human . i highly recommend their eyes were watching god another of hurston 's literary jewels . jewels
