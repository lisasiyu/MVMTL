mr. godin rides again ! a triumph for those marching to a different drummer ! from the remarkable book structuring ( the `` chapters '' are organized in alphabetical order ) to the intriguingly insightful commentary , seth godin has once again created a work of excellence . the book is an easy read , but at the same time leaves the mind reeling with thoughts of `` oh my , i need to fix that , or do that , or change that . '' i found the chapter on `` clean fire trucks '' particularly interesting , as i had just 2 months earlier finished an innovation article on `` retiring the fire trucks '' -- which deals with the same concept of preventing fires and not letting them start in the first place ! ( as such , you can then have time to clean the fire trucks , or as i put it , to retire them altogether ! ) . his rants are compelling yet at the same time hilarious ( hilarious in the sense of all the silly things we do as a people that we really should n't be doing ) . take for example his rant on `` wrappers '' and how the method of packaging both the tangible and intangible create an aura around the product that determines how the product is perceived , received , and applied . one might say , `` it 's the wrapper , stupid . '' once again , mr. godin has helped to `` validate my existence '' ( despite my intense self-certainty ! ) by showing that the crazy , `` outside the box '' ( hey , can we just shred the box , then burn it in effigy of the outdated strategies and the consultants who promote them ? ) , simplifying , forward-looking , remarkable , visionary adventures we can lead our clients and companies on are really worth the effort . in short , less is more , small is big , and remarkable is just that : remarkable . this book is remarkable . i strongly encourage adding it to your shelf , then spreading the virus of its contents to others . p.s . the entire ending `` bonus section '' on blogs and other resources is something not to be missed , and single-handedly justifies the purchase
