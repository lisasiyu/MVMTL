barry outdoes his previous form dave barry writes as though he were elmore leonard on speed . it is hard to say exactly where the plot loses and contact with reality and possibility , but at the end you have to sit back and laugh and blow a sigh of satisfaction and relief that such things can not happen , such people can not actually exist . quite . like leonard , barry 's characters get their motivations , a lot of them , from the draw of the illegal , the desire to make big quickly . they are such strange people , each one perhaps , just , possible , and yet thrown together they interact in ways that could never be real . and barry keeps the entire thing just teetering on the edge between hysteria and tragedy , leaving his readers poised to fall either way , and laughing the entire time , both from the absurd humour and from relief . i do n't know how many other books barry has since written , novels , i mean , not his humour columns ( this was his debut fiction ) , but i shall have to read them and leave his newspaper offerings alone . they , the columns , are n't even in the same realm , let alone league
