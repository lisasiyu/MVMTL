excellent the best work by twain i 've read to date . this combination history , memoir , travelogue , and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining . i have also learned a great deal about twain , his time , and the history of steamboating and the mississippi . written later in his life , this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus . highly recommended
