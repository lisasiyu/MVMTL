great animal lovers book if you do n't already have this book , get it . it will not be a duplicate of something you already have . my wife and i saw critters we did n't know existed , and we 're both passionate about critters . the author has a great writing style , the photography is excellent , the book covers a broad diversity of fauna . it 's not a field guide , not a biology text , it 's fun and it 's top notch . i envy a previous reviewer that has been out on field trips with this guy
