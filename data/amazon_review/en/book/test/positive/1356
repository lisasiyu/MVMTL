top notch whodunit p.d . james , aka phyllis dorothy james white , has painted the mystery genre with a literary hue which has delighted fans for decades . her writing is stylish and extremely well-crafted . her characters are so fully developed that they seem almost like friends the reader delights in meeting again . james ' heroine in this book , cordelia grey , lacks the long and rich legacy of adam dalgliesh - the author 's usual sharp-witted and charming p.i. , but she does pack a wallop in the two books she appears in . mature and wise beyond her years - cordelia is only 22 when we meet her - this heroine knows how to draw us into the murder at hand - in this case the neglected but privileged son of a powerful scientist . brave and insightful sometimes , scared and confused often , cordelia soldiers through this mystery from one deduced fact to the next and arrives at a somewhat unusual ( for this genre ) denoument . i wo n't tell you what that is but it causes a bemused adam dalgliesh to pop up at the end of the book in a half-hearted attempt to break down cordelia 's defenses . cordelia is an appealing and well-drawn character who only appeared in two of james ' novels . she later , mistakenly she says , sold cordelia , or the rights to her existence anyway , to the bbc , which subsequently did a tv series based on the character . i picked up this book as a dog-eared paperback in a used book store because the title kept popping up in lists of `` bests '' for this genre - most recently in an essay by anna quindlan . i have n't read a mystery in years but found myself really enjoying this one - for the story , the lovable cordelia , and for the craftsmanship of the author . recommended
