connecting the dots i read this book in record time . greg palast took all the pieces of the jigsaw over the last few decades and put them together in a succinctly written way to make me see in a new light this 'government ' . i am ashamed that our own us media is no longer emboldened to fight this hypocrisy we call a government . from iran to iran contra to iraq and the oil fields , from the halliburtons and all the cronys names who have been hiding for so many years doing so much harm . thanks for opening my eyes and giveing me a new insite into how easily our democracy can be turned without the participation of all the people . and how important freedom of the press and the fourth estate is to your democracy
