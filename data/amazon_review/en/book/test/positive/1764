must read reviewed by debra gaynor for reader views ( 10/06 ) from the moment i saw the cover of this book i knew that i would find pain within . the pain of a young man facing the abusive life he 's survived . `` emmy , the events we lived through taught me to be sure of nothing about other people . they taught me to expect danger around every corner . they taught me to understand that there are people in this world who mean you harm . and sometimes they 're people who say they love you . '' chillingly matt recounts the night he sneaked into the kitchen and took an oreo . his mother , nikki , held a knife to his throat and cut him , to teach him to never again steal . this is just one incident in the nightmare he calls childhood . matt 's father was gone but matt could n't blame him , after all he too was terrified of nikki . for a while murdoch seemed to offer some protect from their mother , but , he too found himself unable to cope with the destructive behavior of nikki . he cared but was it enough ? matt knew it was up to him . he knew he had to find a way to get his two sisters and himself away from , their mother , nikki , before she destroyed them all . matt turned to his father ben for help , but ben was too afraid of his former wife to rescue his own children . this is the story of a brother 's attempt to protect his younger sister from their abusive mother . the story is told in the format of letters from matt to his dear sister , emmy , trying to explain and warn her about life with their abusive mother . `` as i sit here writing , part of me hopes that you go along happily your whole life and never need or want to know the details . '' this book is painful to read . but it should be read . there are many children facing the same situation and we , as society , must stop turning our backs on our precious children . this book is well written . the type is large enough for tired eyes to easily read it . the characters are so real that you cry for them . i found myself wanting to snatch them from their mother 's insane antics and give them safety . i highly recommend `` rules of survival '' for older youth and adults .
