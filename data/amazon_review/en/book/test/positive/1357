activities galore ! this is an excellent book for emergent level readers . i really liked the many quarter fold books which focus on both letter/sound recognition and high frequency words . i have used these activities in small group , as independent practice , as homework and in my literacy centers . also included are manuscript printing practice pages that work well as homework due to the detailed letter formation instructions on each page , class books , poetry , and letter cards . what a valuable resource - thank you
