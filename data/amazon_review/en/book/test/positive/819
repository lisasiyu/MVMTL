apart from one scene scaring me , i loved this movie . the first time i saw this movie , there was one scene which scared me ; the scene where mary 's parents are dying from the plague ( i think it was cholera ? ) . the music they use for this can send chills down someone 's back ; i know because it did mine . apart from that , i loved the movie . i do n't know why they had to have dickon killed , though . ( ben weatherstaff and mary talk at the end of the movie ; we find out that dickon was killed in the war . ) i like how colin and mary meet at the end and how mary held off on saying yes to colin 's marriage proposal until they were together in the garden . something else i 'm wondering : was this movie set during world war 1 or world war 2 ?
