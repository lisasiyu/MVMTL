the book on intelligence operations during world war ii this is an extremely detailed book on allied ( mainly british ) deception operations during world war ii . while it was written in 1976 it still hold up well , though some new information on the role of gchq and signals intelligence has been released since 1976 . i am still amazed at the scope of operations the british ran during world war ii . a very well written book , though it is by know means a quick read . it took me almost a month to get through it . if you are keenly interested in intelligence operations try to track down this book
