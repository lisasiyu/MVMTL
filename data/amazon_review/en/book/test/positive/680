elizabeth george in shorts elizabeth george in shorts is just as suspensful and whimsical as she is doing the long novel . normally , i do n't read short stories but decided to do so after finishing all of the inspector lynley books . i definitely was not disappointed . this lady comes with a great sense of humour in addition to her other sterling literary attributes . all the stories were suspensful right up to the final unexpected endings . i , richard , the last of the stories , transforms history into modern day life . both sad and amusing
