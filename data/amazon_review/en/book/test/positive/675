very helpful , encouraging , and informative ! ! ! this is an excellent resource for women with endo and for those who love them . i was encouraged by reading other women 's stories to remind me that i am not alone . my husband has also learned a lot from the book and has become more sympathetic . it is a relatively easy read and is the best endo book that i have found . the book also has a sense of humor which is essential for anyone with endo . my only wish is that the book would have gone more in depth concerning alternative methods for treatment . overall , an awesome resource
