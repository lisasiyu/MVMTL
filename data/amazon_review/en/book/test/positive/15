a phd who deserves the respect he gets as a matter of fact martin zweig is one of the few phds who 's `` able '' to explain even somewhat complicated subjects in plain words . the same thing ca n't be said about the contemporary authors of various market , finance or economics books published over the last years . hands down , this is one of the best and one of the most ( again ) simple books ever written on wall street . it provided me with new insights on different aspects of trading and economics in general , like the four percent model indicator , the monetary model , the mutual funds cash/assets ratio , the three crucial conditions for bear markets . there were also other brief and concise ideas which seem to stand the test of time , like `` it 's ok to monitor the crowd and go against it , but you only want to do so when the crowd is extremely one-sided '' , `` recognizing the relationship between trends and the industries that might benefit from them can lead to above normal returns '' , `` if you could just eliminate the worst 10 % of all stocks and choose even randomly from the rest , you would certainly beat the market '' . and the most surprising of them all ( at least to me ) : `` there seems to be some inborn reasoning in wall street that better profits mean higher stock prices , but this simply is not true in aggregate . the best gains made in bull markets tend to come in the first six months of a fresh bull market , when profits are usually declining '' . but when it comes to the brass tacks of his methodology , i think the best part of this book is the one about scanning the financial section . his method of picking the winners by simply checking the latest quarterly figures in company sales and earnings in the daily financial section of the wall street journal or the new york times and the process he goes through afterwards , until deciding in the end which ones to buy is simple , yet very powerful . i do n't know why , but almost every single page of this book reminded me of the legendary jesse livermore and his valuable and immortal lessons . after reading m. zweig 's book you 'll never invest the same way as before . `` winning on wall street '' is an intelligent and insightful investing book , yet simple to understand . rather than trying to razzle-dazzle the reader , this book explains why it is so important to stick to simple concepts and rules such as `` buy strength and sell weakness , stay in gear with the tape , the trend is your friend , etc '' ; rules you have read and heard about a gazillion times before , but which are so easy to violate ! as a trader once said : `` the market is the train , so be the caboose '' .
