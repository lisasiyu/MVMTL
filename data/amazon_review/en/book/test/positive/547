teachers united as a high school teacher i was surprised and pleasantly amused to hear that jon stewart had decided to make a teacher 's edition of anything . when i found out that a colleague of mine had decided to buy the book and reference it in a history class i thought that i should look it over and see if it was worth its weight in satire . it is definitely worth its weight in something . i find that the daily show 's viewpoint is refreshing and that jon stewart 's attempts at unraveling the political veil is essential to what we consider democracy . the citizen 's guide to democracy inaction is a good reference and cocktail party conversation starter . i think that most of the book is interesting but i would n't want my child to come home and quote verbatim some of the blather that is inside . as a book for the masses sure . as a book intended for teachers no . i suppose that is the joke of it all . no teacher should use this text as a real reference or they would probably end up on 60 minutes or the daily show explaining why their students were arrested for harrassing supreme court justices with naked pictures
