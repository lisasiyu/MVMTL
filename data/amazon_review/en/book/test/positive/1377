faithful translation of the word of god i have studied some greek and the original texts , and i must say many modern bibles are corrupting the word of god , no only in the unliteral translations but faulty originals they use . the king james version is faithful , both in being literal and using authentic texts . the new king james version is faithful in this attempt , the only changes being bringing the bible into more modern , but still respectful , english , and a few clarifications of words which have changed their meanings . i recommend it to all christians
