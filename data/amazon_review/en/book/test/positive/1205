le myst√®re magnifique ! beatrice `` bede '' dunn became fascinated with wild orchids when she got a summer job with the ontario ministry of the environment . they sent her to the bruce peninsula to map orchids . she spent three months there , wandering around the woodlands , doing some serious hiking and camping-out . when she returned in the fall with fifty rolls of film , she had a new avocation - wild orchid hunting . bede became passionate about `` documenting the existence of a single flower or the breeding ground of a particular species . '' in 1984 she and her boyfriend , scott , went on a hiking holiday in the dordogne region of southwestern france . when it began to rain , the couple had an argument about whether to leave their camp and seek shelter elsewhere or to stay put . bede was adamant about remaining and so she did - alone . when scott returned two days later the tent and their things were still at the campsite , but bede was gone , along with her camera , backpack , michelin guide and a book on wildflowers and orchids . no one ever saw the young woman again . after a massive search and investigation , which garnered much publicity , no evidence of foul play was discovered , no body , no crime scene . mara dunn , bede 's identical twin , has never resigned herself to the loss of her sister . she moved to the dordogne after her divorce became final and went into the interior design business , all the while maintaining contact with the police . nothing concrete , however , was found concerning the disappearance . during an antique hunting expedition in a near-by town , mara discovered an old canon camera in a pile of junk . she noticed it immediately , even though the case was mildewed and worn , because it was identical to the cameras her parents had given her and her sister for their high school graduation . she was sure it was the camera her sister had traveled to france with . inside the case the initials `` b. d. '' were written , and inside the camera was an undeveloped roll of film . damaged by time and dampness , but still viable , thirty-four photographs were revealed upon development , of wild orchids and a dovecote , taken in what appears to be the local landscape . mara is convinced the photographs document her sibling 's final days . now , almost twenty years after bede vanished , mara , with the photographs in hand , makes yet another effort to find her sister , or her remains . julian wood is an english expatriate living in dordogne and an expert on wild orchids . he is also the author of `` wildflowers of the dordogne/ fleurs sauvages de la dordogne , '' and the man mara wants to assist her . she asks him to help her retrace her sister 's footsteps using the photographs as a guide . julian is skeptical about turning up anything new on the missing woman . he does n't really want to get involved and he does n't care much for pushy , intense women . besides , the police have copies of the photographs and do n't seem very excited by them . when julian views the final picture though , he becomes agitated and as motivated to begin a search as mara , but for different reasons . the photo is of a cypripedium - sabot de venus in french , sometimes called lady 's slipper in english . and since this rare wild orchid does not grow in the dordogne , or anywhere in europe , he has his own mystery to unravel - if he decides to become involved with mara and her investigation . not only is `` deadly slipper '' a good literary mystery , it is really a fun book to read . filled with an exotic cast of characters - from the local bogeyman and his mother , who is even scarier than her son , to the bizarre sauvignac family , ( the local nobility ) , to julian wood 's fanatic orchid hunting nemesis and competitor , and the regulars down at chez nous , the town 's cafe/bar/gourmet restaurant , plus a french police inspector and his lads , these personages all enrich the narrative . the horticulture tidbits are fascinating , and i 'm no gardener . the description of food , wine , the gorgeous countryside - c'est tres magnifique ! the setting is france ! there is even some romancing going on in between gruesome discoveries . you can not go wrong , especially if you 're looking for something different in sleuthing . jan
