quite effective ... but not all that affective . which is not a bad thing at all . unless there are noble attempts at such a thing , which , i suppose , is really up to debate with this work . but what expectations can one have with a work like this ? what the reader has here is not really a `` novel '' but something greater , something post- , something meta- ( although in a bearable way , at least barnes has taste ) . it is , however , quite educational , very witty , very stylish ( in a good way , see `` barnes has taste '' in the previous sentence for more on this ) but also often quite maladroit , even if in a skillfull way . sometimes , especially in the times when the focus is shifted to the narrator , it feels like the story is being poked into an uncomfortable position , before it returns to its natural form in the next chapter ( like the metal in braces ! ) . but , it is , at the very least , a rewarding book and at the best quite brilliant . very muchso indeed
