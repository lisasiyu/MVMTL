oh wow the & quot ; simply & quot ; series was my first carley books to read . i love her fast paced stories . they are the kind that grab you and dont let go till long after the end . i loved all three books , but i would have to say that this one is my favorie . it is very sensual and had me turning the pages so fast it took only about two hours for me to read the aweseome story . ill be looking for any other titles by carley and snatch them up as fast as possible . i cant wait for what she has in store for us next
