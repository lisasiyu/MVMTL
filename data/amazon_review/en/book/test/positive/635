where de soto started - a brave statement i love the little jibe provided within the title of hernando de soto 's `` the other path . '' it 's a poke at `` the shining path '' ( sendero luminoso ) , the maoist peruvian terrorist organization that wreaked havoc on de soto 's homeland beginning in 1980. de soto 's attempt in this book is to show that the more effective struggle is to make capitalism more efficient . to those who know de soto 's work , the solutions are well known : build a system of laws that allow one 's residents to buy , sell and value property rights ; and reduce the complexities and banalities of starting a business . if you 've read de soto 's master work `` the mystery of capitalism , '' then there is no new news here . in fact , `` the other path '' will look out-of-date with its yellowing statistics . so why the five stars ? as a testament to de soto 's bravery . think about the guts it took for him to research and publish this book in peru during the tumultuous and frightening period there . what a statement .
