if at all interested , a must-read firstly , i must say that it is very difficult to summarize this book in any way . the complexity ( and importance ) of the material is such that there is no substitute for a direct , mindful read . however , if you are looking for a very worthwhile attempt at summarization , i suggest you read the review by abc `` bb '' ( i was persuaded to purchase by this review ) . many reviewers have commented that `` choosing reality '' is an `` easy read '' . while i do agree to an extent , it seems necessary to note that these comments are true only in relation to other books of the same nature . considering the complexity of the subject matter , yes , this book is an easy read . in comparison to most literature , however , this `` easy read '' statement is perhaps less plausable . my point is this : do not expect this book to be simple ( firstly , because it is n't ; secondly , because it should n't be ) . this is of double importance if the reader is of a traditional , western mindset . the content of `` choosing reality '' ( especially the latter chapters ) takes time to fully absorb . in fact , this book was , for me , the anti-thesis of a 'quick read ' . that said , i must say that i enjoyed every long minute of it . wallace does a wonderful job showing the flaws in scientific realism and instrumentalism , chronicaling the histories and the theories of each . he then thoroughly explains the comprimise , the middle way , the buddhist way : a centrist view of reality . while the presentation of the centrist view was invaluable in its own right , the most enjoyable sections of the book came after this presentation . wallace undertakes the very difficult task of using language to describe how the centrist view can be applied to our lives . rather than just offering a theory , he describes how the centrist view deals with the mind , the nature of `` physical reality '' , and the illusory `` self '' . the author earnestly argues that the implications of the centrist view are real ; implications that will certainly force you to re-evaluate the world you live in . the beauty of this book is that it caters to any audience . there is enough science to make it rational and reasonable ; there is enough buddhism to make it real and applicable . i consider this book of utmost importance to anyone interested in modern physics , buddhism , the nature of reality , and/or the self . finally , i must note that as much as this book is a religious view of science , it is equally ( albeit more subtly ) a scientific view of religion . as perhaps wallace 's greatest triumph in this book , modern science and religion are shown to be infinintely complimentary , both ultimately striving to understand the same things : the nature of reality and our role in it . to this end , `` choosing reality '' is a must read
