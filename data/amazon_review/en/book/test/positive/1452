a proud korean parent i am very proud to be a korean parent because i read this book . this book explains the suffering of the korean parents all over america . korean children often do not appreciate all the difficulties their parents had to go through to give them the university of california education . many korean parents work in harsh conditions and work long hours and experience all kinds of anti-korean insults by whites . this book explains the pain that korean parents had to go through . it is difficult to explain all my pain to my children . it 's difficult when they are young because i do n't want to burden them . it 's difficult when they are old because it seems petty and they seem to be going through problems of their own . but korean parents suffer in america as immigrants who work hard to reach middle class . this book is great because i can just give to my children to read and they can understand my hardships just by reading about it . i have friends who ca n't even speak english so they ca n't communicate to their children about their experiences . for such a korean parent , this book is ideal . i recommended this book to them
