flip it ! ! ! ... ... ... .. flip it good ! flip the switch is an excellent book . i 'm 29 and tired of being overweight . i bought this book months ago . i read half of it , then moved from seattle to valdez , alaska . all the while i was moving , i could not stop thinking about this book . as soon as my shipment arrived , i found the book asap and finished it . i have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books . i look at it this way : spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $ 10.00 for a resistance rope - plus - you get to do this in the privacy of your home . this is a great idea , especially for women that have children , a job and the home to contend with . jim karas was overweight for several years . he can relate to me . he revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because i simply can not handle cardio workouts due to a bad back . the running and `` stepping '' in cardio is too much for me . this is a great book for anyone but women will especially appreciate the convenience
