what you did n't know about opium ... `` opium : a history '' by martin booth is an engrossing work of nonfiction that details human reliance on opium for thousands upon thousands of years and how it has affected us physically , emotionally , economically , and morally . the book starts with a discussion on the poppy flower itself and how opium is derived from the plant 's sap and ending on the efforts of international traffickers , government enforcement agencies , and doctors alike in either expanding or eradicating addiction to opium . in between , you will learn about opium 's horrible effects on the body , britain 's establishment of the opium trade in china and later efforts to destroy it ( counter to the rest of the world 's reliance on opium to support their economies ) , the transformation of opium to heroin , the use of opium to inspire artists around the world , and the quiet and insidious opium trade that goes on with the permission of many governments to support war efforts and other international issues . to me , the most fascinating thing i learned from this book was the amount of people addicted to the drug in the past because it was such an important painkiller/medicine and because it helped quiet fussy babies . you ca n't help finish this book and wonder if it is even possible to win a war against a drug that has shaped the lives of so many humans and so many societies for thousands of years . i personally found the book easy to read , though i preferred the first two-thirds of the book . this part of the book covered the drug itself , its health affects , and its early history up to the nineteenth century . i was n't as interested in the international trafficking part of the book ( the last one-third ) , probably because so many people , organizations , and countries were mentioned that i lost track of which country was fighting who and who was doing what with heroin or opium . still , the book is an eye-opening read . the excruciating description of opium withdrawal should be mandatory reading for high school kids to help stymie any attempt at trying the drug .
