excellent info , dry writing , exceedingly pc i 'm only half way through this book but i think it has some really great information . my dh and i are planning to adopt but have n't officially started the process yet . this book is giving us lots of issues to think about . it provides good examples of positive language for discussing adoption with your child . the author does n't shy away from the hard issues like racism or a history of incest . she does a great job of integrating child/teen development into all issues . she cites many studies to support her advice . the writing is rather dry ( much like my own ) and academic , which is actually useful . i trust this author because her writing is n't colored by a lot of emotion . she uses plenty of real-life examples from the experiences of adoptive families . the book does suffer a little from being broad and trying to address all flavors of adoption ( domestic & international , same race and transracial ) . i highly reccomend this book to anyone considering adoption as a way to start conversations with your spouse about the hard issues you will face as adoptive parents . might even be a good idea to share it with extended family
