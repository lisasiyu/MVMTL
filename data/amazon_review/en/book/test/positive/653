another great oregon files book ! you will not be disappointed as juan cabrillo and his crew aboard the oregon once again take center stage in this , the 3rd book in the oregon files series . this series has had my attention from the beginning as the idea of an entire crew of `` heroes '' headed by cabrillo is a fresh new twist on cussler 's long history of sea-going adventures starring either dirk pitt or kurt austin . this series allows the cussler enthusiast yet another new book to look forward to on a regular basis . long live juan cabrillo and the oregon ! ! !
