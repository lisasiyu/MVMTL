the bad boys are good ! i thoroughly enjoyed this book . if you 've read as many mountaineering books as i have , eventually you may read a dozen accounts of the same epic mountaineering tragedy . even if i 'd heard the story before i was enchanted with the burgess viewpoint . i also encountered some of the tales about the twins ' antics in other books . and i was delighted to hear them tell their own stories . their respect for the local people and customs was very important to me . it 's a much better world with the burgess twins in it ! thanks for sharing your stories with the rest of us
