read books written by sitting supreme court justices i think that it is good to read widely and get divergent perspectives . thus , christians and jews should read the quran and muslims should read the torah and the new testament . conservatives should read the nation or the new republic and visit the dailykos website and liberals should read the weekly standard or national review and visit realclearpolitics . the same perspective applies with breyer 's book . regardless of your perspective , you should read this brief and easily understandable statement of judicial philosophy from a sitting supreme court justice . ( and , it would also be good to read the earlier counterpoint from justice scalia for the same reasons . ) breyer 's book is a slightly revised and edited version of lectures he 's delivered over the past few years . it is therefore a mix of the spoken and written word which has advantages and disadvantages . there 's an easy informality conveyed from the `` spoken '' parts of the text that make the book almost conversational . at the same time , there is the disorganization and carelessness that results from spoken delivery . thus , sometimes the text is clear and orderly , the way written text often is , and other times it is a bit confusing and meandering the way text from speech often is . if you want to study the book like a student , this style can get in your way and it also opens the book to criticism that may be correct , but unfair for the format ( the mixed combination of written and spoken delivery ) . breyer narrates his perspective on judging with a fairly simple description of his approach and then several examples to expand , elaborate , and demonstrate this perspective . he argues that this perspective ( `` active liberty '' ) is useful in understanding constitutional law and that it should be employed widely by other judges . he also directly compares his method to the `` literalist '' approach outlined by justice scalia . while most of the narrative is written at a level the common reader can grasp , the details of breyer 's perspective and the examples he provides appear to me to require a deeper knowledge of constitutional law for true appreciation . i would strongly recommend that anyone with any remote interest in our constitution and the supreme court should read this book ( and the counterpoint from scalia ) . it is brief , readable , straightforward , and highly accessible to the common reader . on a more negatively critical note of the perspective breyer describes , i have to express my surprise at the inherent danger in the approach . breyer recommends that judges try to understand the purpose and consequence of the law in question and use an interpretation of purpose and consequence that relies upon the `` active liberty '' conceptualization . ( briefly , active liberty describes the actions of good citizenship . breyer believes that the constitution is designed in part to encourage people to be good democratic citizens and that it is good to interpret law from this view . ) breyer takes the notion of active liberty from a prior source , benjamin constant and his essay , `` the liberty of ancients compared with that of moderns , '' ( available for free online if you do a search ) . thus , breyer is clearly and directly arguing that judges should go beyond the text of the law ( and all the information in the controversy ) and use an active meaning-making process to figure out what 's really going on . the most obvious danger to this approach is the variation in meaning-making of different people . would a liberal-minded person really want a judge like jesse helms to use his personal meaning-making process ; likewise would a conservative want a judge like ted kennedy to use his personal meaning-making process ? breyer seems to dismiss the obvious psychological variation that has to exist in different judges and assumes that each one can somehow correctly divine the true meaning of `` active liberty '' and then properly apply it in interpreting law . the dangers and risk to this assumption seem transparent to me but not to justice breyer . maybe they teach that at harvard law and , alas , i 've only visited that beautiful campus . my background as a graduate professor in persuasion and attitudes , an observer of myself and others , and my religious beliefs would strongly argue that people always want to justify themselves , their beliefs , and their actions . justice breyer 's argument that people can overcome their psychology with his approach is not foolish or careless or impertinent ; it is to my education , training , and experience , wrong . perhaps the best evidence of this is to first read breyer 's take on the meaning of `` active liberty '' as he perceives it from constant 's essay and then second read constant 's essay for yourself and see how you understand what constant meant about `` active liberty . '' my problem is that i 've read constant 's essay and justice breyer 's take on `` active liberty '' swerves more than just a little bit from what constant writes . in particular note in your reading of constant 's brief essay these statements : `` it follows from what i have just indicated that we can no longer enjoy the liberty of the ancients , which consisted in an active and constant participation in collective power . our freedom must consist of peaceful enjoyment and private independence . '' `` similarly , the people who , in order to enjoy the liberty which suits them , resort to the representative system , must exercise an active and constant surveillance over their representatives , and reserve for themselves , at times which should not be separated by too lengthy intervals , the right to discard them if they betray their trust , and to revoke the powers which they might have abused . '' `` the danger of modern liberty is that , absorbed in the enjoyment of our private independence , and in the pursuit of our particular interests , we should surrender our right to share in political power too easily . . . . let us ask the authorities to keep within their limits . '' justice breyer could have easily avoided this line of criticism by simply saying he wants to take an old concept , active liberty , and give it new meaning . he could acknowledge constant and then develop `` active liberty '' to mean what he wants it to mean . he would thus avoids any complaints about inconsistent reading of an old text and any potential finger-pointing about intellectual theft . but , he did n't do that because he thinks his interpretation of constant 's essay is correct . he knows how to correctly make meaning . and he does that when he judges constitutional law , too .
