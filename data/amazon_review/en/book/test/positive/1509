words of wisdom from tv ? amazing ! this is a fun little book chock full of wise sayings gleaned from episodes of the original star trek . the original was not a space opera , it was a futurized series of life 's lessons , very carefully crafted . each episode had a heavy-duty message embedded within -- and not very hard to spot either . this book does not necessarily include these thematic messages , but it does excerpt a number of pithy , humorous quotes from the characters . it is highly reminiscent of a poster my dentist has in his office of everything i need to know i learned in kindergarten . i expect there is also a book with that name , but i have n't read it . these words of wisdom also remind me of dr. akin 's famous `` laws of spacecraft design '' which you can access on the internet . with his permission , i used several in my book `` the knowledge management and information technology encyclopedia '' ( published by the government and not for sale ) . my favorite submits from marinaccio 's delightful book are : gossip is often confused with conversation . in fact it often takes the place of conversation . take gossip away from some folks and they would turn into mimes . p.61 when everyone is responsible , ultimately no one is responsible . p.52 idiot-proofing is also genius-proofing . p.94 great people talk about ideas . average people talk about things . small people talk about people . p.61 attitude is the top priority ; after attitude , talent or gifts are important . p.64 as yogi berra , the great yankees catcher , once said , `` you can observe a lot , just by watching . '' p.23 a person who understands a rule knows when to break it . p.50 competent people know which rules to follow and which to ignore ... when people of good judgement are allowed to exercise their insights , good results usually follow . when people=s hands are tied , they are ineffective . p.94 the more complex the mind , the greater the need for the simplicity of play . pp . 8 , 53 , & 54 difficult choices expose how we truly feel . what we believe deep inside . p.39 the most important time to help someone is when they need it . p.8 for man , utopia is endless challenge . p.1
