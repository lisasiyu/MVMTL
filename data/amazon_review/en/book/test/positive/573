well done and thorough as someone new to martial arts but not to stretching , this book is a great resource . years of dance training taught me the importance of stretching but there was a lot i 'd forgotten and some i 'd never learned in the first place . it 's so helpful to have the author explain , in plain english , how stretching works and why some exercises are successful while others are a waste of time . i also found the harder and easier variations for each exercise a big help in modifying some of the exercises to suit what i need as i work on my flexibility at home between classes . highly recommended for anyone looking to become more flexible or just stay in shape .
