let his death crown his life ! i am in ethereal love with mary shelley . why is her literary importance and fancy not uplifted more than it is ? i grimace whenever i go to a bookstore and glance each time at the mary shelley section to find only frakenstein . she has other great books probably not many people know about . such is the case in the last man . i thought frankenstein was about as sad as one could allow a character to feel but after reading the last man mary out does herself by really putting poor verney in a pickle . this story really tugged at me hard and actually made me feel for the characters in a way so few books or movies ever have . if you know about mary shelley and have read frankenstein or anything else by this , i feel , greatest author to have ever put word to paper , then you must read this beautiful accounting of `` the last year of the world '' . it astonished me to find out that the book was out of print from 1833 to 1965 . wow ! i failed to compare the story to such contemporary biological warfare or aids for that matter and took the story 's meaning for what shelley may have wanted to get across during her time that had neither . i believe she wants to almost persuade us of a deeper level of human condition and compassion by taking us as low as we can and then allowing us to constantly strive upward from that awful place she leaves verney . please , read more of mary shelley
