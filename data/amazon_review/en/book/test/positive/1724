a strong west wind : a mighty memoir if you want the opposite of james frey -- that is , if you want to read beautiful , true prose that does n't flinch from the deeper truths , read caldwell . this is a book about west texas , growing up , leaving home , struggling with family , remembering the farm , hating vietnam , going to mexico , reading great books , moving forward . i put a pot of coffee on and read through the night , then passed it on to my dad , who did the same . thanks , ms. caldwell .
