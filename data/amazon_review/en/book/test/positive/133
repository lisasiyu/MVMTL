high iq idiots if this book applies to the rest of the world , and all of history , then most of the evil done is not by evil men , but by highly intelligent , highly educated men who wish to possess great political power so they can do good . but , as the old saying informs us , the road to hell is paved with good intentions . these men had good intentions , but little understanding of how to use it . or of human nature , for that matter . graduates of the most prestigous universities , rich , insulated from the rest of the country , they saw the populace merely as pawns to be used for their ends . halberstam uses the word `` hubris '' many times , and i think his analysis is correct : the men involved ( and in some cases , women ) were far too interested in political power . the book is a warning to those who believe in the power of big government to effect beneficial changes ; that power , unfornately , does not exist . as always , when human fantasies run up against reality , reality always wins out . unfortunately , the people are the ones who suffer , not the politicians and other movers and shakers in government
