very interesting read the best parts of the lost painting : the quest for a caravaggio masterpiece , by jonathan harr , deal with the artist himself . when most artists are considered eccentric , caravaggio was a renegade in his actions . a fighter . he killed a man , and lived his last years on the run . many of his paintings were initially discounted , but his popularity grew in later years . i enjoyed the book , and found the idea of these lost masterpieces , valued in the tens of millions of dollars , to be out there somewhere very fascinating . four stars & recommended .
