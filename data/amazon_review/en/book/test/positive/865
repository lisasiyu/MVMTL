a bad time for motherhood i have been a fan of j.a . jance since i met her in a bookstore browsing through the mystery section . she convinced me to try one of her books , which i did , and loved it . she had also told me that she would soon start a new series - that was many years ago and i 've been enthralled with each new book since the joanna brady series began . these books usually leave you turning pages as fast as you can read , but this one was n't quite that captivating . do n't get me wrong , it was still very good , just not the excellence i 've come to expect from jance 's writing . this is the ninth novel featuring joanna brady , a tough arizona sheriff who enchants her way into the reader 's hearts . in the last novel , devil 's claw we leave joanna as she 's honeymooning with her new husband butch , after having her home destroyed by a maniac . paradise lost picks up shortly thereafter . joanna is once again caught in the struggle to maintain balance between being sheriff , being a new wife , and being a mother to a 12-year-old . while joanna and butch are at a sheriff 's conference across the state , joanna 's daughter , jenny , goes on a girl scout campout . jenny and another girl , dora matthews , sneak off after lights out only to find trouble in a big way . they stumble across a dead body . because the girls were breaking rules , they are sent back to bisbee while the sheriff 's department investigates this murder in apache pass . when dora matthews , turns up dead the next day , joanna is worried about jenny 's safety and the balance between the various hats she wears comes tumbling down around her . added to this second murder , is a third murder - the body of the prime suspect in the first murder turns up . three deaths in a matter of four days are more than bisbee has ever seen and it 's up to joanna to help solve them . the end of paradise lost is predictable and not one of the better suspenseful conclusions that jance has created in the past . j.a . jance has always tied up the loose ends , but this time she leaves one flapping in the gentle arizona breeze . the subplot involving a series of carjackings is never fully developed and leaves much to be desired by the reader . she eludes to this subplot several times , but there is no meat to it and nothing ever comes of it - no tie in to the murders , no interesting side journey , just a passing mention every once in a while . and a low point in this book was joanna 's wavering attitude towards her overbearing mother , eleanor . she finds neutral ground and `` understands '' her mother . i did n't buy it - it was too passe for me . joanna would n't buy into the poor , poor me bit , the martyrdom , that her mother is excellent at portraying . but this time she does and it is very anti-climatic - i wanted a good , old fashioned tongue lashing that we 've come to expect when these two clash . the one thing that is decided in this book is joanna brady will run for reelection as cochise county sheriff . i 'm sure the next book in this series will encompass the campaigning and how it affects butch and jenny . it should be interesting .
