great chess strategy book first of all , i did not go through all examples , but i did read all the chapters . this book is truly super in the depth of coverage . once you gained an advantageous position , how do you plan your attak ? how do you execute it ? all is covered . only gripe : the chapter on phases of attack should have placed right after the chapter on different classic mates
