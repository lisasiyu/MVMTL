loads of fun primality know for his somber novels of great moral dilemmas usually in developing world setting , `` travels with my aunt '' is something of a departure for the great graham greene . with its often absurdly situations this is a deeply comic novel rich in humor . the story centers on henry pulling , a recently retired banker . he is stuffy , unimaginative , and not one prone to fun . shortly after he meets his eccentric aunt , who he has not seen since he was a young child , he ends up on whirlwind travels that are best left for the reader to discover for his or herself . suffice to say , however , the novel is very funny and the new world the travels open up to pulling are only one part of the fun . certaily not one of greene 's deeper works , but definetly one of his more entertaining ones . enjoy
