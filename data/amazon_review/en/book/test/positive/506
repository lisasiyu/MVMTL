great story this book is n't a masterpiece , but it does tell the story of one of america 's best pilots . it tells the life of bob hoover from his eyes . the stories he tells are almost unbelievable ! it was a very entertaining book , i could hardly put it down , and i would recommend it for anyone who is interested in aviation , especially those who like to hear great stories of how aviation has changed over the years
