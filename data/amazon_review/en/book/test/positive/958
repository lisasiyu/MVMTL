a treasury of trucks for the beginning reader & quot ; trucks , & quot ; by byron barton , is an educational treat for the youngest readers . a very simple text accompanies colorful illustrations of many kinds of trucks . we see a garbage truck , delivery truck , tow truck , dump truck , cement mixer , and more . the artwork of this book is distinctive : the crisp illustrations have an almost mathematical precision to them , and are rich in contrasting colors . i give the book an enthusiastic recommendation
