six short stories ( 3 by each author ) on the whole , i was drawn into rm 's stories more quickly than pd 's ( my favourites are `` the sea king 's son '' and `` the water horse '' ) , although after repeated exposure i 've developed some liking for two of his three . mckinley 's stories herein seem to me to have more detailed and polished world-building . none of the six , to my knowledge , have been published previously . `` mermaid song '' ( pd ) setting = very like puritan new england . ( i 'd have enjoyed it more if pd had simply made it an alternate puritan history . ) while the mundane setting may be off-putting at first , the sea-people 's introduction is well handled when it comes . in a way , this is two stories - a family tradition ( handed down from mother to daughter ) and the story of the protagonist , young pitiable nasmith , left with her maternal grandparents upon her mother 's death in childbirth . near the end of her life , pitiable 's grandmother tells her the story behind the most unusual of her songs - how their ancestress charity goodrich really survived shipwreck upon arriving in the new world as a girl . although the people 's culture is n't fleshed out much , the first contact scene between charity and her sea-children rescuers is realistically detailed . in a neat reversal of some sea-people stories , the air-breathing person was a pet , kept in an undersea cave with no way out . the present-day story turns grim when the grandfather takes to drink after his wife 's death , which seems to have quenched what little of his heart survived his daughter 's passing . eventually he takes to walking along the seashore , and finds something that only pitiable has learned to recognize , shaping up to a possible reversal of the secret tradition . `` the sea-king 's son '' ( rm ) jenny , only child of a well-off farming family , grew into shyness as she grew up , and never let on that she had fallen in love with robert , a good-looking younger son of another farming family from a village on the far side of the harbour separating the small towns they live in - a harbour under a curse by the king of the sea people , to avenge an injustice inflicted by the land people in the days when the two races had dealings with one another ( though only a trade in luxury items , never friendship , each race considering the other too alien to grow close to ) . but when jenny 's parents make plans to send her away to the city for a season , in the hope that she might shake off her shyness , and perhaps find a good husband , robert finally makes a move - for love of jenny 's inheritance rather than for her . but late in their courtship , jenny makes an unannounced visit alone to robert 's family home , and what she learns there is more terrible for her than any ancient tale of sea-curses , and drives her onto the shortest road home - the direct route across the harbour . `` sea serpent '' ( pd ) i was disappointed with the initial scene-setting , although the wave-riders eventually won me over a bit . the conflict between the new religion 's chief god and the old 's chief goddess comes to a head as the builder of a new temple seeks building stone taken from the goddess ' shrine ( which seemed unoriginal ) . the magic-working temple-builder forces the neutral wave-riders , worshippers of the sea god , to help transport the stones . the details of the minutiae , practical politics , and ethics of the wave-riders ' work make the latter portion of the story a decent read . `` water horse '' ( rm ) `` this island is a strange place ... a threshold between land and water ; and the boundary between us is striven for , and fought over , and it shifts sometimes this way , and sometimes that ... it is over this one island that the war is fought , and if once we yielded , then all those lands behind us - farther from the boundary we protect - would immediately come under threat , and they have no guardians . we are the guardians ; and here we hold the line . '' so says western mouth to her inland-born apprentice , tamia , who began her training at fourteen as do all apprentices , and ca n't help worrying that she 's not really suitable for the work . but western mouth was a very old woman by the time tamia came along ... when western mouth has a stroke five years into tamia 's apprenticeship , the defenses are torn open , allowing a creature of sea-magic to slip through that tamia must face in her guardian 's stead . `` kraken '' ( pd ) somewhat similar to `` mermaid song '' , although the two humans swept into the water are saved by more supernatural means and for more complex reasons . the protagonist , a young sea-princess indulging in her last rule-breaking before coming of age , runs serious risks to try to return them to the upper air . `` a pool in the desert '' ( rm ) the only damar story herein - not surprising , for a country bordered by desert in the more recent ages of the world . the protagonist , a present-day homelander ( not unlike our own present ) , begins dreaming of a time so far in damar 's past that it has become legend , and finds it far more like home than her parents ' household , with their stranglehold on their children .
