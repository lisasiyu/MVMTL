a girl named zippy the cover photo of an alert non-gerber baby . an old family photo topping each chapter . these help set a whimsical tone skillfully followed through with words only a mother could love . from tufted-head to stubbed-toe , this book celebrates the spunk of youth with countless recalls of which our inner tot can relate . we could long for a dad like hers -- who loved his third child enough to casually coin her zippy . through her eyes , this family does n't take itself too seriously . how zippy organizes and rationalizes daily undertakings is felt as youthful , reads as youthful . the flightiness of friendships , unnerving nature of neighbors and natural distancing from parents are all taken in stride and delicately expressed . she 's a child with shameless pride in plainness . any precociousness is thankfully not odious . this folk-child character seems too clever to be actual , too enlightened to be real , but we 're more than happy to play along . the book 's subtle intrigue -- all well told with a perception that belies its naï¿½ve charm . haven kimmel has pulled off some retro-realism with finesse . a delightful and amusing read .
