this book is a must read if you want to deeply understand persuasion this is a book that you 'll read over and over . you 'll dog ear the pages and turn them yellow with highlighter . there is pure gold to be mined on every page . what makes this book so valuable is the science behind persuasion that mr. hogan explains in easy to understand language . you walk away with a real understanding of how to persuade and why it works . in fact , i found the chapter on the impact of non-verbal communication to be worth the whole price of the book and even more . after i read this book , i was surprised it was n't priced in the $ 80 range like many of the other persuasion books . this book should be considered a primer for everyone who wants to seriously persuade . get it , read it , use it , persuade , profit .
