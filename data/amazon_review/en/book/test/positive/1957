a three hundred page punctuation mark . this by far is the weaker book in the whole ender/bean saga , but this is n't due to card losing his stuff or anything quite that dramatic . the fact of the matter is that this is the last two hundred or so pages of book 6 . before the story could move anymore ( spoiler spoiler spoiler ) achilles had to be killed . i 'm guessing that adding that to the sixth book would have made it longer than the publisher liked , and thus what was probably one hundred pages of story had to be fleshed out , and thus diluted . i just finished reading book 8 and let me tell you that this was a wholly necessary step in the story . as for the lack of science fiction , i can admit that it is n't totally traditional sci-fi at this point , but it 's still got most of the characteristics . anything in the future , after alien bug invasions , with colony worlds , and faster than light communication , well yeah that counts as sci-fi to me . i think the biggest problem is that card is a total sci-fi guy , and when he tries his hand at romance it comes off like a bollywood movie . and the babies thing , the emphasis on having tons of babies , is a natural reaction of the characters to the end of the birth control laws . that probably explains why there seems to be an ongoing breeding infatuation . anyway , this book is good , but the others are great . but we need all in the series to make it work , so this one does it 's job well enough . it ca n't live up to the intrigue of the others , but it makes the eigth book possible . and the eigth was really worth it . at least we can be thankful that they have n't become as whacked out as the last two ender books
