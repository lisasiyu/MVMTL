a weighty tome alan f. segal 's book `` life after death '' is my first read of his work , and certainly the most massive book i have read in some time . considering the sheer scope of the topic segal has attempted to cover , the size of the book should come as no surprise . however , the physical weight is where the `` weightiness '' ends . now , before you freak out about over 700 pages of text on life after death , it should be emphasised that segal writes in a very accessible and easy going manner . a few of the words he uses require a dictionary , ( at least , i needed one ) , but the incidence of this was not a burden . segal keeps you moving and presents a great level of quotation from ancient sources to highlight his points . his manner and style of presentation and discussion are absolutely fantastic . segal presents the beliefs of different cultures from a more social viewpoint than anything , and deals with how these beliefs can illustrate what the people thought of about themselves and the world about them . what you end up with is a very interesting discussion not just on life after death , but also some of the political , cultural and social concerns that went into them . this makes for a very well-rounded discussion . segal takes you through various cultures and civilisations , and throughout he inter-connects various ideas between them to show how they illustrate each other by contrast or simularity . these cultures include chapters on ancient egypt , mesopotamia and canaan , israelite , ( broken into various chapters ) , and much more , including detailed chapters on christian views and their development through the centuries . this book is really a great overview of the topic , and it is relatively easy to find from segal 's referencing further material for more specific reading . segal has done exceptionally well to squeeze such a vast topic into about 750 well-written and dynamic pages . this book gets a big `` thumbs-up '' from me . i will certainly be reading more of segal 's work in the future
