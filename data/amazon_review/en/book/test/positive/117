the art of teaching old dogs new tricks how is it that the oakland a 's have won the al west in 2000 , 2002 , 2003 ( and are all but assured of winning this year , 2006 ) , as well as the wild card in 2001 , even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll ? that is the narrative that michael lewis uses to tell the story of his book moneyball . one of the central tenets of moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued , can , with some specificity , predict certain players ' performances in certain areas . it is , however , only half the story , and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you , old news . the real story that moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up . lewis repeatedly describes how the old boys club of major league owners ( who lewis affectionately refers to as the women 's auxiliary ) , players , and journalists ( former cincinnati red and current espn commentator joe morgan is appropriately skewered ) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like billy beane ( the book 's main protagonist and current a 's gm ) , bill james , dick cramer , and others . and on the old boys club the point is lost : that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who can not afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players , the best chance of winning . when people point to the fact that the a 's have not won the world series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years ( roughly since 1999 ) is when moneyball makes its point .
