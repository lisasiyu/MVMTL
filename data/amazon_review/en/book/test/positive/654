the `` spiritual path '' like it or not , we are all on a spiritual path , consciously or unconsciously ! our minds deem it `` difficult '' , but in truth , we are spirits having a human experience , not humans having a spiritual experience . with this in mind , this author 's book is a stellar , yet gentle , reminder to get out of our heads , and into our spiritual heritage . much of what he writes makes me do just that : `` oh yes , i know that , thank you for reminding me yet once again ! '' so much of this book resounds deeply in my heart . we all need this gentle reminding , no matter what stage we think we 've achieved on this journey . this book is written with light-hearted-ness that makes me smile , and pick up it up once again for pick-me-ups.keener jansse
