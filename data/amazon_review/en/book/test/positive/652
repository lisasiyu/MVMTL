a must read this is a tremendously informative and well written book . short and to the point and in a language that anybody can understand , it should be required reading for anyone vaguely interested in the economic future of america and , indeed , the whole world . mr. brown 's book is not a populist war cry but a sensible and well reasoned debunking of all the `` free trade '' rhetoric one normally hears . one warning : this book may well leave the reader angry with the status quo !
