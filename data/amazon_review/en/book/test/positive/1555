wonderful book this is a great telling of the story of ruby bridges , the first african american child to attend an all-white new orleans school . the book does a very good job of explaining on a child 's level , what ruby went through and why . the book was written by a child psychiatrist who witnessed her going into school and being shouted at by the angry mob and met with to allow her an outlet for her fears and feelings . do n't give too much credence to the reviewer who slammed the book because of the `` pointless '' religious scene . the mentions of religion are not pointless because faith is what helped ruby and her family through this difficult time ... faith in god was part of who they were . furthermore , although the book does n't directly go into gory details about the things that were said to and about ruby , it clearly explains that the whites did n't want their children in school with ruby and why . no book is going to answer all a child 's questions on any subject , but this one is a great way to open up the lines of communication and a great way to introduce the subject . an interesting side note : according to ruby bridges web site , mrs. henry , her beloved teacher , was not rehired by william franz elementary school the following year . one must assume that her loving care of ruby and her refusal to subscribe to the racist views made her unwelcome
