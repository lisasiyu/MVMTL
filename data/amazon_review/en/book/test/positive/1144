5-stars letter to a young gymnast is a excellant book . my coach recommended it to me , and after reading it , i gave it to my best friend to read . i was barely able to put it down . it is not so much a story of nadia comaneci 's career as a gymnast as a story of what life in romania was like . you walk away from this book feeling like you actually were there and know nadia comaneci personally . i rarely find biographies or autobiographies that are this good . defidently a 5-star book
