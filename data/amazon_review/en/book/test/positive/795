finally ! a simple solution ! one of the missing components to the concept of teaching `` social skills '' to children and young adults on the autism spectrum , is that instructors focus on textbook manners instead of teaching real life practical knowledge . the hidden curriculum explains that every society has unstated rules , the things that no one explains to you , but which you are supposed to pick up somehow on your own . remember how awkward and geeky most of us were in jr. high ? and there were always the `` cool kids '' who somehow knew just how to dress , just what to say and meanwhile you ( and i ) were clueless ? it 's because they understood the unstated rules , they had an unkanny ability to pick up the exact tools necessary for `` coolness . '' as we grow up , we learn better how to adapt to social situations , we know how to behave in a variety of settings , even perhaps cross culturally . adults grow into a sense of ease in our surroundings , we know what we are supposed to do . now , imagine that you never got over that awkward phase , you were perpetually spending your life roaming around trying to figure out the world with little to go on . no one pulled you aside and explained , `` this is how it is , kid . '' that 's exactly what it 's like for our kids on the spectrum . well , here comes the hidden curriculum to the rescue ! not only does it explain many of these `` unstated rules '' ( many of which are humorous -- who does n't know you should take tuna in your school lunch because it stinks ? many of our as kids ! ) it also goes beyond to explain how to uncover them . it highlights how crucial it is for us as parents , as educators and just as a society to literally pull our as folks aside and say , `` these are the rules . '' for example , `` do n't pick your nose . '' good advice right ? but p-leeeze , everybody picks their nose ! ( okay , not me , but everybody else ! : - ) what we really need to teach our kids is not , do n't pick your nose , but not to pick their nose where people can see them . sound silly ? our children and friends on the autism spectrum just need for us to teach them one little tidbit like this every day and they 'll find their way with increasing ease . and would n't you have liked someone to pull you aside in jr. high and done the same for you ? let 's equip our kids with the real skills to make their way in the world . the hidden curriculum does just that !
