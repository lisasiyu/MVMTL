lord jim : through many prisms darkly lord jim is the story of an ordinary man who commits what may or may not be an act of cowardice and spends the rest of his life trying to atone for his sin . what makes this story extraordinary is the difficulty the reader has assessing the nature of the original act and then judging whether jim has been punished enough . joseph conrad does not make it easy to gauge accurately either the man or his act since we can see the act filtered only through the lens of a narrator who is too close to the case to be judged reliable . lord jim is a novel of adventure and many read it on that basis , but lurking beneath the surface of a simple act is , as in so much of conrad 's fiction , a bewildering complexity of issues that tap into the deepest recesses of why people do what they do and how others can fairly judge them . marlow is the narrator who attends the trial of a crewman jim accused of abandoning his ship during a storm when he thought it was sinking . when all the ship 's officers leap into a lifeboat they abandon the more than eight hundred passengers below decks . jim joins them , and all are later picked up by a french trawler only to learn that their ship did not sink and in fact was safely towed to port . all the officers , except jim , escape punishment either by running away or pleading illness . only jim decides to speak out publicly in his defense , but of course there is none , so he is found guilty and stripped of his seaman 's certificate as punishment . marlow sees the trial and decides to follow jim around the world to get the truth . these are the bald facts , but what conrad does with them is to invest them with emotional and psychological issues that resist easy analysis . to begin with , conrad emphasizes jim 's ordinary state of being , by repeating that jim is `` one of us . '' this statement occurs so often that it becomes a mantra , inviting speculation as to what sense he is one of us . whoever the `` us '' is , conrad implies that the `` us '' must have had a standard of justice in which one size fits all . no one at the board of inquiry seems particularly upset that jim was merely following the captain 's orders to abandon ship nor that his record was otherwise flawless . the board judged jim by an inflexible code of honor and found him wanting . conrad , in his description of jim as a maritime everyman ( no first name , a flat character who no past , present , and now no future ) , makes it easy to condemn the board 's overhasty verdict to condemn jim for an act that had mitigating circumstances . as marlow gets to know jim , he acknowledges that the more he knows , the less he understands . conrad sets up a straw man in jim . because so many people , including marlow , hold jim under so many lenses , the images that result are often contradictory . the only constant is jim himself . during the trial , and later during the climactic encounter with the natives who call him lord jim , jim continues to attempt to see himself in the simplest manner possible . he knows that he can not possibly be all the jims floating on everyone 's lips , so he determines to be the jim who should have stayed on board the deck of a sinking ship . this jim is willing to take responsibility for his actions . when he unwisely allows the dastardly gentleman brown to escape his richly deserved fate , he makes a colossal leap of faith : he will pay now for all sins of his past . in his death , conrad suggests that this leap of faith may be the only trait that distinguishes reprobates like brown from ordinary men like jim who may not be so ordinary after all .
