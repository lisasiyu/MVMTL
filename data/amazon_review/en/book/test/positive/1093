mystery better than sex ? as far as i know , iris johansen has only written a few books in the mystery genre but numerous of the romance variety ( ok , so they may have been hot and steamy , but the mysteries have much better story lines ! ) . in my opinion , all of these mystery tomes are fantastic and i highly recommend each and every one of them ! if i had to pick a favorite one , i 'd be hard pressed , as each are unique and utterly captivating . i finished long after midnight and loved it ! was it better than ugly duckling or face of deception or the killing game or and then you die ? i ca n't make that decision but i can tell you that each one of these kept me intrigued until the very end . in long after midnight , kate denby a doctor of genetic research is an unwilling target for competitors who are willing to kill in order to stop the completion of a drug that will change the world . noah smith , of j and s pharmaceuticals , approached kate to go to work for him and refuses to take no for an answer . the opposition does n't know or care that she 's turned him down . when her ex-husband is killed in a car bombing right in front of her , not so soon after noah 's plant is blasted , she begins to suspect that something is wrong . this begins the story of her run in order to save not only her life , but also that of her young son , joshua . iris johansen throws in a few love entanglements with kate , noah and seth , noah 's best friend . seth has the responsibility of helping to keep them safe while noah and kate try to finish work on ru2 , the wonder drug of the future . this is enough to make a wonderful story , but johansen does n't stop there . she throws into the mix a diabolical creature named ishmaru who enjoys scalping his victims . kate defeats ishmaru once , but he 's on her trail and uses joshua 's safety to play head games with kate . when things seemed to level out to a steady rhythm , johansen hurled an obstacle to create another dimension - a realm i had n't even thought existed . i do n't think you 'll ever really figure out the entire plot and subplots included in this book until the very end . i thought i had everything worked out in my head and then bam - a major zigzag was added that gave even more depth to the tale . iris johansen has a unique style and you will always be thrown off by an unexpected twist in the book ( usually towards the end of it ) . this is what makes her mysteries more enticing than most writers - she 's always trying to keep the reader on his/her toes . this is definitely a `` stop light book '' and you 'll lose sleep trying to finish this one ! an absolute must for your summer reading list ! by the way , if you have n't read my definition of a stop light book , it 's in my review of ugly duckling by this same author .
