not completely my bowl of rice ... and yet i finished it in one sitting ! i will warmly recommend this book to my `` foreigner '' -friends who are willing to gain a better understanding of the filipino ways as well as to second-generation filipino kids who might just find this book helpful for understanding and perhaps appreciating their parents ' quirks . though i will need to caution them about some of the cultural/linguistic info here and there that is n't quite accurate . unfortunately - even though one might argue that the very existence of this book disproves my impression - i 'm mildly disappointed of how the protagonist , throughout the story , appears so eager to `` renounce the country of her birth '' . i feel that the book would not have been any less , had the epilogue been left out . besides , was there really a need for those david letterman 's top 10s o quasi ? the filipino society is avowingly matriarchal , mind you . so , to all of you `` westerners '' out there , better scratch that `` equality '' -part
