a dying world ? like the author i can remember the books i read as a child ( with great fondness ) , i have those books even today , and like her they are my old and familiar friends . but unlike her most of those books have been nonfiction , for i thought/think those were the way to see the real world . after reading this book i realize that the gap i thought existed between nonfiction and fiction is n't really important . for she sees books , like i imagine most readers do , as a funny kind of mirror which reflects the reader 's inner world at the same time as displaying the author 's world . i think the gap is between readers and nonreaders , who like those described this book as visual or picture people , identify with films rather than books . the book is a memoir which asks the big question on our reading minds -- does it matter if i ca n't remember what is in the books ? she answers it- `` for in the end , even if all my books where to vanish , i would still have them somewhere , if i had read them attentively enough . maybe the words on the page are not even the true book , in the end only a gateway to the book which recreates in the mind and lasts as long as we do . '' the book is a real treat for anyone who like her , is often asked , `` have n't you wasted your life , by reading rather than experiencing life ? '' she answers this with the thought that her life is so intertwined with the books she has read and thereby experienced , and so made a part of her . that it does n't matter , which is books and which is real life for they together make her , her . it 's a good book , short , poignant with echoes and parallels apparent to any readers life . go for it , spend a pleasant hour with this book
