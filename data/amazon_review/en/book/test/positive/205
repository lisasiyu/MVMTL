murder in mesa verde ... ill wind by nevada barr is the third book in her anna pigeon series , and the fourth book that i 've read . the more i read of barr , the more impressed i am with her mysteries . national park service ranger , anna pigeon , finds herself working in mesa verde national park , home of the anasazi ruins . this is a delicate assignment , trying to share the park with the public , while protecting the delicate ruins . when bad things start happening , one of the park employees claim it is the chindi ( or spirits ) of the anasazi , who are protesting the desecration of their sacred sites . each of these events is preceded by the appearance of a `` spirit veil '' over the ruins the night before . but when a fellow ranger is found dead under mysterious circumstances , the national park service calls in agent frederick stanton of the fbi . there are many theories as to what is happening in mesa verde . although unhappy spirits are not ruled out , the lack of truthfulness with almost everyone involved makes for lots of suspicious characters . pigeon and stanton work together to a thrilling conclusion . as with tony hillerman , i enjoy barr 's novels in that they teach the reader something new with each book . with ill wind , we not only learn more about the nps , but also , the mysterious anasazi and the ruins they left behind . it 's an unsolved mystery why this civilization lived here for 600 years , and then disappeared without a trace . we also learn more about ranger anna pigeon with each book . i would have given it five stars if it had n't dragged a bit at the beginning . still , i have already started reading another barr , flashback .
