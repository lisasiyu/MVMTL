my first jance this was my first jance novel . i enjoyed it immensely . i was surprised until the last page about `` who done it '' i learned some things about why people keep such large packs of pets . jance 's descriptions made me want to visit the desert . in conversation one evening to a person from the same area , i learned that her descriptions were indeed accurate . this wo n't be my last jance novel . hope the others are this good
