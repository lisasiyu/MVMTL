koontz continues to churn out hits year after year i wonder how koontz can continue to keep his writing fresh and entertaining . i worry that he will become like many other authors and become predictable and boring . happily- this has not happened to koontz . his last several books have only gotten better for me , i have a hard time putting them down ! life expectancy starts off with a very interesting premise : jimmy tock 's grandfather made a prediction on his deathbed the same day jimmy was born , listing 5 terrible days in jimmys future . thus , the book begins and we are along for the ride to see what each of these 5 days hold in store for him and his family . because the characters in this book are so enjoyable and loveable ( as most of koontz 's characters are ! ) i found myself in anticipation really hoping that these days would n't destroy them ... other stand out features of this book : not predictable at all- from start to finish . the ending was especially great in proving this point , as well as just great in general ! it was pretty fast-paced and kept the pages turning and did not leave me bored for a chapter . the uniqueness of the story as well as the quirkiness . lastly , to reiterate , the characters ! ! koontz really goes above and beyond most authors i read ( and i read a lot ) in creating not only fun , unique and loveable characters- but they are also very memorable ! it 's not often i can remember characters from a book in much detail , but koontz has such a gift that i can recall many , many of his characters and always find myself sad when their story ends . i think that is the sign of an exceptional writer
