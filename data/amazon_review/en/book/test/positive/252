flynn 's best effort so far this is the 5th book in the rapp series ( i 've read them in order ) , and it is definitely the best so far . the story is highly entertaining and action packed from the very beginning . flynn 's previous efforts , while still very good , have all left something to be desired . transfer of power was a little slower moving , third option and separation of power were too drawn out and should have been written as one novel , and executive power just was n't a terrific story . memorial day does not have any of these flaws . all the strengths of his previous efforts are present without any of the weaknesses . if you are an anti-military , excessively pc , or pro-bureaucracy , this sort of book is not for you . but if you are a fan of 24 , like one reviewer mentioned , you will be a big fan of the entire rapp series . i give it an easy five stars . ca n't wait to start consent to kill and act of treason
