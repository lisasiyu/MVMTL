living on the ragged edge-the simple life living on the ragged edge is a commentary on the old testament book of ecclesiastes . this was a life-changing book for me in 1986 . my whole life had literally collapsed right in front of my eyes . and i also had a nervous breakdown all in the pursuit of success and graduate school . this book seems to advocate living the `` simple life '' , knowing god , having a wife and kids , not overdoing work or success . i have received alot of abuse the past 20 years about why i do n't go back to graduate school ; and the wisdom of this book is part of the reason . i had written to radio havana cuba once and had said that this is a religious book that even fidel castro could appreciate ! i hear that since then he invited to pope to come to cuba to visit . we do live in an insane money-hungry society that has no values , no philosophy , no religion but the pursuit of the `` almight dollar '' ! this ia a major reaqon for why we see american society disintegrating right before out eyes ! it is not deliberate , but i think i see myself as living in the 60 's because of circumstances beyone my control . people in authority try to make my life as miserble as they can so as to pressure me into going back to college-this is called persecution . the amazing thing about our secular achievements is that when we die , we do not get any reward in heaven for them . both solomon in ecclesiastes and jesus christ in the new testament say that we get no reward in the next life for being a successful doctor , lawyer or businessman . jesus said to lay up treasure in heaven-good works like charity towards the poor . also i noticed that it is god who gives man the ability to enjoy life . and contrary to religious tradition in puritalical america , i have found on my electronic bible the advice to `` eat , drink and be merry '' { within moderation , of course . ) the phrase occured five times in ecclesiatstes . god gives the common man and the man who pleases him the ability to enjoy life . the life of the success driven rich man is so full of stress that he may have a fancy meal , yet he can not taste the food he is eating ! you can only live in one house at a time . you can only drive one car at a time . you can only spend so much money in this life because when you die , you wo n't have it any longer . you can have a house full of adult toys and possessions ; yet you are unable to enjoy any of them . i would focus on having a couple of things and being able to use them to the full . solomon spoke from experience . he was the richest man in ancient israel as he was the king . he had all the education a man could want . he had sexual pleasure-a harem of 500 wives like the sultan of brunei . he had more horses that he could ride . he had more achievement than he knew what to do with . yet he could n't find satisfaction . his advice was to fear god , obey his commandments and enjoy the simple pleasure of life . he found out that sometimes more is less . in an exotic fashion , i had found out about insight for living while monitoring trans world radio broadcasting from the island monaco to england in 1986 . they sent me a magazine promoting the book . i bought it and the study guilde and used them both . i have read living on the ragged edge three times since them . this is obviously a message that god wants me to get into my spirit . and this is actually good advice for all of materialistic , worldly america ! another afterthought is this . i do n't think that joining the army is the place to go to find god . but i had managed to get away from my home , family , church and social influences in toledo . i read the bible independantly and did not often attend church . i had found ecclesiastes in the old testament ; yet the message seemed to offend and irritate me at age 17 . i think that you may have to go through a few things in life , have a few misfortunes and find a need to look to god for answers in the bible to really appreciate this book and ecclesiastes ! ecclesiastes is a book of godly philosphy ! philosophy=the study of wisdom !
