an intellectually stimulating treatise on african american men and their auras scott poulson-bryant is a bright young artist with heady credentials and a true gift for creative thinking and well-crafted writing skills . he joins the growing ranks of young african american strong writers such as e.l. ayala , e. lynn harris , keith boykin , j.l . king , caesar brunswick , christopher david , and stanley bennett clay who not only address issues heretofore considered taboo in the black community , but succeed not only as brave new voices but also as gifted , important writers . hung : a meditation on the measure of black men in america starts out with a terrific cover , promises revelation of secrets everyone wants to know , addresses his reader with pertinent facts , and then progresses to relax and offer a rather personalized memoir of his experiences as a black man in america , a man who knows the myths and the realities about phallic secrets , and shares his own insights as well as those of gentlemanly unnamed confidents from whom he gathers his facts . along the way poulson-bryant not only discusses phallus size , but he also explores the mystique of black men who model for books ( mapplethorpe is a frequent reference point ) , the porn industry , the world of athletes ( yes , naming names ) , the rap world , and the executive world . but he does n't limit his meditation to experiences interviewing men : poulson-bryant wisely includes women in his foray of questioning the importance of size as a feature of desirability vs. myth vs. disadvantage . it is a well-rounded book and one that never lets the interest lag . but what one comes away with from this book is an appreciation of the exceptional style of writing of scott poulson-bryant . he is a writer of charm , of humor , of wit , and of intelligence . this reader would like to see how he performs in the field of fiction : in reportage he is up there with the best ! grady harp , october 06
