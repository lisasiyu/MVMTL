detailed , interesting and fun how-to book ! ! this book is not only an interesting read , but fun as well ! the pictures detail everything from each step of refurbishing a sailboat , including what tools to use and how to use them . i just ordered 3 more copies and ca n't wait to give them to my boating enthusiastic friends ! whether your re-doing a sailboat or not , i would highly recommend this to anybody who 's into boating .
