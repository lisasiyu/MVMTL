one whacked witch witch is a riveting read about a woman who undoubtedly killed at least two people - her mother and her former husband . she was never charged in the death of her ex , and she skated several years until the stench from a storage shed where she stashed the body of her mother put authorities on her trail . puit does a nice job of tracing the steps of brookey lee west , a tech writer/marble reader ( she claims she can read the future using marbles ) /daughter of a satan worshipper . witch was a quick read - i usually take my time with books , but this tale was compelling enough that i hardly put it down . it is somewhat gorey in spots , but well worth reading if true crime is your thing
