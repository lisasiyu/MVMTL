a very good biography of a unique person i 've been a fan of w.c. fields since my youth . there was always something about him , a certain style that he had on screen , that was unique . this book does tell the truth behind the real w.c. , and dispells many of the myths that still are current about him . he was a man that was in turn cantankerous , gentle , funny and poignant . i for one never realized that he was such an avid reader . books seemed to be his passion , and all during his world travels as a vaudeville juggler he carried trunks of books along the way . anyone that reads so voraciously is bound to be an interesting personality . his vast reading no doubt contributed to his comedy that involved the word play for which he is famous . it is astounding to know that for many years in the early part of his career when he was a juggler , that he did his act in almost total silence ! a great biography that reveals the unique character that was w.c. fields . written in a very readable style , we can learn about this man , warts and all through this book . highly recommended
