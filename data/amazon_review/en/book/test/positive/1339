shades of gray this was an interesting and fun book . the good guys are a little bad and the bad guys are a little good , although there are some really bad ones . reminiscient of the nightside books by simon green , but still totally different . inspector chen is a good guy who does the best he can , and still ca n't keep from getting involved with demons . holds your interest from the first , and keeps you turning those pages . i liked the short chapters , and the overall format of the book . the artwork on the cover is gorgeous . i 'm definitely reading the rest of this series . this was the first liz williams book i have read , and i plan to look into her others
