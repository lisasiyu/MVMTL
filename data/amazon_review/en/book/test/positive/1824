nothing new , but a good refresher ziegler certainly gives an inside look into the business , but for me , having been to two joe verde seminars , it came as nothing new . for someone new to the business , i 'd certainly recommened it . for someone with several years in the business , it 'd still be a very good refresher course . it 's all too easy to get into a `` rut '' , and this book can help you see where your mistakes are possibly being made , so that you can correct them . it would also be a good read for a car buyer , as it would give them a lot of insight into how some dealerships conduct business .
