better than barron's whether you 've already used up the previous two spanish guides in the practice makes perfect series ( spanish verb tenses , and spanish pronouns and pronouns ) , or this is your introduction , this workbook is as good as it gets for the intermediate to advanced student of spanish who wants to keep learning beyond the classroom . complete spanish grammar has it all -- friendly , down-to-earth language , exercises that could have been taken right out of hispanic shops and streets and living rooms , and explanations of grammar components that actually make sense . i do n't know how many times i 've heard the exact phrases i just saw in the workbook while walking down the streets of mexican towns . and since it 's soft-cover , it 's easy to take with you and work with while traveling . hey , at $ 10.95 , you can even afford to buy and extra one to keep in the car .
