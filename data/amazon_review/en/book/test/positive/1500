the definitive magic flute i 'm usually dismissive of most die zauberflotes because i find the overall quality of the singers and recording lacking . then i came upon this recording ... i have to say that it is simply the most amazing die zauberflote i 've ever heard ! the orchestrations to the singers to the conductor himself ... everything is mind-blowing ! i 'm not a mozart person , but if i really like a recording of his i will buy it . this is an excellent way to introduce yourself to the flute , especially since there is such a wonderful introduction accompanying this extremely famous opera . and the queen of the night-edda moser ! ! ! amazing ! simply amazing ! no other queen has conveyed that much drama into her singing . this is the flute . i would suggest marriner 's version if i had n't seen this one , but then here is a flute with all the greats in it ! get it now
