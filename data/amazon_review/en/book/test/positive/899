misunderstanding nobody seems to realize the personal element in this book.her insinuations of violence as revenge are rhetorical and come from millenia of do i even need to say it ? it 's not like she is speaking on behalf of the movement but in behalf/against the years . nobody 's going to puncture your larynx with a stiletto , alright ? i suggest those who think a woman expressing her rage in a violent manner for justifiable reasons to be so taboo read henry miller 's black spring.perhaps more to your taste
