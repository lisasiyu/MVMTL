get off the beaten path be sure to look for the newer edition ( 2003 ) as it covers 70 small towns . i started out thinking i would just dip into this , and read a few pages here and there . then it turned out to be so interesting with florida history , local tidbits , interesting people and architecture , that i read it straight through . now i ca n't wait to visit havana to see the antique shops or to see the 36 murals in lake placid . some of the towns merely have interesting names ( yeehaw junction ) or a single sight , but many sound worthwhile for a day trip or longer visit . probably should keep this book in the car while in florida and check it occasionally to see if you are near any of these interesting places . it is arranged by regions ( north , central and south )
