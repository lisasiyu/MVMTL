for the most part , very good : ) i liked the story line a lot , the only thing i did not like was that the author -repeatedly- had to say what a perfect body the main character had . lol . i mean after the sixth time.. we got it ! lol.. definitely a guy and definitely fantasizing when he wrote it i 'm guessing.. perfectly toned , perfect everywhere else . good , now move on ! : ) other than that , i really liked the description of what the `` bad guy '' mechanisms were . too bad i ca n't use those kinds of disguises in real life . very interesting : ) i 'd still recommend the book :
