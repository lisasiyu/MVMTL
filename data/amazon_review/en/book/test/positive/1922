book for all to read avorn 's beautifully written book seems to become more important for `` the rest of us '' with every breaking news story about the pharmecutical industry . my suggestion in the light of the vioxx disaster ? if you are interested in your own health and the medicines we take so casually , then buy a copy of this beautifully written and oh so revealing book . let me give you a flavor of just how good a writer avorn he and how revealing this book is by quoting the way he introduces a chapter from this book : `` in a former british colony , most healers believed the conventional wisdom that a distillation of fluids extracted from the urine of horses , if dried to a powder and fed to aging women , could act as a general tonic , preserve youth , and ward off a variety of diseases . the preparation became enormously popular throughout the culture , and was used widely by older women in all strata of society . many years later modern scientific studies revealed that long-term ingestion of the horse-urine extract was useless for most of its intended purposes , and that it caused tumors , blood clots , heart disease , and perhaps brain damage . '' this ( sad ) `` fairy tale '' introduces the whole sorry tale of hormone replacement therapy for women , and how badly the research was to defend it . the book just gets better from here
