wonderful handbook i 'm new at reading about energy healing modalities , so i have little to compare it to . i found this book to be a really nice book to learn more about healing touch and how to be a practitioner . it has some wonderful stories , some that even made me cry . i still have a long way to go to make this work for me , but it 's the beginning of a new awareness in my life
