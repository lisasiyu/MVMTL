the life of a meadow mr. galvan 's writing about a piece of property , at first , seems strange ; however , as you read you become absorbed . he writes of much more than the land , he writes of the people who live that land . it takes a special person to live in the wilds of wyoming , and an extrodinary person to live in the isolated , rugged , raw , and unforgiving areas . this is a book i have given as a gift to many individuals who know what it is truly like to live here in wyoming , want to live here , or seem to possess that independence and creativity needed to live here
