`` this excitement has put us behind in our drinking . '' what a difference three years can make . between 1930 ( when hammett finished `` the glass key , '' perhaps his bleakest work ) and 1933 ( when he published `` the thin man , '' his last novel ) , hammett had discovered two things that transformed his outlook on life : a steady income from book sales and from hollywood filmwriting and , perhaps more important , lillian hellman . there 's surely nothing like being unexpectedly wealthy and suddenly in love : hammett 's changed outlook on life is even more apparent when one compares the 65-page outline of `` the thin man '' he set aside in 1931 with the final version of his book , which seems to be more of a light-hearted and satirical tribute to the traditional whodunit than a continuation of the gloomy noir of his earlier novels . while his first four novels , as well as the early draft , featured an anti-establishment loner ( the continental op , sam spade , ned beaumont ) , `` the thin man '' introduces nick and nora charles as a pair of unlikely crime-busters breaking off their vacation in new york ( which consists mostly of drinking at any available venue ) to solve a murder . readers with only a passing knowledge of hammett 's biography will recognize both hammett and hellman as the inspirations for the alcoholic ex-sleuth and his socially savvy wife . what also separates `` the thin man '' from hammett 's other full-length works is its giddy humor , which revolves around seedy nightlife , early-morning alcohol consumption , and nick and nora 's freethinking rapport , while the dialogue pokes fun at the tough-guy image and the mystery form itself . the morning after being grazed by a bullet , nora asks nick : `` how do you feel ? '' `` terrible , i must 've gone to bed sober . '' this playful banter takes up much of the book and supplies one of its greatest pleasures . many hammett fans have long regarded `` the thin man '' as his weakest novel , and i tend to agree -- up to a point . this book lacks the quality for which the others are famous : uniqueness ( for lack of a better word ) . although it 's a sophisticated manhattan comedy , hammett 's last detective novel is a lot like many other whodunits , and his unexpectedly relaxed and newly satisfied voice often does n't ring true . even so , it 's a shining example of the traditional mystery and a lot of fun to read
