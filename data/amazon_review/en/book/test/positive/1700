very enjoyable with an important message this will appeal to many people , from history buffs to health professionals and those of us who also love a good story . myself , i always enjoy the human behavior aspect to how things came to be in our society , and the story of vaccination is terrific . aside from the fun aspect of this book , mr. allen manages to write compassionately about the real people who have believed that their children 's autism was caused by vaccines . there has been so much propaganda and spurious argumentation around this issue ( particularly by people like don imus -- he should be ashamed of himself ) , which has unfortunately lead many parents of children with autism to believe that vaccination caused their child 's disability . i hope very much that mr. allen 's work will help shine the light of reason on that sad situation
