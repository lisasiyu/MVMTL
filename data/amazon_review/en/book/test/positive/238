passionate and thoughtful subtitled `` a scientist 's search for common ground between god and evolution , '' this book is a thoughtful and serious attempt to resolve the question of whether a sincere christian ( or adherent of any other western religion , which is his main focus ) can also accept darwinian evolution . in the first chapter , miller recounts his religious catholic upbringing , his introduction to darwin ( dogged by warnings that he was reading a `` dangerous '' book ) , and his later decision to enter the field of biology . the next part of the book looks at the development of the scientific method and the theory of evolution , as well as painstakingly and devastatingly refuting the three major schools of opposition to it . he shows that the proponents of these `` alternatives '' misunderstand and distort science , continue using obsolete arguments long after they are debunked , and make no effort to do scientific research of their own while demanding that their ideas be accepted as science . he also argues that they present profoundly flawed pictures of god , as evidenced by his chapter titles : `` god the charlatan , '' `` god the magician , '' and `` god the mechanic . '' miller also tackles head-on the most legitimate beef of the anti-evolutionists , the use of `` darwinism '' by many scientists to attack religion and to claim that if nature can be explained and understood , god is proven not to exist or life proven to be purposeless . he feels that it is as wrong to make these claims as it is to attempt to use science to `` prove '' that god does exist . the final third of the book is devoted to a passionate and well thought out case that acceptance of the truth of evolution is not only not a bar to a sincere and committed religious outlook , but can be , in conjunction with other areas of science , an affirmation of it . i wo n't try to summarize or do justice to his argument here , but i believe that many who are more traditional than i am will find it convincing . i do n't think that miller will convert any atheists to his point of view , but that is not his purpose . what he is doing is reaching out to believers and offering them a place at the table instead of antagonizing them and pushing them away , without compromising his scientific integrity . his obvious enthusiasm for science and love of god make him a perfect person to do this , and given that people are most belligerent when they feel that their core beliefs are being threatened , it seems to me to be a very sensible course to follow
