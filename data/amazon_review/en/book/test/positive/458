mr. fitzhugh is one of a kind ! if you 're looking for the outrageous , eccentric , with a laugh in at least every paragraph , you just ca n't beat bill fitzhugh ! plus , his books are great satires on contempary america . cross dressing is perhaps his most realistic , with no sci- fi overtones such as those found in pest control , an even wilder ride ! here we have a socially aware nun with an unusual past , meeting up with an ad huckster in some of the funniest scenes ever written , yet everything here is certainly very possible , if not likely . his barbs at organized religion , and the huckster consumer society are all too real ! truly , mr fitzhugh strikes a solid punch , and one wishes for more success for this unique , zanily- inspired author
