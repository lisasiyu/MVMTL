wonderful premise handled with great skill i can not claim to know much about philip k. dick as this is , thus far , the only one of his novels i have read . but based on a reading of the game-players of titan , it will not be the last . the premise of the inhabitants of earth playing the game , bluff , for spouses and land is wonderful and the story only grows weirder and more original with each passing chapter . the only small quibble is the ending is somewhat anti-climatic after the strongly built , witty , creatively heightened build up but this book is about the journey and one could have no better guide than the author for this unique trip
