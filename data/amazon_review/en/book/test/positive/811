great story in context this is a great story in context - the year is 2002 , the author is switching from being a hedge fund manager to a full-time journalist and tv prognosticator . he 's a branding machine , so the book contains a lot of self-promotion . you see jim the hyper , jim the genius and jim the buffoon - all part of the brand . the biography takes you from jim at harvard , to jim the homeless journalist to jim the financier to jim the hedge fund operator . jim fesses up to a lot of the personal problems that he caused for himself along the way , writing in the same style he rants on tv . as such , the story carries the same fast pace as the tv . even if you do n't like him , you 'll keep reading . is this a book on how to make $ in the stock market ? not really - there are much better out there . is this the definitive biography on cramer ? that probably wo n't be written until after his lact act . will this help you understand the guy sweating , screaming and pulling his hair out in the lightning round ? absolutely
