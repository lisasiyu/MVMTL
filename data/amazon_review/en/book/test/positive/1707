fun way to learn about maps this book is classic dr. seuss ... fun , silly , and children do n't realize they 're learning something . great book for teaching about maps . i bought this for my 6 year old prior to going on vacation . we had been looking at maps and talking about what states we 'd be driving through on our trip . he enjoyed listening to the book and because of the way the information is presented ( fun and silly rhymes ) , he has retained what he learned . he has even referred back to specific bits of information we read from the book ( i.e . never eat shredded wheat to remember north , east , south and west . ) the back of the book contains a glossary of terms mentioned in the book . highly recommended as an additional tool for teaching about maps
