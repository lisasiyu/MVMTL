it works for me i bought this book in august , 2006 . at that time , my ra symptoms had me walking with a cane and unable to do any exercise other than very gentle water calisthenics . fast forward 3 months , and i feel better than i did before i got sick . i now work out on an elliptical trainer , practice yoga , or take a pilates class 6 days a week . neighbors who hardly know me comment on the improvement in my mobility ( i guess a 30 yo woman with a cane is pretty noticeable . ) i 've also lost 22 pounds . i know what the arthritis foundation and the rheumatologists say about ra and nutrition and i do n't believe them anymore . i ca n't promise it will work for everyone , but if you have ra , please at least try the guidelines in this book . you owe it to yourself to do whatever it takes to get better . only four stars because the text could be better organized
