sidetracked home executives : from pigpen to paradise i bought this book in 1981 and lent it to my sister-in-law who promptly lost it . when my daughter asked me for help to organize her housekeeping , i looked for this book . i like this book because it is an easy organized system that kept me on track with daily , weekly , monthly , and yearly tasks
