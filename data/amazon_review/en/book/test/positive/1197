the first and the best biography i was quite surprised to see a biography of james tiptree , jr. at all , let alone such a magnificent one . ms. phillips has done an amazing job at bringing both the woman and the writer into clear focus . i ca n't imagine that any details of tiptree/sheldon 's life are not captured here . certainly a must read for true sci-fi fans and well as those curious about the history of women 's role in our society . this bio will win several awards , no doubt about it . quite simply all you could ask for in one volume
