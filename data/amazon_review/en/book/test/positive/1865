common sense amid chaos i heard dr. wood speak in washington before i purchased the book and he is as eloquent in person as he is on the page . it is difficult to discuss this matter in the public square given the emotional sensitivities in our society when one tries to talk about race , and no doubt many on the left will dismiss dr. wood out of hand . but he gives a reasoned , thoughtful discussion on an issue that is still very central in our lives and society - but as dr. wood points out , if the left were n't so focused on & quot ; diversity & quot ; we would likely be much closer to the colorblind society we all seek . an excellent and timely read
