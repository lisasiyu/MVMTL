an extrodinary year for shakespeare this is one of the best books i have read dealing with shakespeare . becuase it has such a specific focus , the year 1599 , it is able to take an indepth look at some of shakespeare 's best work . the book focuses on some of shakespeare 's best plays : julius ceaser , as you like it , and hamlet , but unlike so many other shakesperian analysis he does not look at this only from a literary standpoint shapirio looks at it from a historical view . shapirio chronicles the events in shakespeare 's life and in local and global politics that would effect what he was writting in a particular year . this specificity of this topic allows shapirio to fully engage the reader in intresting and unique analysis of very well known plays . though this book is detailed and very focused it is by no means dull . this book is engaging and witty throughout . i would strongly reccomend this to anyone intrested shakespeare or the elizabethan era .
