in love in italy hazzard is an elegant , intelligent writer , and great fire is one of the finest novels in recent memory , but i was a bit disappointed by evening of the holiday , a slim novel which tells the summer love affair of a british traveler with an italian landowner . hazzard has great insight into human nature in general and culutral identity as well , and her lyrical descriptions of the italian countryside are lovely . however , the story here never quite engages ; the love affair is doomed from the start , we are assured , and hazzard ca n't quite keep us enthralled , as she usually does , although , as in all hazzard 's work , there are stunning moments of insight and clarity , and one is astounded how easily she can throw off an aphorism
