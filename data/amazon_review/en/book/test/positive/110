best book i 've ever read ! this book has no doubt been the best book i 've ever read . i credit this book with saving my marriage . my husband and i had filed for divorce ( all we had to do was sign the bottom line ) and decided to give it one last chance . my mother sent us to a marriage conference featuring dr. chapman and his book . after the conference , i just had to buy the book and i read it through almost non-stop . the principles found in this book are not just applicable to marriage but carry over into every other relationship in your life . awesome !
