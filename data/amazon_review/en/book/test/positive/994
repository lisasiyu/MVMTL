incredibly good writing this is an amazing , beautifully written first novel . not only is the plot first rate , the characters are drawn with a rare degree of perception and even compassion . the relationships are realistic and change as the investigation proceeds and when the murderer is caught . the dialogue is natural , and reflects the personality of the character speaking . there is also wonderful humor in the descriptions and the dialogue . this is the mystery to lend the friends who think mysteries are shallow , formulaic and generally not worth wasting time on . this is the book to lend to friends who love good writing . i ca n't wait for the next
