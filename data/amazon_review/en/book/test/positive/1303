fabulous illustrations ... my 4 year old son and i stumbled across this book in the library and i immediately knew we had to have our own copy . the poem that constitutes the text of this book is simple and timeless . the illustrations are breathtaking . each painting depicts the same train at the crossing , the various townspeople waiting at the crossing and the contents of the freight cars . my son loves inventing 'conversations ' between the people waiting for the train to pass . a lovely book that is a nice addition to any child 's library
