funny what logic can do . oswald allis was a champion of biblical interpretation of the `` end-times '' and of the role of the church in the 1930 's . he shows very clearly the distortions of the bible that modern dispensationalists and the authors of the `` left behind '' books take for granted . as an example of the impact of this book , i gave it to a confirmed dispensationalist in the mid-80 's and asked her to read it and then discuss it with me . she read half of it and gave it back to me and refused to discuss it . invincible ignorance had set in , refusing to even discuss the passages of scripture that did not fit her scofield-induced template of escatology . the 1945 preface is prophetic : `` is their [ the jews ] presence 'in the land ' so important that palestine should be regarded as belonging to them exclusively , and should they be encouraged to set up a kingdom there like that of david or solomon ? should the christians in all the allied countries use every effort to persuade their governments to insist at the coming peace conference that palestine be given to the jews ? is this the solution to the jewish question ? or , is the reason that the jew is a problem to be found in something quite different : in the fact that he rejected the messiah promised to his race and was 'scattered among the nations ' as a punishment for his sin , that he still continues in unbelief and yet still regards himself as a 'peculiar people , ' whose destiny is to rule the earth under a messiah who is yet to come ? ... or , is his need , his supreme need , that heavenly salvation which is to be found only in the christian church ? '' another way of asking this is , did the jew 's presence `` in the land '' usher in peace and harmony for the jews ? or for anyone ? read the headlines of today 's papers and one can see that this whole enterprise was and is folly , and yet christians still wear their dispensational blinders , and it is staggering to behold . if you 'd like to know more about the end-times , israel and the church , read this book with your bible open . those who do so will have their thinking challenged and appreciation of the scriptures increased . but i warn you -- it does n't fit the current evangelical mindset and may make you feel uncomfortable with the multitude of `` bible-teachers '' who ca n't deal with the facts of scripture
