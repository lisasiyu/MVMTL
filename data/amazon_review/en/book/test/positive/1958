a story to be remembered ok when i first read this book i was 9 years old and after the first time i found it my local library i was never able to find it again because i forgot the title and the author but i never forgot the story or the beautiful artwork . now that i 'm 19 and there 's now the internet to use , i 'm happy to have found this book again ! i 've been looking for this book for 10 years , it is worth the search and will be memorable to any child who reads it . ^_^
