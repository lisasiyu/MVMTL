`` physician , heal thyself '' the nazi doctor and the holocaust in this detailed and well-researched account , psychologist robert j. lifton chronicles the holocaust from a unique perspective : the role played by nazi medical doctors . in doing so he explains the nazi philosophy that formed the basis for mass murder : the necessity to heal the ills of german society by eliminating all its corrupting influences . healing was and is the raison d'etre for the medical profession . doctors were thus compelled to become killers in the application of this all encompassing `` cure . '' lifton traces the evolution of the holocaust beginning with the `` euthanasia '' projects of the 30 's . anyone incapable of being a productive member of society was consided , `` life unworthy of life '' and euthanized . initially this was confined to the mentally challenged and the old/infirmed . later even severely wounded german soldiers were not spared . execution technology perfected here formed the basis for the mass executions conducted later . lifton interviews many physicians in this work including some former nazi 's and many jewish doctors forced to work at auschwitz . here , the inner conflicts of persons trained to heal but actively involved in killing reached its apex . reactions varied from the cold , view of inmates as `` laboratory rats '' and nothing more by josef mengele , to the tortured acceptance of the necessity of doing his duty of eduard wirths . coping mechanisms included sending others to do the `` dirty work '' when possible , excessive use of alcohol , and in some cases , suicide . still , the work went on , despite any internal contradictions . this is the first work i have seen that explained the nazi philosophy and its impact on the holocaust . because it was the stated goal of national socialism to cleanse german society of all its ills , the participation of healers was essential . the nazi 's never wavered in this twisted belief . would the holocaust have occurred without the doctor 's participation ? undoubtedly , yes ! however doe 's this excuse their participation ? you the reader must decide . a great read . five stars ! ! harold y. grooms
