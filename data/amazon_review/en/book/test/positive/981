first a lot of character exploration in this collection . a lot of the x-men being the young people they are have started to couple up . there are also some breaks with colossus and nightcrawler having problems after colossus has come out . the major storyling is the phoenix . is jean grey the phoenix ? i ca n't say without spoiling it , but it does not follow the path of the traditional marvel universe . overall it was a good story , the artwork is a but uneven at times , but it works for the most part
