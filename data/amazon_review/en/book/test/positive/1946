classic collection of ducktales as a collector , i love the quality presentation of this set of 5 stories . as a fan of the ducks , i just love the stories , and the superb art work . i was kind of sure that i had seen the cover art under another name , something like the `` duck family album '' but thats not too significant , since the art-work presents the characters from inside the set of stories . probably the best thing in the structure of the stories is the way each layer flows into continuous action . `` mocking bird ridge '' shows classic donald , the wily gladstone gander , the nephews , all pitted against the ever money-wise uncle scrooge . of course , few are the times that scrooge loses out ( since , as everyone knows , his lucky `` number one '' , takes care of his money skills ) .it 's a classic setup , with a wonderful denoument . `` a sticky situation '' ; i must admit to having no immediate memory of this great story . the nieces look like they are early on in their design phase , but appear to be a parallel to the nephews . the only similar story i was aware of is a diary narrative , same as this story , done as an animated valentines day special . it 's massive fun , and shows daisy and the nieces in full form , with daisy 's come-uppance against donald being perfect poetic justice . the `` grandma duck '' story is a great venue down on the farm , with gus goose being the prime mover , as always , by almost total accident . it 's a great story with a totally sweet , but not saccharine , ending . `` jonah gyro '' : this is a variation on a theme that gyro has done at other times , but the fishing technology he develops not only has the other fishermen jealous and angry , but provides for a hilarious series of events for the masterful gyro , who proves that if he can , he will , and you will be entertained by it ! ! ! `` go slowly sands of time '' : absolutely superb in every way . a brilliant story that has the ducks cross the world , and only to discover that they had the secret right at home ; as ever , the fun is in the journey , and this is another part of a great set . the paper is first rate . the binding is great , and the quality in all respects is tops . a great buy for anyone who wants to keep this material for a long time ... another great reprint of the gladstone title .
