best of ludlum ! while reading ludlum in between more artistic works of literature , i like to follow a good spy/action novel . ludlum provides ! bourne identity really provides ! it went through all things a good ludlum novel ought to go through : action packed , twisting plots , romance , conspiracy , character thoughts , and , unfortunately , repetition . five of those six are gems , but the repetition wore me out nearing the end . i can only read `` charlie is for delta ; delta is for cain '' ( or something like that ) so many times ... then i have to cringe , bite my lip and suppress an urge to scream at the annoyance . if you could have someone black-out all these lines in the book before you read it , it would make the read so much more enjoyable
