chilling whether or not astrology can help to predict events , this book gives many examples of how astrology has been used by people throughout a very long history . although mention is made of a time when common folk , such as those attending the theater , understood astrological portents as a part of everyday life , the book emphasizes how famous and highly-intelligent people made use of astrology for worldwide matters , as well as for practical , personal application such as the time of death ( even though some , given the knowledge , tried and failed to change the event ) . choosing to elevate the traditional approach over the modern , psychological method is debatable , but the traditional progression in the book from hitler to bush is quite chilling . well worth the read
