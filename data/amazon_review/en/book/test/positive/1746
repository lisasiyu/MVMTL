do n't look thru human eyes i wanted to throw out a comment to the lengthy review blasting elena and clay 's relationship . i loved this book , not only because kelley armstrong does n't waste time with characters that run around wringing their hands and whining about how 'cursed ' they are . too many authors in this genre waste time with this kind of nonsense . the whole `` i 'm not human therefore i 'm damned '' thing . if you read kelley 's e-novella about clay and elena 's first meeting , you see very clearly that elena actually had a great deal in common with clay before she was changed . i think that was what drew him to her . no , his actions later on were n't very noble , but i think when you understand that he does n't think like a human , then you understand him better . also , this book does a good job of introducing the three way relationship between clay-elena-jeremy . the fact that the main characters are not alpha wolves , but betas ( the followers of the pack ) really is a nice touch . i love this story , it 's one of my favorites . i like the fact that kelley armstrong went outside of the box to inject something a little different into her wolves . to many authors are lazy with their subjects . she 's the real deal
