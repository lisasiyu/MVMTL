another good one bosch is back and finally diving into his mother 's murder case while he 's been place on involuntary leave . our favorite detective is put through the ringer and has to come face to face with some rather ulgy demons from his past . one girlfriend hits the road and another is quickly picked up on the rebound . for a workaholic , bosch gets around . this time , however , our rebound chick has some baggage -- then again-so did our last girlfriend . her husband was a psycho-cop . so maybe he just attracts women with serious baggage . though this was another multi-layered and complex case , i was able to figure out the real killer pretty early . but with connelly , the journey is just as intriguing as the destination
