best trilogy since `` lord of the rings '' steve schirripa 's `` the goomba diet '' does for italian cuisine what `` the da vinci code '' does for catholicism -- the only difference is that once the pope reads schirripa 's book , he 's going to make steve an official saint . following in the tradition of his previous literary masterpieces , ( `` the goomba 's guide to life '' and `` the goomba 's guide to love '' ) schirripa has accomplished the impossible by writing a book that 's even funnier than his first two . whether you 're italian or jewish , fat or thin , heterosexual or a fanook , `` the goomba diet '' delivers a powerful message from which the world can benefit . and by `` the world '' , i mean overweight italian criminals indicted under the rico statute who enjoy penne arrabiata . not only is `` the goomba diet '' superior to any book currrently on the new york times bestseller list , but it proves why steve schirripa deserves to host his own late night network television talk show -- he 's far more talented than jimmy kimmel , carson daly , and or that annoying scottish guy on cbs . and if boring idiots like `` jerry r. from montreal '' like this book , then it can be enjoyed by everyone .
