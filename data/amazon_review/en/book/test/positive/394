an exciting modern classic i picked this book up not knowing what it was about , just knowing that it had won the pulitzer . i have now read it twice ; the first time i read it i thought very highly of it , but the second time i read it i not only looked at it as one of the greatest american classics of our time but i looked at it as a fun , early 1900 's , college book . one part of the book i exspecially liked was when martin confesed to both of his girlfriends that he was engaged to both of them at the same time ! i love it ! sinclair lewis was so ahead of his time with that episode ! this is lewis ' finest work , a homage to the art of medicine and the spirit of a young man searching for himself and his career . a must have book
