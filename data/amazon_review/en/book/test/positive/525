simply a must read ! i read this book such a long time ago , and i purchased it for my son to read also . this book was the one that made me and advid reader and it is so important for every young adult to read it whether african american or other nationality . it is simply good journalism ! you can really feel where the author is trying to go with his dialogue . it puts peer pressure , city life , drugs , right in the faces of the young adult . it also helps young adults find a solution to an everyday problem . a great gift for any reader . this is something to keep in your library for all times
