a great tour of modern transport systems john mcphee rides with a cross-country trucker who hauls chemicals ; takes a course in piloting ocean going vessels ; navigates the illinois river with a thousand foot string of barges ; describes how a million packages a night are sorted and shipped from a ups facility and rides in the cab of a mile long train hauling coal . his descriptions are full , informative and never , ever boring ( except once when he describes a canoe trip , but that chapter is easily skipped ) . there is a very slight hint of condescension in mcphee 's narrative ; he is always at pains to remind the reader how little formal education his subjects have . perhaps this is something ingrained from his new yorker writing . fortunately this habit is neither overly intrusive nor obnoxious . his descriptions of each of his adventures ( other than the canoe trip ) are wonderfully informative . his sense of awe at ups 's massive and incredibly complex sorting facility comes through to the reader along with a marvelously detailed description of how the of miles and miles of conveyors and automated tools acting with very little human intervention move more than a million packages a night . mcphee made me wish i could join a tow boat captain as he maneuvers a thousand foot line of barges up and down a narrow river . or sit in the cab of a locomotive as it loads up more than a hundred cars with tons of call , a train more than a mile long that can be ascending one side of a grade while descending the other . overall it 's quite a set of adventures and one well worth reading . jerr
