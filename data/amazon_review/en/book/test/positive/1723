fine piece of literature grand hotel , the translation of menchen im hotel , is about a group of strangers staying at a posh hotel in berlin . each of them have their troubles and become connected throughout the novel . baron von geigern is a down-and-out man who steals to maintain his lavish lifestyle . he falls in love with the aging dancer grusinskaya one night when attempting to steal from her . she immediately latches onto him because he is young and she feels rejuvenated by his affection . the best scene in the book is that between the baron and grusinskaya the morning after ; it is filled with psychology and understanding of the two characters . kringelein is a pathetic man who comes to the hotel to spend his life savings on the last few days of his life , hoping to finally find happiness . he meets the baron who takes him under his wing to show him a good time . flammchen is a stenographer employed by preysing at the hotel who falls in love with the baron . preysing plots to cheat on his wife with flammchen who he becomes obsessed with , but is more concerned with the possibility that his company could completely deconstruct . dr. otternschlag is a sad man who always checks for mail at the front desk but never has any . he observes the hotel and acts as sort of a narrator at times to the story . each character is made realistic by the author , and the plot twist at the end serves as an appropriate and exciting climax . i read the book because i loved the film starring john barrymore as the baron , greta garbo as grusinskaya , lionel barrymore as kringelein , joan crawford as flammchen , wallace berry as preysing , and lewis stone as otternschlag . it is a wonderful adaptation and a beautifully photographed film . however , there are some differences , as there always are when books are made into films . the baron is slightly more likable in the book than in the film because more attention is paid to him . one needs to read the book to understand grusinskaya 's motivations ; since a young star played her in a very exaggerated way , the character seems more insane than justified in her actions . kringelein is somewhat less respectable in the book but just as likable . flammchen looks differently in the film , but is better developed and more realistic in it as well . preysing is just as dull in both . dr. otternschlag is paid much more attention in the book than in the film . overall , the book is more philosophical about the characters and their relationships to each other because it does not rely solely on dialogue like the film
