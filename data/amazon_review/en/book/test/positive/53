cross-wise alex cross is back , and this time he 's after the butcher , the man who killed alex 's wife some ten years ago and has been raping and killing ever since . this character , the butcher , is one of the more colorful in cross ' bag of collared criminals , and much of the book is spent in the butcher 's pov , which adds texture and depth to this novel . alex and his near-constant depression can be boring at times , when he 's fretting over nana 's workload , how little time he spends with his kids , whether he could have done more to stop the murder of maria , his wife , some ten years ago . but alex gets out of his funk long enough to track down the butcher , and this is a chase i enjoyed . whether or not alex will get bored in private practice and will go back to the fbi is a story line that did n't move me , so i 'm hoping he decides to go back , but patterson has another hit with cross , and this series just keeps going . for that , i am thankful
