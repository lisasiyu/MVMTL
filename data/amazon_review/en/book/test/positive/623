a must have this great little book is full of easy juicing recipes . another good thing about this book is that jay goes into detail about the vast , enormous benefits of a raw foods vegan diet . i am not a raw foodist , but as a vegan it is wonderful that jay informs people who buy this book who may not be vegan the simple fact that one can easily get calcium from other sources than cows milk . i have had a juicer for two years and still refer back to this book from time to time
