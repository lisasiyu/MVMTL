the best place to start to learn about castle life this book is absolutely the best place to start if you want to learn about medieval castles . it explains in very accessable prose how medieval castles came to be , how they evolved , the roles they served in medieval society , what they were like at their zenith , how military strategy through the middle ages centered around the castle , and how their relevance declined with the changes in technology and the political scene that came with the late medieval period . the gieses give the reader a very clear picture of what life was like for the people whose lives centered in or around the castle , from the nobility at the top down through the staff needed to keep the castle running to the villagers at the bottom . in particular , it shows the various functions that the castle staff needed to serve in order to keep things running smoothly , and the duties of those responsible for those functions , from chamberlains , chaplains , seneschals and stewards down to pantlers , haywards and reeves . in many cases , the best things are the historical anecdotes used to show a particular aspect of castle life , from the manner in which meals were served to the ways provisions were acquired in an era where money was by no means a common exchange , and how matters of jurisdiction often overlapped in problematic ways ( a lord might have jurisdiction over a castle but not over the forest surrounding it which belonged to the king ) . this is not what i would call the definitive text on all aspects of castle lore , but it is probably the single best place to start to get a clear and detailed education on , as the title indicates , `` life in a medieval castle .
