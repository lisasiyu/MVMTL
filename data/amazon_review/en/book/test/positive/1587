toning the sweep this was a good book because it show some values that you can find on the family , and how emily try to understand why her mama did n't like the desert . after she start to find answers at her questions she also get to know better her grandmama ola by making a videotape where she get to know better ola 's friends and learn to get along with people . this book show the way that this people were traveling scaping from something that is call saness going through different places , the real reason that ola was runing away from alabama was to save diane from the ugliness deth like it say on the book but this was n't the good way because you have to get infrom of your problems to solves them . that is why i agree with diane that ola was n't suppose to run away fron something she should n't . by the time emily find the reason diane did n't like the desert was because she did n't want to get away from the pain of her father that she found dead near a field of kudzu . that was the day that emily really felt for her mama and understand her loss . it say that diane wo n't ever forgive her mother from ripping it away . because i think that the only things that where attach to diane and that she remember about her father were gone and the only memory she has about her father were in her heart and that is okay because she will never forget her father even that she do n't have any oject that may remember her him . i think that emily realize that it really do n't take that long to get to know someboy if you really want to know them . i think emily haves a positive change because she learn to appreciate more her family and to understand the situation they hava passe . i think ola and emily really like the desert because there they really felt free like a bird and freedon if one of the most important value in the world . if you do n't think like that i do . i really like this book even that it show all the pain this people have and or their loss . but at the end it really teach you that family is very important if you have n't read this book do it because it can help you to apreciate it more . that all i have to say i hope you like what i have done
