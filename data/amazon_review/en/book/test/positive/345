first one to fool me ! vengeance in death by j.d . robb is the fifth book in this `` in death '' series by this author who is the alter ego of nora roberts . this pseudonym is only used for her futuristic series ( do n't let that genre fool you - these books are fantastic , even if you do n't usually like science fiction type stories ! ) it seems that each of the books in this series so far has the murders involving eve dallas ' lover/husband , roarke , in some form or another and this one is no different . if you 've read these from the first book , naked in death , then you 've followed the relationship evolution between the two strong main characters and you 've been given a glimpse of each of their pasts . vengeance in death explores , in greater detail , roarke 's past and that of his butler , summerset . a killer is loose and he 's killing men with irish links ; unfortunately , that irish link is roarke and his past crimes . summerset 's daughter , marlena , had been brutally murdered in dublin , ireland many years before and roarke avenged her death by killing the six men responsible . now it seems that someone is killing roarke 's informants from the past . it 's eve dallas ' job as primary homicide detective in the cases to find out who this mad man is and stop him before another victim is found . sounds like a typical `` who dun it ? '' type book right ? well with j.d . robb , you can always expect to find a bit more intrigue , romance and humor thrown into the plot . the added character of ian mcnibb ( electronic detective division wonder-boy ) is a pure stroke of genius . and the undertones of a romantic entanglement between mcnibb and officer delia peabody ( dallas ' able assistant ) leaves the reader wanting more and not being able to wait to read the next book to find out if these two actually do get together . one of my favorite support characters , mavis , is missing from this book - actually , she makes a very brief appearance , and that leaves a bit of fun out of the story line . but do n't worry - the other colorful characters are all there - commander whitney , police chief tibble , summerset , peabody , dr. mira , and of course eve and roarke . the identity of the killer was n't predictable this time , and actually had me guessing up to the end of the book . the clues as to his identity were few and far between , but the outcome made sense once everything was in the open . vengeance in death is more sound writing from j.d . robb and her versions of the future are impressive . i want a turbo car that can go from new york city to new los angeles in three hours just as they have in this book ! ( with gas prices the way they are now , i 'm wondering what kind of gas and gas mileage they 're getting in the future ! ) it will be interesting to see if the world is any closer to these creations in the year 2058 - only 57 more years to go and we 'll see ! but i 'm first in line for one of those autochef inventions that cooks your meal upon voice command - no cooking , no cleaning - ah , paradise ! vengeance in death is n't the best book in the series that i 've read , but it is still excellent .
