a great read ! bravo ! i have n't tried any of the recipes , but absolutely loved the essays in this book . most of them are hysterically funny . i 've never read any of mr. conroy 's novels ( though i 've seen the films ) -- but i certainly plan to read them now . the book also makes me want to visit the carolinas .
