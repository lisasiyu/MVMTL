a classic my husband picked this book up since he remembers it well from his childhood . he wanted it in our classic collection for our children ~~ and this book definitely belongs there . it is a classic novel about life . the narrator ends up in the desert and while looking for water , he runs into a little boy , who just happened to be from another planet . and this is his story . this is an observation of what it means to live . this is a story that pokes fun at businessmen , kings and so on ... but at the same time , it provides a sad truth that a lot of people miss when rushing around in life . the little prince talks about tending his own planet that only has one flower on it . he talks about love . he talks about hope and dreams . it is a very vivid story that makes you stop and think . and it is a classic ~~ i recognize the truths even sixty years after it was first published . it is still the same as it was then . life is too short to fret over everything . this is definitely a book everyone should read at one time or another and plan to re-read it over the years , as a reminder that life is precious . 10-27-0
