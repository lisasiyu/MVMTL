a superb book - highly recommended this is the best book about dogs in general and daxies in particular that i have held in my hands . do n't let the title fool you - this is a book that , while written in plain english , will teach you a multitude of things - how to care , train , and bond with your dax from puppyhood to old age . i have already recommended it to any dog owner i know , regardless of their breed , because many of the things inside the book are applicable to all breeds , not just the daxies . i highly recommend that you add this book to your cart , you will not be sorry you did
