i was surprised that this is such a good book when i see suzanne somers i just see chrissy from three 's company and all that snorting and dumb blonde-ing ! i never paid any attention to any of the suzanne somers books because i figured this was just another celebrity attaching their persona to something . my library happened to have this on the shelf and since i had some time to kill while waiting for my daughter to pick out her books i decided to flip through the recipe section since i knew it was a low carb type of diet and i do atkins . i was very interested at what i saw so i checked it out . i have been totally shocked at how easy and terrific her ideas are and in fact her philosophy is quite interesting too . i am really impressed . i have a totally different viewpoint now of suzanne somers . i love this recipe book so much i had to buy it so i & quot ; d have a copy
