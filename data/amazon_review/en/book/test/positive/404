better and better book # 13 in the in death series . in this book there is a serial killer on the loose and he is murdering people connected to roarke . eve is in a race to figure out who hired this hitman and whats the connection with roarke . there is also a visit from an old irish friend of roarkes who was thought to be dead . there is also some development in the mcnab/peabody relationship . while there are some tears shed , eve is forced to take a timeout to be a good friend to peabody . i love these books and as each one is so different , the quality is still excellent
