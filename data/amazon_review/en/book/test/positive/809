uneven but still worth reading first the good news . this book contains some of heinlein 's most interesting speculations , some of his most delightfully outlandish ideas ( there is a cat who really can dematerialize and walk through walls , and enough skewed gender politics and sexual antics to give the book an x rating : - ) ) , some of his most interesting characters ( several of them new , and many old , such as lazarus long and jubal harshaw ) , and probably the most well developed presentation of the concept of the world as myth . heinlein uses this idea to tie together the different books , such as glory road , stranger in a strange land , and the number of the beast , that are not a part of his future history series , by making them all members of the multiple timeline universe , or multiverse theory , that was discovered by mathematician dr. jake burroughs in the number of the beast . it 's a brilliant concept that unifies heinlein 's entire oeuvre under one integrating theory of temporal reality . now the bad news . the novel is very uneven and much of the action does n't seem to go anywhere , as dr. ames and hilda get chased from pressure dome to pressure dome on luna , finally ending up at time corps headquarters in another millenium . even worse , the ending is possibly the most unsatisfactory of any heinlein novel as it leaves the entire novel 's story and denouement unfinished , perhaps because heinlein intended to follow the book up with another novel . but as that never happened here it just ends in the middle of the action and there is nothing more to indicate how the story actually ends . half way through the book , it takes off in an unexpected direction ( although that 's part of the fun , since that 's where you get to meet all the other characters from past novels ) , and is where one finally learns that this novel is subsumed under heinlein 's temporal multiverse concept . still , there is little to motivate that based on the previous direction of the book . the hard-hitting , in your face , ultra-cool , smarter-than-you dialog that is one of heinlein 's trademarks , is so ubiquitous in the book so as to make it impossible to distinguish many secondary character 's personalities from one another , as they all act and talk and think the same way -- which is basically how gwen novak and dr. richard ames behave too . finally , almost everyone in the book is apparently a completely larcenous , opportunistic , and immoral entrepreneur who would sell his own grandmother to the glue factory if he could get away with it , especially the citizens of luna , who are proudly anarchistic , and who ardently believe that there ai n't no such thing as a free lunch . but apparently that means it 's okay to steal someone else 's lunch if you can get away with it . after awhile this never ending procession of unrepentent and ebullient scalawags , rogues , and profiteers gets to be a little tedious , and seems to indicate a darkening of heinlein 's views on human nature which first became evident in his novel , friday . the novel is still well worth reading for heinlein fans , but only if you 're familiar with many previous characters , concepts , and history from earlier works . at a minimum , this would include methuselah 's children , the green hills of earth , the moon is a harsh mistress , stranger in a strange land , the number of the beast , glory road , and possibly a few more that i 'm forgetting . so if you 're a newcomer to heinlein , do n't start with this book ; start with the many better introductions to his fiction , such as those recommended on several websites developed to his work . if you do a google search on his name , you 'll turn up several of these . the book assumes too much previous special knowledge to be comprehensible to the heinlein beginner , and reading this one could turn someone off who might otherwise enjoy heinlein with a little more knowledge and education . all that having been said , the book is still worth reading , especially for heinlein fans , since in this novel heinlein fully develops the theory of the world as myth that he introduced in the number of the beast . another strong point , for all those lazarus long fans , is that lazarus has a major role . and in the last part of the book , some of heinlein 's most memorable characters from previous books , such as jubal harshaw , slipstick libby , mannie davis , rufus and star ( from glory road ) hazel stone , jake burroughs , and others appear , and it 's fun to have all of them in one place at temporal headquarters interacting together
