amazing insight ! this book was required reading at our office and at the time i wondered why , after all we had a great team ! after taking the assessment test i realized we had lots of room to improve ! the story was a quick and easy read but very effective . we implemented many of the ideas in the book and work much more effectively today than we did a year ago . thanks for a great book
