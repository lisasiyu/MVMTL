i love this book ! ! this is a great book for a very young child , i started reading it to my daughter at 1 . it does n't go into detail about a birthmother or the actual adoption process . in fact choco looks for a mom like him and finds love in a family that is very different , but is very happy and loving . my little girl loves this book and enjoys the bright pictures of the various animals . i love that it opens the door to explain that loving families can look different from each other ... and that is ok ! ! ! i would highly reccommend this book to anyone that has a family blessed by adoption from any country .
