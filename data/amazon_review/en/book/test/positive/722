this book is very well-written , and informative the `` bad '' news : probably 2/3 - 3/4 of the books out there today related to dating , relationships , and attracting and/or seducing women are garbage . i 'm the author of my own book , `` mode one : let the women know what you 're really thinking , '' so i often tend to read other books that i feel might have similar messages and/or philosophies to my own . `` m.a.c.k . tactics : the science of seduction meets the art of hostage negotiation '' is a very entertaining and informative read . the book first caught my attention on page 18 , page 19 , and page 20 . these pages talk about taking action , and building confidence . self-confidence is the greatest psychological `` aphrodisiac '' for seducing women . women leave hints and clues about this all of the time . page 31 is great advice also . the whole entire chapter 5 is worth the price of the book . read it ... you wo n't be disappointed
