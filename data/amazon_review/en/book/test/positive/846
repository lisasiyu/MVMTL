enjoyed the book when i first obtained partners in crime by j.a . jance , i had no idea the story was taking place in bisbee , in cochise co. , arizona , which only added delight to my reading enjoyment . i lived in sierra vista which is also in cochise co. a few years ago , and i must say the descriptions were pretty much to the location . for me it was a step back in time . which made it a 5 star for me . i came in contact with sodium azide when my vehicle ran into a brick wall , which was a choking situation . maybe it will serve a purpose if everyone would contact their state representatives about how the substance is being left in discarded vehicles . it was refreshing to find a female sheriff in bisbee , az , it being a macho town like so many of the border towns . however sheriff joanna brady does very well being a newcomer investigating a murdered rochelle , who was in the witness protection program ; a second murder , and having to share the investigation with beaumont . i enjoyed the mystery ; it was a quick read with wonderful memories for me .
