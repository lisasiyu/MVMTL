fascinating i have always been fascinated with dr. king as one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century . i love the work that dr. dyson did in writing this book , because he is authentic in talking about dr. king the man - strengths , weaknesses and all - while exposing the myths about him . being african-american , i can understand why many within our community woud want to scold dr. dyson for exposing dr. king 's dirty laundry . i , however , consider it not only essential , but relevant that we talk about the true humanity of our leaders ( espcially one as esteemed as dr. king ) to avoid the danger of us elevating them as idols . it is a great reminder that god uses people ( albeit flawed people ) for magnificent works in a fallen world . this is a great book that i highly recommed !
