just about perfect written in 1948 , this engrossing tale of a group of misplaced wartime brits in a poor backwater in west africa touches on so many human qualities that it is a chronicle of our mortality . foremost is the perfectly presented portrait of a marriage that has turned into a lie for both henry scobie , the honest policeman of this coastal town , and his `` literary '' wife , louise , who has become the object of pity and contempt for all the frustrated local british `` club '' members who constantly mind one another 's business . scobie no longer loves his wife but ca n't bring himself to hurting her . he simply pities her . and louise no longer loves henry and wants desperately to escape from west africa , especially when she finds out that her `` ticki '' has been passed up for promotion to commissioner . the atmosphere becomes dark and twisted as a young man , wilson , appears on the scene and , in his youthful stupidity , falls in love with louise while he conducts secret investigations on british authorities suspected of aiding in the smuggling of industrial diamonds through africa to germany . scobie is one of those suspects . a marvelously film noir portrait of a corrupt syrian merchant , yusef , is thrown into the mix . i can see sidney greenstreet doing this part to perfection in a screen adaptation . add jealousy , desperation , a contrast of honesty and lies , sex , and the tortured feelings of a deeply religious man and you have most of what this novel contains . o yes , and then , as always , there 's the brilliant writing of graham greene , his wonderful metaphors , crystal clear descriptions , and fantastic insights into the crabbed and self-defeating thought processes of his characters . all this equals a modern classic . my only complaint is a bit of redundancy and pedantry regarding catholicism , a religion i can not stomach anymore , and my personal disbelief that someone like scobie can take catholicism so seriously . but this is my own thing . greene remains brilliant , original , and indeed , `` the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man 's consciousness and anxiety , '' or at least one of the top five
