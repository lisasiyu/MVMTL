another elizabeth berg triumph i normally cringe when i read `` read by the author '' on the front of a book on cassette because so many of them have no idea how to read out loud . elizabeth berg is a clear exception . she not only presents us with clearly delineated characters , each of them vocally fits the emotional description written by ms. berg . listening to the story is a delight . the story itself is a triumph . each character is endearing and embued with the berg warmth . paige is remarkably optimistic , diana is properly rebellious , and peacie is tolerantly loving . as i am listening , i am seeing them all in my mind and i 'm happy that they have come into my life for a few delightful hours .
