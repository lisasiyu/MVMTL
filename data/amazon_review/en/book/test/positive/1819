daddy 's little princess ? out of the despair of a young woman needing guidance and affirmation for her existence , my soul to his spirit is born . melda beaty longed for the type of love that tells a young girl she has worth , beauty and unlimited potential . for a male love that is disconnected from possession , obsession or penetration ; love that only a father can give . never knowing that magnitude of love , she harbored ill feelings for her father . traumatized since she was a little girl , her nightmares ended only after she became a woman with a legitimate voice , and truly forgave her father . since her atonement , ms. beaty has been blessed to meet and share stories with other black women with similar histories of overwhelming father-daughter relationships . relationships that more often than not , define how we relate to the men in our lives . my soul to his spirt speaks of the totality of our lives as black women and the full spectrum of kinship with our fathers . my soul to his spirit does not bash fathers , however , it does present a penetrating view from every possible angle . the six powerful chapters , loving : daddy 's girl ; distant : every once in awhile ; abandon : one day he was gone ; non-existent : could pass me on the street ; amended : time and forgiveness heals all wounds ; and deceased : gone too soon , cover the gamut of emotions daughters have felt for fathers . i applaud ms. beaty and all the daughters who contributed to this book of healing and strengthening for the family unit . i venture to say each reader will be familiar with at least one of the offerings . this is a humbling read ; an epiphany . reviewed by ann of the rawsistazÂ™ reviewers
