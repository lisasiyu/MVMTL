the feminist war on women . one of the major reasons why radical feminism remains such a destructive influence on the lives of americans is that it claims to speak for women when it really only represents a minute percentage of them . the feminista activist has proved quite adept at obscuring this fact by labeling their critics as `` patriarchal , anti-woman '' and `` sexist . '' the irony lost on many is that no social movement in history has so thoroughly undermined the constituency they pretended to represent . as always , the opinions of males are discounted , and whatever words men write are deemed compromised , so let us be grateful that carrie lukas came along . she is an equity feminist in the mold of christina hoff sommers and daphne patai , and what many readers already know is that equity feminist is to gender or radical feminist what the green berets are to terrorists . lukas 's new book is an insightful answer to the pervasive lies so often told about men . her main theme is that differences between the sexes exist , and there 's no reason to label them as good or evil . viva la difference should be the order of every day . by the end , you 'll be pleased that she took the time to pen such an eloquent refutation of the alleged , and fictional , patriarchy . lukas rationally cuts through the lies and distortions which so poison our ether . you 'll find skillful refutations to canards like men being the primary cause of domestic violence , that divorce is beneficial to women , and that being born with a particular kind of genitalia enables one to `` have it all . '' the real problem with gender feminists is that their need to dominate and control others is far more important to them than their supposed goal of bettering the lives of women . behind their hysterical passion hides a collective of dominatrixes . the only thing that their politics uniformly promote is an increase in their own status and increased feelings of self-righteousness . on aggregate , lukas 's narrative voice is outstanding as she is the possessor of an analytical and dispassionate mind . in my opinion , she even provides a more balanced assessment of radical positions than they actually deserve . the only negative thing i can say about this book is that i suspect few women will read it . my guess is that this is due to its not being feel good or warm-fuzzy enough for them . what those who habitually avoid the non-comforting forget is that knowing the truth is an end in itself , and that a hard chair made of wood is still more soothing than one made wholly from imagination .
