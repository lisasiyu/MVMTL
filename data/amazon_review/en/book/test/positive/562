it works ... .plain and simple . i had heard about the south beach diet 2 years ago through my mom and dad and sister . they all follow it and i thought i could n't do it because i was nursing my baby . i wish i had tried it sooner ! ! ! you can do this diet while pregnant/nursing and no matter what your health situation is ! my physician said it is the only diet he will encourage people to follow . it will work , it just takes a little discipline in the beginning ( phase 1 ) . you get through that and it 's easy street . i started the diet on march 1st , 2006 weighing 170 lbs . and a size 16 . i weighed myself this morning and am down to 145 and a junior size 11 . i am 5 ' 7 '' so i am technically well within my ideal weight range , but i am shooting for 140lbs . i know it will happen any day now . i am in phase 3 and i eat dessert ( in moderation ) , bread ( whole grain ) and lots of yummy dishes ! ! ! i 've even got my kids cooking in the kitchen with me and they eat foods you 'd never believe a little kid would eat . it 's a family plan and a way of life . i 've got so much more energy that i want to exercise any chance i get now ! my whole family is healthier and happier for it . i do recommend reading both books -- read them over and over ... i 've read the south beach diet 4 or 5 times . when you feel a little down or like you 're falling off the wagon , read it . it will reaffirm what you 're doing and why you 're doing it . try it , you 'll like it ! good luck~~juli
