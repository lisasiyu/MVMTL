an illuminating peek inside the corps ' `` closet '' in `` the masculine marine : homoeroticism in the u.s. marine corps , '' author steven zeeland offers a compelling alternate view of one of the united states ' most revered and recognizable institutions . an `` about the author '' note identifies zeeland as a research associate at the center for research and education in sexuality at san francisco state university . the heart of the book is a series of revealing interviews that zeeland conducted with several marines . his interviewees include both gay and straight men , and one woman marine ; he also includes both officers and enlisted men . particularly interesting is an interview with a gay black navy officer who previously had been an enlisted marine and who , at the time of the interview , was involved in an interracial relationship with a marine corporal . among the many themes covered in the book are marine tattoos , the `` gays-in-the-shower '' issue , marine attitudes about physical fitness and body image , the role of women marines in the corps , boot camp experiences , the `` selling '' of the corps through advertising , gay relationships , the `` coming out '' experience , defining masculinity , and the parallel between marine self-presentation and that of drag queens . a particularly important theme is the unique reputation and mystique of the corps ; in his introduction , zeeland notes that `` marineness is like a religion . '' specific male-on-male sex practices engaged in by marines are frankly discussed and provocatively analyzed . the book also looks at homoerotic rituals and language of the corps . the historical backdrop for the book includes the gulf war , u.s. intervention in somalia , and the beginning of the clinton presidency . the consistently compelling text is complemented by a sixteen-page visual section which explores marine tattoos , haircuts , physiques , and dress . there are photographs from the athletic model guild and other sources . a particularly interesting part of the visual supplement is a 12-panel comic by jerry mills entitled `` poppers '' ; this ironic , richly detailed piece is essentially a complete short story in comic form . the book is full of fascinating anecdotes and observations , both from zeeland and his interviewees . although zeeland is doing a serious scholarly project , complete with end notes , he makes no pretense at scholarly detachment . he notes in his prologue that his research technique involves befriending servicemen -- '' sometimes in an intimate way . '' he is sort of like an extreme jane goodall , passionately connected to the objects of his study . at times his writing and interview questions struck me as too self-indulgent , but in the end he has produced a human document that is both informative and profoundly moving . the book interrogates iconography , challenges stereotypes , and gives gay marines a space to tell their first-person stories . for a companion text , i recommend `` generation kill , '' an account of marines in the iraq war written by embedded reporter evan wright . wright documents some startling examples of marine homoeroticism ; he even quotes one marine as saying , `` man , the marines are so homoerotic . that 's all we talk about . '' like wright , zeeland has produced a truly remarkable contribution to marine corps literature
