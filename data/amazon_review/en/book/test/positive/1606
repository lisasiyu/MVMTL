not an accidental read at all ! i had not read much from this author except her 4 book series with beverly lahaye , but when our library had this one in large print , i just picked it up `` accidentally '' and decided to read it . i had not gotten into many pages when i was grabbed by the plot . i did not even know there was a second chance series and i rather wondered how a secular book could be re-written sucessfully as a christian fiction book , but this one was wonderful . when wes first met laney , he suspected her of being a stalker and/or kidnapper of children , and he had her arrested . his fears seemed rational until he heard her story . the child of wes and his deceased wife patrice , was adopted right after birth , and laney , the birth mother had finally found them through illegal means . the story then unfolds of two people who have absolutely nothing in common except their love for one little girl , amy . through it all the ghost of wes ' dead wife patrice hangs heavily over both their heads as well as amy 's . i felt terri blackstock drew upon some incredible experience as an author to format and carry through with this suspenseful , love-hate story and the twists and turns which led to a very , very strange and almost unbelievable bond between wes and laney . i wish to thank the author for re-writing this book and for using her talent for her new `` boss '' , god . i am now searching for other second chances books by this author .
