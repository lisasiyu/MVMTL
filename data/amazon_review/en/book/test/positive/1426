excellent this story of the battle for new orleans is interesting and extremely well written . it is not one of those deeply detailed scholarly works that drags on and on with details that you are not particularly interested in . mr. groom quickly lays out the facts of the matter . what he does best is make the historical figures in his book come alive for the reader . andrew jackson , no matter what his faults , truly loved the united states and was more than willing , almost eager , to risk his life for his country . and , at the battle of new orleans , with the future of the united states at risk , a pirate/privateer named jean laffite took the side of andy jackson . the battle they fought together , alongside the people of new orleans , is amazing . this briskly written book will tell you about some fantastic and tragically brave people
