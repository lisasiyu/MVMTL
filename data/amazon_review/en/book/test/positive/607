universal darwinism ? if you like to explore provocative ideas , then you will enjoy biocosm . gardner begins by arguing that a strong version of the anthropic principal is required to account for the goodness of fit between the physical parameters of our current universe , and the parameters required for the evolution of intelligent life . he builds on lee smolin ? s hypothesis ( the life of the cosmos ) that our current universe is the product of a long evolutionary history that has favored universes that could produce baby universes ( in the form of black holes ) and these same parameters are also favorable for intelligent life . gardner points out ( correctly ) that smolin 's hypothesis does not explain how such baby universes inherit the parameters of their mothers , and then offers a provocative solution . it is our future intelligent progeny that program the physical laws into future universes ( as they have in the past ) . this is gardner 's selfish biocosm hypothesis ( sb ) . gardner rejects linde 's `` eternal chaotic inflation '' plus a weak version of the anthropic principal ( eci & wa ) but it appears to me that gardner needs linde 's idea to produce the first universe with intelligent life . after that , sb might work . however , if eci & wa is needed to get sb off the ground , then sb is no longer useful , since eci & wa alone can account for the apparent goodness of fit between the parameters of the physical universe and the parameters necessary for intelligent life . despite my concerns , i believe gardner 's book is worth reading because it addresses some of the critical issues and constraints that confront any acceptable theory of cosmic origins
