great ideas and inspiration as proud new owners of an antique home in marblehead , ma -- built circa 1720 -- we were thrilled to find treena crochet 's `` colonial style . '' it helped greatly in getting our creative juices in motion . and the author even took time to respond to my e-mail inquiry about a ceiling issue which had us stumped . the book is a real pleasure to own -- just like our antique home ! ann and mik
