simple , clear and relevant presentation of the subject ! i read this book with enthusiasm and a new understanding of many of the integral buddhist concepts - even after having practiced buddhism for many years . the author brings some difficult and confusing buddhist tenets home and applies them to modern day examples which are easy to understand and grasp . my husband , a non-buddhist , found the book quite lucid , persuasive and enlghtening . anyone who is interested in an `` update '' and modern day application of this precious ancient philosophy will delight in and learn much from this book !
