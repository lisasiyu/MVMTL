distance and closeness and a way to bridge the gap . _victory_ is the first conrad that i have read since reading _heart of darkness_ and _the secret sharer_ in high school . i was unsure what to expect before i picked up the book . in any case , i did n't expect it to be what it was -- so contemplative and so concerned with notions of isolation and the ability to act . despite the abstract themes , the book is neither slow nor unreadable . an adventure story wraps the whole thing up : a recluse on a deserted island breaks his solitude and rescues a girl from a life with a semi-shady gang . this act of kindness starts a chain of events that brings violence and change to his small world . the story moves along nicely , and you can read for the plot even if you are uninterested in the bigger issues the book raises . i found that i was interested in them . heyst ( the main character ) has been infected by his father 's skepticism and analytical viewpoint and never manages to find a way after that to engage with the world or other people in it . his few attempts at engagement are awkward and almost unwilling . everybody in the book is to some degree isolated . wang removes himself from chinese society to go native . mrs. schomberg is locked behind her mask of fear . mr. jones and ricardo are set apart because of the obsessive fear the gentleman has of women . alma/magdalena/lena is set apart by her past . everybody is trying to connect , but ( with the exception of lena ) always on their own terms and always within limits . it 's tempting to read conrad 's own background and separations into the mix , but i 'll leave that to the conrad scholars . worth reading
