is feminism the f word ? i assign this book to students in my psychology seminar . these students at a women 's college tell me that they find women and desire to be thought provoking , interesting , even helpful . i noticed a column in newsweek by anna quindlen in october . she argued that women today still need the f word feminism because society has n't changed as much as we like to tell ourselves . it appears that the need for books such as this one by polly young-eisendrath continues to be valid
