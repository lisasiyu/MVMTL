lets get to the point following is a 4 part review consisting of : 1 ) intro and recommendations 2 ) point location review 3 ) meridian review 4 ) action/indications review 1 ) i am a first year acupuncture student at bastyr university . we have been using this text as the primary book for our meridians and points class . it is a good text ( one of the best out there for point location ) , and it is always undergoing revisions ( got to love an author dedicated to his subject ) . i also recommend the flash cards as a quick reference ( a lot easier to carry around ) and trail guide to the body by andrew biel ( isbn:0965853454 ) to supplement your education . 2 ) a manual of acupuncture is strong on point location with good images to help with quick reference . only a few discrepancies contained within the text . deadman usually gives clear anatomical descriptions in the text that will get you even more precisely to the point than the picture . there are a lot of quick ways to find a point , a few of them even work , luckily deadman stays away from most of them and chooses to give you good accurate descriptions that will be true all the time under normal circumstances . -- pet peeve exception : li-4 location note gives an unclear description of using the `` bulge of the muscle '' to find the point . this quick trick will have you needling in random directions in random places ( some of them hurt ! ) . the refined version of this trick can actually be helpful ... 1 . passively adduct the patient 's thumb so that it contacts the palmar surface of the index finger . 2 . with the hand radial side up put your finger on the highest point of the bulge ( this will be near the end of the crease ) . 3 . release the thumb and let your finger sink down as the bulge disappears -- there you go ! after all , if you are using tricks on the major points of the body you need to make sure they work on most of the people most of the time ; the rest of the time refer to deadman 's excellent text . 3 ) meridians are given clearly with detailed text . though our instructor subscribes to a slightly different theory for some of the fine points here and there , overall i have no complaints . again , i love the illustrations in this book . 4 ) basic actions are given , but without much explanation of the mechanism ( thank you kyo for breaking that down ) ; the long list of indications and a solid understanding of chinese medicine ( or good instructor ) will get you on your way to figuring out possible mechanisms . once you understand the theory it will eliminate the confusion initially created by a long list of indications . references are good , but you must always look beyond it an figure out why/for whom/under what conditions that prescription was written ; otherwise you will be trapped by ancient dogma and modern conditions .
