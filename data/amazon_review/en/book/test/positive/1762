the most beautiful story ever i have always loved paul gallico as a writer , and this short story is one of my favorites of his work . it is a beautiful story that children may like , but adults will love . the story is about a lonely artist , philip rhyader , who retreats from society due to a hunchback and deformed hand . he lives in a lighthouse where he creates his works of art and tends to injured animals . one day a young girl named frith brings him a snow goose that has been injured . ( i loved the book so much that i named my oldest daughter fritha . ) although she is at first scared of rhyader , a friendship develops between them as they tend the goose . after the goose is healed , it flies away but returns every year to stay with rhyader for the season . the girl , frith , returns each year when the snow goose returns . rhyader falls in love with her but she does not realize it . the book ends with the battle of dunkirk when the british troops are trapped on the beach . rhyader , who was unable to fight in the war because of his deformities , takes his small sailboat and crosses the channel several times , delivering the british soldiers to safety . on each trip he is accompanied by the beautiful snow goose . i 'll give you fair warning , the ending of the book is one of the saddest you will ever read . however , the message of love and friendship and hope conveyed in the book will make you want to return and read it over and over again .
