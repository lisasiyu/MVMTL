easy boat building concepts thoroughly explained i have read this book several times . he has a clear and logical way of presenting the stages of construction . his web site is informative and his video is equally as instructive . in terms of a complete `` how to '' series , i only wish other disciplines were as good . in addition to the quality of his construction , i am particularly fond of his designs . most other stitch and glue plans lack the elegance of sam 's designs
