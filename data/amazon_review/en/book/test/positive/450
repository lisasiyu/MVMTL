great book when it is n't a text book the forensic files of batman is about an equal mix of good and bad . when the book is telling a story where batman uses forensic science it is amazing . when the book just spins its wheels about forensics it feels like moench has just been cutting and pasting out of a text book . the book is organized as different journals written by batman , a young bruce wayne , alfred and jim gordon . the batman stories are well written with a great balance of science and story . not only are these stories great , but the final story of the book is also one of the best batman stories ever told . the young bruce wayne stories are the most informative , but all they do is educate with no story . they are just lists or long winded passages about forensics . they also have a childish tone that matches bruce 's age , but not of the overall book . the alfred and gordon chapters are great . each of them allows the reader to watch batman work without being in his head and make very interesting additions . overall , when this book is doing what it should it is great . it allows batman to fight crime with just his brain and really shows that he has earned the title detective .
