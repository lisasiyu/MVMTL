shamela : parodies-unlike their originals-are read only once henry fielding wrote shamela for the best of all reasons : he needed the money . the fact that richardson 's earlier pamela had been begging for burlesque in its absurdities and pretensions can be seen only as a contributory reason . in his preface , fielding makes it clear that he has placed richardson 's heroine squarely in his sights . he attempts to expose `` the many notorious falsehoods and misrepresentations of a book called pamela , are exposed and refuted ; and all of the matchless arts of that young politician , set in a true and just light . '' he makes it pretty clear that in the controversy as to whether pamela 's motivation for marrying the cad who tried mightily to seduce her are innocent or mercenary fielding sees as the latter . like pamela , shamela is a novel ( much briefer than pamela ) written as letters . but in fielding 's hands , shamela is seen as the master manipulator . where pamela faints whenever her mr. b. grabs her , shamela swoons too-but in coarse delight . with each passing episode , fielding inverts the moral universe of richardson so that when one considers richardson 's subtitle of pamela as `` virtue rewarded , '' one now sees with crystal clarity that virtue does indeed earn a reward , but the virtue of pamela and the virtue of shamela are alike only in their spelling . i am glad that i read pamela first , for if i had come across shamela first , i am pretty sure that i would have hooted and guffawed at a young innocent whose only crime was to follow on stage a deadly mimic .
