the barbadian immigrant experience in brooklyn , ny ... this is a worthy and ambitious debut novel about the barbadian immigrant experience in brooklyn , new york , by a little known african-american author , whose own parents emigrated from barbados during world war i . the author herself grew up in brooklyn . she attended brooklyn college , graduating phi beta kappa in 1953 , a time when most americans , much less a black woman , did not attend college . this drive to succeed is a testament to her barbadian heritage . it is from that heritage that the author drew in creating her characters and developing their rich mix of personalities , as she re-created the early barbadian immigrant experience in post-depression era brooklyn . the book focuses on the boyces , a nuclear family consisting of silla , the ambitious , hard working , ever striving mother , deighton , her charming , pie-in-the-sky dreamer of a husband , and their two daughters , ina , the older and more passive one , and selina , the bright , rebellious one . the novel follows the fortunes of the boyce family from the late 1930s until shortly after word war ii . it tells of their lives , their hopes , and their dreams . the book beautifully details the experience of the early barbadian immigrants in brooklyn and their adjustment to their new environment . they brought with them their own ideas , their own ways of doing things , and a work ethic that is hard to beat . quite frankly , barbadians revitalized areas of brooklyn that were dormant . theirs was an almost traditional immigrant experience , but for the racism that they were to encounter here . still , they did not allow that to stand in their way from getting ahead and going for the american dream . this book neatly encapsulates that immigrant experience through the boyce family . one gets a very good sense of what the experience of the barbadian immigrant was like through the interactions of the boyce family with others in their community , as well as with each other . while silla boyce typifies the barbadian community in terms of goals and work ethic , dreams and desires , with its focus upon material acquisition , her husband , deighton , does not . their separate dreams and desires conflict and act as a catalyst for a tragedy that would mar intra-familial relationships . it is also a coming of age story , as selina struggles to find her place in the new society and rich community her people are creating . she also struggles to find her place in the larger community , as well , stepping out of the insular one into one where racism is a factor . she is also interested in exploring her roots and heritage . still , being who she is , the reader believes that selina will not founder . though selina would hate to admit it , she is the one who is most like her mother , a fact of which she is not cognizant throughout most of the novel . she is truly her mother 's daughter , in thought and deed . this is a richly satisfying novel . the author captures the `` bajun '' way of speaking in all its rich , expressive cadence . while some may find this `` bajun '' dialect , which is interspersed throughout the novel , difficult to follow or distracting , it is this richness of language that give this book its very distinctive feel . moreover , while the author may sometimes get too bogged down with overly descriptive detail , she paints a vibrant picture of a segment of society that has too long been ignored in literature . those who like reading about the immigrant experience will enjoy this book , as will those who are interested in discovering worthy authors that have receded from public memory .
