it 's a gag gift , not as practical as the original the original worst case scenario handbook was a good guide , essential for your paranoid friends . i enjoyed that one , so for some reason my family has given me all the follow-on books as gifts . none of them really compare to the original , but this one comes close in some respects . many of the scenarios are completely outlandish , so do n't buy this looking for practical advice . unlike the original , this is n't a book to buy your paranoid death-fearing friend . some advice is practical , like dealing with swallowed mistletoe , driving in a blizzard , or dealing with a canceled plane flight , but it can get lost in the more outlandish , like fending off unwanted kisses , jumping from a runaway sleigh , fending off a charging reindeer , dealing with a meddling parent , etc . some situations just do n't boil down to 3 easy to follow steps and a diagram . i do love the section on repurposing a fruitcake , though . enjoy this for a small laugh and pass it around amoung the adults for the holiday
