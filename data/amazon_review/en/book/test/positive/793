objective , direct , accurate : excellent in the society of the muslim brothers , richard p. mitchell addresses the ideology of the organization . he takes the reader from the birth of the movement that would eventually challenge the egyptian government to it 's greatest and worst moments . he writes with an amazingly objective style , neither apologizing for the members who committed crimes , nor minimalizing the excellent social welfare contributions of hassan al-banna , the leader . of particular interest in this discussion of dualities is the point made about the dual legal systems . al-banna felt that the western laws `` corrupted and perverted the nation 's thought , mind and logic . '' mitchell 's point on this seems to hold vivid clarity in the idea that manmade laws and shari'a are innately incompatible . the inharmonious combination of this dual legal system `` served to shatter the `unity ' of the nation . '' mitchell 's writing really catches the essence of a group of people struggling to come to terms with a rapidly changing society in flux in a rapidly changing world . his book was translated into arabic and arab scholars agree that his portrayal of this politically powerful religious movement is academically sound
