a fantastic intro to cortazar cortazar was one of the more unearthly literary geniuses of the 20th century ; like borges and nabokov i return to his short stories often ( more than a decade after first discovering them ) , and can still get new things out of them . i agree with previous reviewers - cortazar 's precision with language rivals nabokov , kafka , proust or borges . i would add another comparison as well - though the intent is quite different , the very musical and rhythmic sensuality of the writing also recalls the best of ferlinghetti - cortazar is confident enough in his expertise to be willing to play with language in a similar fashion , and creates extraordinary and unforgettable worlds throught this ( and other ) collections . this is a great introduction to cortazar , with many personal favorites : `` night face up , '' `` idol of the cyclades , '' `` house taken over '' and `` axolotl '' are all unforgettable short fictions . i would n't stop there - cortazar 's other writing is well worth investigating ( especially the second story collection , all fires the fire ) . cortazar seems to be sliding into unfortunate obscurity as of late , with a number of key works currently out of print . thankfully , and for the time being , this is not one of them . -david alsto
