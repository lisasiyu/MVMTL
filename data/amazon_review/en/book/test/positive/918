best book ever ... tofcm was a awsome book . i enjoyed all of the authers different stories that were still under one over all subject . at times this book bored me in to a sleeping stuper but lucky most of the it scared me back into awakenes . at times in could not put down the book . then when that story was over and a new one came i got loney for the old story . over all some of the authers can wright and some of them ca n't .
