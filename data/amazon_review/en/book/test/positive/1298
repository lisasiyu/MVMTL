method in that madness this series of essays reanimates the real feyerbend , too often associated with a series of much denounced one-liners , such as the 'anything goes ' pronouncement . in fact , feyerbend rides the dialectical red zone in hairpin turns near the unexplored terrain where science fans , groupies , darwin fanatics , and the 'anally overtrained ' fear to tread , lest their weltanschaung be seen as romantic poets once saw it . as a science fan myself , i can only watch in wonder and some sadness the 'social construction ' , in the age of big science , of something more sophisticated than , but not altogether different from , what the church fathers concocted from thin air , thereby freezing the minds of the many for millennia . it ca n't happen again , but it can attempt to happen again . that 's the nice thing about science , you will lose all your paradigms , sooner better than later
