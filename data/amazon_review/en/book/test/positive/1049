the ultimate suppliment i found that this book contained everything i 've been looking for : great new weapons , very useful feats , and lots of new prestige classes ( i always wanted to make a samurai ! ) & quot ; sword and fist & quot ; also contains various buildings which can be useful for dms to base , for instance , a guard tower or an elf house on . if there is anything i was dissapointed about was how little information there was on chariots , but then , the book would also be better a thousand pages long . five stars
