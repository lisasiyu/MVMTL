do n't just know lincoln , understand him . i 've read many titles on lincoln and have come to know the man , his words and his deeds . but now i can say that i understand him . american revisionists have lately found it fashionable and all too easy to knock down our heroes and charge them with crimes from the perspective of the twentieth century . yet , boritt 's insights are a wonderful celebration of a true american hero . and better yet , boritt makes no apologies for it . perhaps we needed to wait for this foreign born author to remind us what has been really important about the usa all along . wrap yourself in the red , white and blue and feel patriotic again . oh , and by the way , do n't let the title scare you . the book is quite an easy read
