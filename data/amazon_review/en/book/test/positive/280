a brilliant but flawed man after watching the film , `` finding neverland '' , i was curious to learn more about the fates of the 5 boys orphaned in the story . although barrie did not gain custody of the boys , he did maintain a strong presence in their lifes . in fact , he did much more than just keep an eye on them over the years . he showered them with gifts ; traveled with them ; and of course , financially helped them . he seemed particularly obsessed with the older boy , george . barrie loved to photograph all of the boys and some of the photos included in this book show the children naked . was barrie a pedophile of sorts ? none of the boys ever accused him of such . and barrie 's love and concern for the boys did not end when they became men who were tall enough to tower over the diminutive playwright . this is a comprehensive look at barrie 's life without passing any judgement . that is left to the reader . and after reading this book , i have to say that i 'm still unable to figure the man out . he is an enigma . there are tons of photographs - one or two on just about every page . original correspondence and notes from barrie 's diary/journals add further insight . a fascinating , and sometimes tragic look back in time
