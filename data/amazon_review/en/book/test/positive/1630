eda goldstein & ego psychology eda goldstein does a great job of describing , in detail , ego psychology from a historical , theoretical , and practical perspective . i was particularly fond of part ii dealing with the ego and its functions and defenses . she writes with a clarity that is difficult to find when reading books dealing with detailed theoretical perspectives . i would highly recommend this book to socials workers and pyschologists alike . it is a wealth of information that you will find yourself referencing again and again
