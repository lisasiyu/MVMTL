this lays out all the ways we women keep getting beaten down ... here it is now , 2006 , and we have moved back into the 50 's in so many ways . look at so many 20 somethings like paris hilton and the ways she disgraces herself without any inkling that she is doing it . look at all the role models we see in films and tv , where women are either bitches , promiscuous , or over-siliconed airheads . thank god howard stern is no longer on tv . we 've come a complete 180 degrees , and women get no respect . i do n't think hilary clinton and condoleeza are any help . the women we see in public have no conception of how their public imcompetence , stupidity and general buying into the concept of woman as sex object for men has hurt us . now men feel free to dispose of their wives by killing them . the number one cause of death of pregnant women is by homicide . let a woman with a history of being abused by her boyfriend go missing , and the cops do n't bother to look for her . it 's ok to the authorities if young women get killed . who cares except the grieving family ? it 's common in high schools for girls to be physically abused by their boyfriends , and the girls still love and protect them . women are to be used , abused , and disposed of . our society is run by men , for men , and it has not changed one bit in the past one hundred years . we ca n't even decide for ourselves anyomore if we want an abortion . daddy government says no . all the right wing `` christians '' running the country really just want to keep women in the dark ages before abortion , barefoot and pregnant and out of the work force . and women do n't even get it ! i am currently packing to move to scandanavia where women are respected and treated as equals . birth control , abortions and prostitution are legal and accepted . unlike america , in a few countries women at least own their own bodies
