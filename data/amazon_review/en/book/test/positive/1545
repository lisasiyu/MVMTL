reading theory is n't supposed to be this fun , is it ? for those who enjoy the challenge of reading high theory but are put off by the dry , abstract , pretentious ramblings that more often than not constitute theoretical writing , zizek is the theorist for you . is there another theorist alive who can on one page explicate the finer points of lacan , hegel and kant , while on the next page tie it all in with the three most popular female pubic hair styles , homosexual ; and subtle distinctions among toilet designs in germany , france , and the united states ? perhaps . but zizek makes these seemingly awkward transitions and uncommon examples quite smoothly ; the outrageous examples are n't forced , nor are they merely for & quot ; shock & quot ; value . in short , they work to clarify the difficult concepts he is discussing . although zizek is not what i 'd call an easy read - not by a long shot - he certainly knows how to make a challenge a bit less stressful and - gasp ! - fun . en
