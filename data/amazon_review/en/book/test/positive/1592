great help i just actually finished reading this book yesterday . it was given to me by my counselor , to whom i seem to talk to quite often about my son 's behavior and how frustrating it is to me . i was amazed with each new section of this book at how many of these behaviors are caused by temperment . i 've been told in that past that my son ( 7 years old ) has a difficult temperment , but i never really `` got it '' until i read this book . i did n't realize that a lot of what goes on is n't even in his control a lot of the time ... .that 's just how his temperment causes him to act or react . i could n't believe how much of this book `` hit the nail on the head '' as i was reading it . it really made me feel like there may just be something i can do about my son 's difficult behaviors and his attitude and `` freshness '' . i ca n't wait to try all of the suggestions that stanley turecki gives . i can finally now see that things my son did even as a small toddler relate to all of his tempermental issues and that i am not being a `` bad '' mom like i 've so often felt i was . i highly recommend this book to any parent of a hard-to-raise and hard to understand child . you 'll surely walk away with some enlightenment and some great tools to help you with your child and also to help your child to better his/herself .
