a new approach to female relationships i asked for this book because i thought it would give advice on how to raise daughters -- it does -- and more . dr. northrup begins by explaining how mothers and daughters are connected through the generations , and how we can only create a healthy relationship with our daughter when we heal our relationship with our mother . as we heal ourselves , we heal all the women who have gone on before us . this is only a sample of some of the insight she offers into our relationships as women . i 'll admit i was surprised by the holistic approach she takes , but am glad she offers that insight , as i 'm only vaguely familiar with some of the ideas/theories and believe i have more to grow in that area . rather than a book geared towards raising children ( i 've read my share -- and i thought that 's what this book would be ) i would categorize this book as a self-help book geared toward strengthening and creating a healthy relationship with your mother and daughter . very pleased with everything i 've read
