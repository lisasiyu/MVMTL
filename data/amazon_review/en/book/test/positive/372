quick , enjoyable read ... quirky , comical writing ! : - ) i 've seen several not-so-good reviews of this book so i wanted to write a good one . i 'm not finished reading it yet , but i only have about 60 pages left and i 've read enough of it to know that i 'm thoroughly enjoying it . there are parts of the book that are laugh-out-loud funny and other parts that are so detailed and insightful that i am enjoying this novel on many levels . if you like authors whose writing is what i call `` quirky '' ( a little on the weird side but i mean that in a good way ... interesting and funny details on almost every page ) , you 'll love this book . i know that my local library has at least three other books by this author and i intend to get every last one of them during my next trip to the library . the kind of quirky , comical , insightful writing that i like is best represented by the following book , which i actualy bought instead of borrowing it from the library , and i do n't buy books very often : a girl named zippy : growing up small in mooreland indiana by haven kimmel http : //www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767915054/ref=pd_sxp_f/104-1969313-5510321 ? v=glance & s=books if you liked `` until the real thing comes along '' by elizabeth berg , you will absolutely love `` a girl named zippy '' by haven kimmel
