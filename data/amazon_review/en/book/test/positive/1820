excellent resource ! i have been reading book after book for my upcoming police tests and this is by far the best book for interviews . the information i have learned from this book applies to almost any interview not just the police one . i found that i had already begun categorizing people so i knew how to communicate in their language in my interviews for my small business . i am excited to try these techniques in the police oral interview . i feel extremely prepared for the interview thanks to this book
