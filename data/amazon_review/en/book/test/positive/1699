a useful reference book this very complete volume is a lovely gift book as well as a useful reference book . the only weakness is the lack of emphasis on arm positions when doing the steps although they are illustrated in the photographs . i believe dancers who have experienced the following will find it useful too : when i was a student of ballet , i was frustrated by the subtle differences in the standards of different teachers . sometimes i wondered , & quot ; so how exactly am i supposed to do this ? & quot ; i did not enjoy being corrected for what a prior instructor had taught me and pronounced well-executed . this book would have clarified things for me at the time . now that i practice alone , i find this book invaluable . also , i support christine 's review dated may 4 , 2001
