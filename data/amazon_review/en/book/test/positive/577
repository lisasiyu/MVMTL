great resource for the classroom ... . the giant jam sandwich is written by the same author as cloudy with a chance of meatballs . the pictures are cute and engaging . this story is easy to follow and readily lends itself to be used as a `` think-a-loud '' . what a great catalyst for simple writing activities for the k - 2 classroom . i am very pleased with my purchase
