mockery from within this not-quite-debut novel ( fellowes wrote several romance novels in the mid-'70s under the name rebecca greville , including `` poison presented '' and `` court in the terror '' ) ought to appeal to fans of his 2001 oscar-winning script for the film gosford park . a straightforward satirical comedy of manners set among the upper classes of mid-'90s england and those who aspire to join them , the book is a frothy comic brew which skewers both parties with the kind of pitch-perfect subtle writing that it seems only the british can pull off . the story is quite simple , a pretty woman from an upper middle-class family whose mother has pretentions decides to ensnare a hugely wealthy and dull aristocratic man in order to `` marry up '' into the upper classes which still hold such a mystique and importance in british society . the man 's mother , a formidable marchioness aims to prevent this from occurring but fails . the young woman discovers that life at the top is n't as exciting as she anticipated and runs off with an handsome actor to great scandal . will anyone find happiness at the end ? this is all more or less narrated by a semi-aristocratic actor ( clearly very much like the author ) who is able to move between all worlds due to his upbringing and career . he starts the book as a friend of the young woman and a very passing acquaintance of the young man , and ends up becoming a bridge between worlds and at the latter stages , a kind of discreet go-between . it is his penetrating sardonic insights and the witty formulations thereof which lend what substance there is to this otherwise straightforward love story . much of the novel involves the narrator spelling out the unspoken rules of the game for the reader in deliciously mocking detail . the main flaw in most satire is that it is too broad or unsubtle , but here the narrator 's mockery of the artificially preserved world of the aristocracy is all the more effective from its insider position . to be sure , the characters are mostly `` types '' without a whole lot of substance or depth to them ( the boorish rich pig , the nasty arriviste , the brisk no-nonsense wife , the ice queen , the social climber , etc . ) , but that 's kind of the point as well . a great deal of the satire is that these upper crust people have no personality , that they are all just filling the roles they 've seen before them and imagine will extend after them forever . ultimately , the book is somewhat bittersweet in that the writing is quite amusing , but one ca n't help but feel slightly sorry for how unhappy so many of the characters are ( even if they are n't particularly deeply drawn ) . on the other hand , it 's not too hard to feel like it 's a case of them getting their just desserts ...
