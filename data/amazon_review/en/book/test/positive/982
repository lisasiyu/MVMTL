bright new scholarship based on intellectual tradition scholarship in the field of islamic studies has improved steadily since the 1970 's . whereas islam was often viewed as a monolith , and from an orientalist perspective , current scholarship has been more informed of the realities of the religion . unfortunately recent popular media and writing has tended to reverse this positive trend and outlook . many books , articles and classes are back to portraying islam and muslims in terms of divisive characterizations . muslims tend to be viewed as `` fundamentalist '' , modernist or opposed to western civilization . the spiritual dimension of the religion , sufism , is often viewed as outside the core foundations of the religion . the divisive perceptions by both muslims and non-muslims reflect some actual situations but do not contribute to much needed mutual understanding . the authors of this work demonstrate that only with an integrated approach , which includes the depth of the spiritual tradition within islam , may issues in the current crisis be addressed and lasting solutions found . what is unique about this book is that it explains the current situation and crisis we are facing ( particularly as a result of the terrible tragedy of september 11th ) based on a more complete understanding of the islamic intellectual tradition . this tradition always refers back to a metaphysical , meta-historical reality defined not only by islamic revelation , but by all the world 's great religious traditions . it would be easier to simply state positive aspects of islam without rising to the challenge of addressing the specific problems , issues and negative images the western media has confronted muslims with . it is even more rare to see these issues addressed from the perspective of a long-standing intellectual tradition based on sacred texts and writings of eminent figures in the past and modern eras . the authors in this book manage to incorporate sound scholarship and critical analysis using the resources of the spiritual and intellectual tradition of islam to address the difficult questions now challenging the islamic view . the book edited by joseph lumbard includes : a foreword by seyyed hossein nasr ; a qur'anic analysis of the term `` jihad '' by david dakake ; a study of the decline of knowledge based on the islamic intellectual tradition of `` ihsan '' by joseph lumbard ; a response to modern secularism by fuad naeem ; an analysis of the spirit of jihad by reza shah-kazemi ; a view of the roots of modern misconceptions of islam by ibrahim kalin ; an application of game theory as a strategy for dealing with the politics of terrorism by waleed el-ansary ; a muslim response to the social , economic and political impacts of globalization by ejaz akram ; and a perspective on the effects of fanaticism on the muslim community by t. j . winter . this work constitutes a refreshing collection of articles that succeed in stimulating the debate on the current world crisis and in taking account of the problems from an integral approach to islam
