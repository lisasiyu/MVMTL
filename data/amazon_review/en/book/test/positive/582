personally appealing , largely impractical in the reinvention of work , matthew fox brings together the work of eastern and western mystics , ancient , medieval , and modern , to propose a new paradigm for how we work and what we do . citing meister eckhart , thomas aquinas , hildegard von bingen , the bhagavad gita , tao te ching , studs terkel , patch adams , and progressive economists , fox explores the concept of work and how it can be healthier physically , emotionally , and intellectually , but primarily socially , environmentally , and spiritually . fox believes that the enlightenment and the industrial age have left us with a machine-centered , anthropocentric world that focuses on outer work and rewards at the cost of inner work and spirituality , and destroys rather than creates . real wealth results from preserving the health of the planet , not in the artificiality of money or possessions . the result has been a world often at war , where the gaps between affluent and poor continue to spread , where the environmental health of non-industrialised nations is sacrificed for the comforts of the industrialised , and where the work that is available and that most people have serves machines and leaves the worker stressed , addicted to work , ill , angry and even violent , and unfulfilled intellectually , emotionally , and spiritually . fox cites mystics like eckhart and aquinas to show that they understood what is important and that they prophetically understood the traps that man is prone to fall into . he also recounts the stories of people who reinvent themselves through work , who are willing to sacrifice position and possessions to find an avocation that matters , like the man who gives up a high-paying position to become a fireman and who is ecstatic about the meaning it brings to his life . fox carefully sets up all that is wrong with our modern concept of work and , indeed , life , since so much of who we are , how we feel , and how we live is tied up in what we do for a living , or what we mistakenly call `` work . '' his proposed solutions are centered around creation spirituality , which is a `` creation-centered mysticism that is also prophetic and socially transformative . '' while creation spirituality is not very clearly defined here-fox has written several other books about it and refers to them-it appear to center around the idea that creation comes from within and that we create our world , which is part of a greater , interdependent cosmos that continues to undergo creation . for fox , `` enlightenment '' might mean recognising and embracing creation spirituality and our responsibility and role in the ongoing creation of the cosmos-a recognition that begins with inner work and extends outer work , and that redefines wealth and poverty . fox is quick to point out that this is neither communism nor socialism , both of which suffer from the same destructive values as capitalism . there are many elements involved in creation spirituality , which embraces many aspects of life that have been neglected , distorted , or abused , from education , health care , art , psychology , and sexuality to something he believes is critical yet missing or misused-ritual . in creation spirituality and the reinvention of work , properly conceived and performed ritual is meaningful , bringing people together , bringing out emotions , and acknowledging what has been done in the name of war , destruction , and hate . ritual can also be playful and energising , for example , circle dances . whatever the focus , ritual brings us together to share our common joys and sorrows . ritual heals . mysticism appeals to me , and fox 's assessments of what 's wrong and what could be done to change our course make sense and are supported by the quotes he provides from a broad array of sources , including psychologists , economists , writers , and artists . the consequences of not changing are clear , but it is equally clear that those consequences have not penetrated to either the masses or their leaders . ( even the rising price of gasoline in 2005 has not inspired any more than cautious apprehension . ) we are like smokers who are able to quit our habit only when terminal lung cancer has been diagnosed . to get billions of conditioned consumers ( and their consumers-in-training children ) to give up their increasingly complex lifestyles , comforts , and amusements in the interest of a healthier , more just world for all and for better personal mental and physical health requires a utopian change that most people will not embrace . as with the woolgers in their book , the goddess within , fox tries to find a movement in the mid-1990s that has not materialised yet . generally , people do not choose to change ; they are forced to . perhaps someday , when the gaps have widened too far , and society and our home can no longer support our appetites ( and the corresponding waste ) , we may be ready to listen to fox and his adherents , at which point they will need to provide practical answers . who will `` make ritual '' ? who will produce the necessities and how ? who will distribute them ? how will they be paid , or what will replace a monetary/barter economy ? what if there is imbalance between what people want to do and what needs to be done ? in practical , everyday terms , what does the reinvention of work look like ? and do i want to live long enough to experience the disasters that are likely to be required to bring it about ? eckhart , aquinas , von bingen , the bhagavad gita , tao te ching-all wise beyond their times . and beyond ours as well . diane l. schirf , 21 august 2005
