illuminating this has helpful stuff in it . i even went out and bought a stopwatch to time certain tasks to speed myself up , as this book recommends . but the time obsession is kind of ridiculous at times , to the point where you almost expect mr. mccormack to say , & quot ; if you could shave making love to your wife from 15 minutes down to 15 seconds , you 'd save so much time. & quot ; to get philosophical , abraham maslow wrote the seminal book toward a psychology of being where he writes of the & quot ; self-actualized & quot ; personality , that he considers the most highly evolved personality type , but who are less than 1 % of the population . one common trait amongst these extremely happy people is they often experience & quot ; peak experiences & quot ; where they feel immense joy and these experiences & quot ; trascend time. & quot ; these people lose track of time during these experiences ! ! ! ! now , it seems an obsession with time such as mccormack preaches would completely interfere with one 's ever having such joyful experiences . i suppose it 's like a lousy movie , where you are always looking at your watch , versus a great movie , where you forget about everything but the movie . so , i suppose to be successful and efficient , you have to say good-bye to happiness in a big way . but it 's success that is supposed to make you happy , right ? a major contradiction !
