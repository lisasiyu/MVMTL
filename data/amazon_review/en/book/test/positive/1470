a thoughtful novel under western eyes is not a light novel but a deep , refelctive study of the russian intellect and society . this book permitted me to understand what we westerner 's often cast of as the & quot ; russian personnality & quot ; and the complexity of the historical , social and psychological climate of russia and the russians shortly before the bolshevik revolution . this novel does not ressemble any ohter of conrad 's as it has a strange feeling or atmosphere to it that can barely be grasped . i read it when i was young and i was deeply affected by the people he describes and the locations . a must for anyone interested or related to the russian nation
