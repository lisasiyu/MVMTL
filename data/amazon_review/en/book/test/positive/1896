great yarn , great look at the twenties everyone knows the expression , `` ponzi scheme '' , but i doubt many knew the derivation . mr. zuckoff lays out its derivation in this terrifically readable book . the real mr. ponzi immigrated from italy , moved around , being arrested in montreal and mississppi , before settling down in boston where he started a `` rob peter to pay paul '' scheme which now uses his name . ponzi offered 50 % return on investment in a mere 45 days in 1920 . mr. zuckoff points out how the american psyche was so ripe at the time for such get rich schemes . ponzi took advantage of that mindset and in a brief period - just a matter of months - compiled a fortune . it is truly unclear from the letters , quotes and litany of acts by ponzi whether he ever believed he could repay all his investors or was knowingly just trying stay ahead - one step before the law and one step in front of running out of money to pay investors . certainly he could have fled back to italy at any time before getting caught , but he never did . until the authorities caught up with him he was able to continue paying his high ball interest . mr. zuckoff 's portrayal of the con artist shows him to be so charismatic and colorful that the reader gets swept up into him just as his many boston supporters did during the ponzi-mania . you almost have to root for the little guy . mr. zuckoff also portrays the antagonists - whoops - the journalists and authorities that catch up to ponzi very well . the editor of the boston post is another rags to riches hero of the book . although this is , for the most part , the history of ponzi and scheme , the author paints a complete picture of the times in which he was able to perpetrate his scheme/crime . this is what makes this book a more comprehensive history than just the telling of the scheme and how it was uncovered . to make the book even more entertaining , it is written almost like a novel , with each page revealing a bit more of the story . this very readable book is highly recommended .
