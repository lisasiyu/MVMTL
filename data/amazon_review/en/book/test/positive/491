a must read as we enter ww iii being a child of the self indulgent baby-boomer generation this book shook me to my roots , not only by how different things were then but by how similar they are now . as i read this book i could n't help but be amazed by how the characters , whether on a personal or a societal scale , mirrored those we see today . most of all herman wouk provides a crystal clear view of the events leading up to ww ii . the characters are memorable , though i feel that this is wouk 's shortcoming in this book . the historical characters seem to be developed more strongly than the fictional characters of the henry family , around which this book centers . i feel that wouk left the main characters purposely undefined as a way to make them appear more complex . the historic characters did n't suffer from this , perhaps because wouk had to rely on historical accounts of them . this books seems to hold up well for historical accuracy and provides an incomparable sense of perspective for anyone wishing to learn more than just the facts of that era . i prefer to read classics and believe this book might be easy to trash on that level but the story itself and the realism with which wouk tells it makes this one of the very best books i have read to date . this is an imoprtant book that should be read by everyone wishing to understand the events leading up to world war ii . it can happen again and as i write this in late 2005 it seems likely it will .
