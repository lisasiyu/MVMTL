pack it for the plane ride a serial killer 's pedophilia leads him to disguise cop-suicides as murders and to toy with the investigators who unexpectedly begin to put together the pieces of his bizarre crime . connelly alternates between the first-person perspective of the reporter who first suspects that all is not as it seems and the point of view of the murderer . too much description of the plot will give away its many surprises , which come together in the ingenious final pages of the novel . suffice it to say that the book offers a potent mix of ingredients that will keep most any reader going : love , sex , death , envy , personal ambition . all of the things that connelly does well come together in `` the poet '' : his ability to craft a complicated plot that nonetheless fits together like clockwork , to build a mood , set a scene , put together a tight workmanlike sentence . best of all , the book displays his trademark noir hero whose own darkly human qualities make him the right man to locate the monster-killer whose trail he follows here . it 's just perfect for the story that jack mcevoy , the protagonist , is a reporter who stands to benefit from uncovering the crime , and that it 's his own good twin who was the original murder victim . as almost every other reviewer here has mentioned , this book is a class-1 page-turner . i read it in a day while on vacation , never slowing down except to eat . what fun ! it 's also kind of a kick to see how far we have come in the past ten years from the `` cutting-edge '' technology that helps investigators solve the crime here ( the book was published in 1996 ) . despite the laptops that mcavoy and others lug around , jack has to read edgar allan poe 's entire corpus during one sleepless night in order to identify the quotations the killer leaves as clues . today , of course , a `` google '' search would do the trick in about ten seconds
