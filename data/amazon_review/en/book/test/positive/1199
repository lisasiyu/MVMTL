a nice , brief look at the 265th pontiff having studied the work of joseph ratzinger ( benedict xvi ) and read more than half-a-dozen works on him , i came to `` god 's choice '' with a significant cache of knowledge on the subject . while weigel 's work and social commentary ( perhaps best known through his syndicated column ) remains a source of contention and , at times , controversy , i was rather pleased with this book . i believe that the major fault of the work rests in the initial focus on john paul ii ( which occupies more than 100 pages of the 268-page book ) . like david gibson in his `` the rule of benedict , '' weigel apparently felt it necessary to remind the reader of all the great details of benedict 's predecessor - a task i find to be superfluous . that said , it is a good book . i was delightfully surprised at times while reading this book to find that weigel had occasionally rendered his advisories an appropriate level of respect . citing john allen , jr. , ( chief vatican correspondent for national catholic reporter , often noted by being at ends ideologically with the views of weigel ) and others , weigel significantly avoids polemical spin in a way that has garnered new respect from this reader . however , it should also be noted that there remains a peppering of weigel 's clear and present agenda throughout the book . while at times is appears fleeting or subtle , reader beware that his ecclesial and cultural politics surface here and there . perhaps one example would suffice . while addressing his opinion of a `` progressive catholic movement '' and its possible cardinal-elector representatives , he makes the unfounded and impertinent remark : `` that , in turn , may explain why the progressive project is infertile - increasingly unable to attract the brightest students in graduate schools of theology in the united states . '' ( weigel 136-137 ) without any substance , using vague terms , weigel makes a sweeping statement regarding the state of graduate theological students - as it pleases him . all in all , this is a wonderfully written work . weigel is clearly intelligent , while politically transparent , and his writing style engages the reader . i would recommend this book as a companion volume to the many other works dedicated to elucidating the life and work of benedict xvi ( see john allen , jr. 's `` pope benedict xvi , '' h. j. fischer 's `` pope benedict xvi : a personal portrait , '' and joseph cardinal ratzinger 's `` milestones . '' )
