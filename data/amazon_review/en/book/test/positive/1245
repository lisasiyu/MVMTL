the final bow of the musketeers before you start this book you should know that any resemblance between the book and the movies that hollywood has turned out is completely accidental . the names of the main characters are about the only similarity that i could find and as is the norm , the book was much better . this , the last installment in the musketeer series , gives us the story of the final acts of our heroes , athos , porthos , aramis and d'artagnan . unlike many literary characters our musketeer friends have aged as the story progresses and have all retired but d'artagnan who is still the captain of the king 's musketeers . athos and porthos are quite wealthy and aramis has attained the rank of bishop . aramis is not content with his station however and knows a secret that he thinks he can use to become pope . this secret is the knowledge that louis xiv has a twin brother who is hidden away in the bastille and aramis is quite sure that this brother would make a better king than the current monarch . aramis is also pretty sure that the new king in gratitude will nominate his liberator for the office of cardinal and then will scheme to make the new cardinal pope . in this plot aramis acts alone except for some help from porthos who has no idea what he is involved in . the twins are successfully switched for a short while but then the plot falls apart and aramis and porthos flee for their lives although porthos is still not sure what is going on . the `` pretender '' to the throne is left to his own devices by aramis and is imprisoned in a new location with the iron mask added to his discomfiture . aramis does not come across in this book as much of a hero and in many respects this story is much darker than it 's predecessors . given the advanced age of the musketeers , there are not nearly as many swashbuckling adventures as one is accustomed to but on occasion porthos in particular will rise to the challenge . the political intrigues of the court of louis xiv and the decline of the musketeers are in fact the main plot lines of this story . in the end , only one of the four is left and to find out which one you will just have to read the book . athos , by the way , only seems to play a side role in this story and is neither involved in the plot against the king or in his rescue . as is always the case , dumas ' writing style is superb and is filled with historical fact . he does tend to be a bit wordy and his books are often much longer than necessary but even with this slight drawback he ranks as one of my all-time favorite authors . in this book dumas closes out the careers of his most popular characters and he does it with style
