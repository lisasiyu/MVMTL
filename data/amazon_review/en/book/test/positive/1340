we 're not as objective as we think we are thirty years ago dr. kassirer was my chief when i was a medical house officer in boston . ( that will serve as my disclosure of possible conflict of interest although we have had little contact since that time . ) he has been a wildly successful nephorlogist/researcher , clinician and teacher . as editor of the new england journal of medicine , he constantly expressed concerns over possible conflict of interest and its influence on published medical literature . this book is a highly researched and extensively documented look at conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest in the medical literature and other closely related areas of medicine . sometimes there are situations where potential conflict of interest has little or no influence on our decision making . as amply documented in on the take , there are other times when conflict of interest may impact our decision making to the detriment of our patients . this book examines when and how the harmless potential conflict of interest moves into the realm of a serious , even ethical , dilemma . amazingly , these conflicts may extend beyond the published medical literature to consensus papers and clinical guidelines increasingly embraced by the government and major medical societies and these conflicts of interest may even intrude into organizations designed to protect the consumer like the fda ( food and drug administration ) and the cdc ( center for disease control ) . we as physicians minimize the extent to which potential conflicts of interest influence us in our medical practice - a view not widely shared by patients or government regulatory committees . dr. kassirer presents a number of suggestions to improve the situation . some of these are already being implemented by major medical journals . others will depend on the integrity of individual practitioners . this book should be a must-read for medical students - both those planning to do medical research and those who will use the medical research to guide their medical practices . martin g. kistin , m.d
