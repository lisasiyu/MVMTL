somewhat helpful , very interesting i myself write westerns , so i bought this book in the hopes that it would help my writings be more accurate . while the information contained in this book is n't quite as specific as i would have liked , it does have some very interesting and entertaining facts , such as slang terms cowboys used , the terms used for the different hairstyles during the 19th century , and common diseases that plagued the population . it also lists the different types of horses , which is a tremendous help for me . if you write novels or are just an avid history buff ( of which i am both ) , then i think you will find this book interesting
