like a trip back in time if that slow , plodding ric burns series on pbs was the official history of new york city , & quot ; you must remember this & quot ; is the indispensible people 's history : actual voices from the turn of the century ( the last century ) telling what it was really like to live in the immigrant lower east side , the hell 's kitchen waterfront , jazz-era harlem , the last stretches of rural inwood . with this and & quot ; the box , & quot ; kisseloff is hands-down the most perceptive and consistently fascinating oral historian i 've read , and yes , that 's counting studs terkel . buy one for yourself , and one for a history-lovin ' friend
