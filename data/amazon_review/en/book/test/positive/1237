ten weird , surprising , tense , comical , and often unforgettable stories a family on vacation encounters a cold-blooded gang , a gullible and naive housewife is struck by a mysterious ( but hilariously common ) `` illness , '' a 104-year-old civil war veteran is a featured guest at his 62-year-old daughter 's high school graduation -- each of o'connor 's stories portray characters in improbable , bizarre , and ultimately harrowing situations . these tales are weird , surprising , tense , comical , and often unforgettable -- but what exactly do they all mean ? o'connor was often frustrated by the sense that readers and reviewers misunderstood both the intents and the themes of her stories . in her first letter to a fan from atlanta who became a frequent correspondent , she complained that `` she was mighty tired of reading reviews that call 'a good man ' brutal and sarcastic '' and that `` when i see these stories described as horror stories i am always amused because the reviewer has hold of the wrong horror . '' i think she sells herself short with this assessment , however . her stories are brutal , they certainly can be sarcastic -- and the fact that readers confuse the horror is confirmation of the ambiguous and harrowing ( and , yes , gothic ) underworld her characters inhabit . the reason her stories are classics of the form -- and the ten stories in this collection are among the best i 've ever read -- is not only because they are creepy and grotesque , or because she is the master of the ominous set-up and the unexpected ending , but also because after you 've found out what happened you 'll probably lie awake wondering why it happened . `` christian realism '' was how o'connor described her spiritual stance ; `` i write the way i do because ( not though ) i am a catholic . . . . i am a catholic peculiarly possessed of the modern consciousness . '' decades of critics have argued over the theological underpinnings of her fiction , but an assessment by a fellow author named george clay helped me make sense of her themes -- and the author herself approvingly summarized his remarks in her own correspondence : `` [ clay 's ] interesting comment was that the best of my work sounded like the old testament would sound if it were being written today -- in as much ( partly ) as the character 's relation is directly with god rather than with other people 's . '' it 's not hard to find the ghosts of job , ruth , samson , esther , isaac , daniel , and others in all of her stories . whether these echoes make for good theology will depend on the reader 's own spiritual inclinations -- but they certainly make good reading . my favorite piece in this collection is `` good country people , '' probably o'connor 's most famous ( excepting the title story ) . describing a lonely woman with an artificial leg who is seduced by a traveling bible salesman , the story veers into an inexplicable climax that is both devastating and melancholy . and those two words pretty much sum up any of the stories you 'll find here
