this book was amazing ! i was visiting russia this summer , staying with the grandparents of one of my friends . there was one shelf of books in english in the room where i stayed , and the mind parasites was one of them - i read it in one day , i could not put it down ! it was just an amazing book ! and since no one who lives in the home where i stayed speaks or reads english , i could have easily just brought the book home with me , but i thought & quot ; oh no , i 'll just buy my own copy when i get home. & quot ; now i 'm kicking myself , hard . i had no idea the book would be out of print and hard to find ! the copy i read was nice , too . whoever owned it took good care of their books . i 'm seriously thinking of writing to a friend over there and asking him to go over to the house i stayed in , and get the book so he can send it to me
