great , but unconventional batman book ... `` forensic files of batman '' truly is an entertaining read . people often forget about batman 's intelligence , overfocusing on the action elements of the dark knight genre . while some readers and reviewers are nitpicking on little details ( e.g . commissioner gordon still working , no mention of robin , etc . ) , this book is meant for all , not just diehard fans . if you like good detective short stories or are a general batman fan , this book is for you .
