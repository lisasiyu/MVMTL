fiction , but non fiction as a long time civil war buff i found this book utterly fascinating . it takes the true story of general sherman and his march to the sea and fictionalizes it just enough to make it intriguing and even difficult for someone to put down who has little interest in the civil war . more importantly it explains the reason why he destroyed everything in his path . william tecumseh sherman was hated in the south and even today , to a great extent he still is . however , his intent was by destroying the food supply , to shorten the war . he did succeed in his goal . read this book and you will have a true understanding of why the civil war began and lasted as long as it did .
