a pioneering effort when i first discovered that a new burton biography by a professor of history was soon to be published i had high expectations . upon receipt of professor kennedy 's burton biography titled the highly civilized man , i started digesting his work . the asserted themes of the work included 1 ) placing burton and his work in context with the larger issues and challenges of victorian times , and 2 ) using burton to better understand the nature of changes beginning to percolate socially due to the interaction of victorian england with its colonial enterprises . indeed , as far as i know , this approach is pioneering and insightful . as i continued reading to about page 90 , i thought professor kennedy 's effort was well done , and the book would be another jewel to adorn the crown of burton research , along with the work of mary lovell . i am of the opinion professor kennedy succeeded in achieving both this stated objectives . from this standpoint , his book is a success . the observations of burton as a harbinger bridging the transition from the victorian era to the modern era reflect the type of insights one expects from a biographer trained in the rigors of academic scholarship . i enjoyed the in depth academic analysis of burton from the standpoint of concepts of relativism as applied to notions of cultural difference . professor kennedy has also highlighted the role played by burton in the early development of anthropology as an academic discipline . social/cultural anthropology 's primary research methodology is called participant/observation . certainly , this approach was an inherent part of burton 's nature , and the scope of his anthropological observations were derived by this research approach . i was also glad to see that professor kennedy gave particular attention to discussing burton 's stone talk and his kasidah . the earlier biographies did not devote much attention to either of these important works . as long as kennedy stayed focused on academic based scholarship he avoided the pitfalls that plagued the earlier biographies that predated lovell 's rage to live . unfortunately , the book digressed into complicated histories that are not fully recounted . yet , professor kennedy felt compelled to make several definitive conclusions sorely lacking the professional level of scholarship a professor should be required to meet . the outcome of kennedy 's failures is a setback in burton scholarship . given the effort to place burton in context , the irony is that the book with notable examples omits necessary context to understand and evaluate some of the professor 's conclusion . for example , the recounted history of burton firing over the head of a crowd of greek orthodox christians fails to acknowledge that burton resorted to this solution after trying less violent alternatives , and after he and fellow members of his party were injured by rocks thrown at them . the key point is that burton used a hierarchy of options to confront unstable situations . this point also relates to the absurd conclusion that richard and isabel were role-playing in the desert , and that there is a hidden psychology to uncover . the decision to have isabel act as richard 's son was an attempt to protect her from rape and death , and to give richard an option before resorting to lethal force . the burtons took their personal safety serious as illustrated by their habit of carrying two revolvers and three bowie knives when traveling . professor kennedy has a mildly obsessive theme about people burton did not know going into the desert for homosexual interludes that randomly pops up in the book . he includes a discussion of burton and several earlier biographers who speculated about burton 's sexuality . but kennedy failed to note those writers assumed richard and isabel had a loveless and sexless marriage , and they used outmoded , almost now quaint , modes of freudian analysis . the illusion of the burton 's loveless marriage was gutted by the original sources brought to light by ms. lovell . professor kennedy fails to point out the deficiencies of brodie and mclynn concerning their analysis of burton and sexuality . the deficiencies in the highly civilized man about the question of burton 's sexual interests are too numerous to address in a short review nor are the issues he raised concerning damascus , crowley and others . kennedy 's treatment of burton in damascus is a travesty . not once does the professor inform the reader that all segments of society in damascus worked to bring burton back from his recall . the damascus treatment is lacking in necessary detail and skewered to the degree that the discussion should have been deleted form the book . it is also one of the examples where kennedy included information that is extraneous to accomplishing his two professed themes . the book appears to have been written with segments produced using an academic analysis methodology with other portions written in an almost stream of consciousness with points lacking critical evaluation . moreover , there are instances of contradiction . this leads one to conclude the work was not scrutinized properly before going to press . the kasidah analysis includes a conclusion that burton believed there is no god or afterlife , yet in the chapter titled the afterlife , kennedy indicates burton may have concluded there is continuing life . in fact , towards the end of the kasidah and towards the end of note 2 , burton makes it plain he has a positive view on a continuing future life . it is not a life however with the attributes of anyone 's religious acculturation . the chapter on the afterlife in large part is one of the commendable aspects of this biography . all of the hallmarks of a work that will withstand the centuries are present in this work if only the good professor would later reissue it , and correct the many deficiencies and expand the themes of burton as harbinger , burton as catalyst , burton as a pioneering mystic and burton as scribe in the manner of thoth , the ancient egyptian principle of wisdom .
