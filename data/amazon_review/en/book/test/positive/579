great book really nice book for night and low light photografy . step by strep approach , great examples , really wonderfull photos . i think that it will make me a better photographer . the only thing is missing is one chapter for digital photography ( to be honest i am a amateur photographer that i have shot only with sony cybershot f-717 and lately with nikon d70 ) but i give 5 stars because all the technics the author gives ( apart from the ones related to film section ) are applicable in the digital world as well
