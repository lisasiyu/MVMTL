good book , but ... .. this is a very useful tool for real estate agents , & the letter templates are good . my only complaint is that they have a floppy disk included in the back of the book to download the forms onto your computer . if it had been a cd instead of a floppy , it would have been much better . nothing wrong with the material , i can recommend the letters , but some computers do n't even come with floppy drives anymore . if they 'd switch to a cd , then they 'd have a winner .
