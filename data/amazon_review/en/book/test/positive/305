great starter cookbook and great for snacks i bought this book after seeing another book by raab at a friends house . i bought a copy for our home so that my then teenagers could have a simple easy to use cookbook . it has good basic food that appeals to teens and young adults . it tells how to stock a pantry , tools you will need and other helpful hints about keeping your kitchen clean and operating kitchen appliances . it even has soup recipes , pizza , meatballs , hummus , cookies and many more yummy recipes . i was going to send this to my son who is away from home for two years serving a church mission but , i could n't bear to part with it so i sent him his own copy . another great book by raab is `` the clueless vegetarian '' well worth the price ! ! ! a
