an excellent and understandable introduction to chemistry while most of the one year chemistry texts cover more or less the same principles , the order varies , the illustrations are similar , but they vary most in the way they explain the material . it is in the vocabulary they use and develop that helps the student develop the intuitions , understanding , and skills the authors are after . this is a very well written text that is useful for non-chemistry majors as well as science students needing an introductory course in chemistry . i am reading and working through this text with my 13 year old son . yes , he is bright and interested in science , but the text is clear enough for both of us to be able to grasp and understand the principles each section of each chapter is presenting to us . not only does this text focus on teaching the basic principles of chemistry , it also includes historical notes in the margins , and the text focuses on the practical uses of chemistry to illustrate its principles through practical applications . while other texts also have these features , i believe this text to be quite accessible to even those without a strong previous grounding in science . each chapter begins with a series of bullet points introducing what is going to be discussed along with a short essay . i like the marginal notes and illustrations as well as the `` give it some thought '' feature that asks the student a question or two in order to clarify understanding and ensure a grasp of the principles introduced in that section . like most modern textbooks , there is also a liberal use of color to aid in presentation and guide the eye . the authors also provide occasional `` strategies in chemistry '' boxes that encourage the student to develop a certain kind of thought process and ways in looking at the principles of chemistry . at the end of each chapter is a section called summary and key terms that hits the highlights of each section in a paragraph or two with the key terms in boldface . then there is a section called visualizing concepts that have basic problems with illustrations in order to get the student to work mentally on the material learned . the section of problems has a series of questions for each section with the red numbered questions having the answers in the back of the book . there are also a series of handy tables provided as appendices and standard charts on the inside of the front and back covers including the periodic table . again , many of these features are included in other texts because there has been quite a bit of convergence on what is to be taught in a one year introduction to chemistry course . the differences are in the way things are said more than what is covered . i think this is an excellent and very useful text for learning the basics of chemistry and why it matters in our world
