invaluable i am so grateful for this book and to barbara feldon to write it for us . it prepared me for the holidays and how to plan for them so i could get through them . i am thankful that she helped me avoid pitfalls during vacations . and her clear and simple direction about designing my financial independence put me on the right track . her wonderful hints how to have nice highlights with people with whom we interact all the time is making my daily life filled with kindness and friendly smiles . i still refer to her book all the time when i need to remind myself to be kind to myself and when the solo life gets rough sometimes . it is a must-have
