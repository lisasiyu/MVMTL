going overboard : the misacventures of a military wife wonderful ! so true ! your husband does n't have to be a pilot for a wife to have this happen . my husband is with the air nat'l guard and a fireman and is in iraq for a 4month deployment `` we '' volunteered for ! all those feelings happen ! it was so reassuring first to know i was n't alone and second to know that reservists and national guardsmen go through the same feelings too ! god bless the military and god bless their spouses and families for supporting them and what they do ! tammy schnitke
