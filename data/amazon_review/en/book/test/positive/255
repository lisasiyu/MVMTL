better than road to serfdom this was a brilliant book . the language was much shorter and more precise than in road to serfdom . i know that it was one of hayek 's traits to not use mathematics , but it would have been nice if he demonstrated some of his ideas with at least a little math . or gave us the references if we wanted to look them up right at the bottom of the page . particularly neat was his off-setting things that were not critical to the argument in small type . as it stands , the book is almost 100 % empirical evidence of why socialism does n't work . and kudos to the author for calling socialism and communism what they are , which is religion
