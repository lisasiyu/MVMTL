kudos for photoshop cs2 bible you wo n't be disappointed if you purchase this great reference ! not only did the book impress me , but so did the help that i received from laurie ulrich fuller , one of the authors . when i had a couple of questions , i sent her an email . usually one has to wait for quite a while to receive a reply if they even do receive a reply . with laurie i received a reply in less than 24 hours ! she was friendly and did n't seem to mind answering my questions . how wonderful it is to find someone willing to help you . no matter how good a book is , it really makes a book outstanding when you can get responses to any questions that that may come up . it keeps one from feeling frustrated . i rate the book tops
