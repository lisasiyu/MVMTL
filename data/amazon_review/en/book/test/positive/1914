good but not complete i just finished the historical atlas and while the book does a great job of touching on so many subjects in such a small space , it leaves a little to be desired because it does not focus on any one point in the city 's development enough . i would have enjoyed the book more if it had a little more detail on how landmarks came to be where they are , and what the political an social culture of the city was at different time points that influenced the way the city developed . i suppose that was n't the book 's intent , though . also , it would be nice to get a follow up chapter on the city 's continued development since 1994 . overall , i thought the book was a good intro to nyc history , but i think i 'm going to try a more in-depth history to fill in some gaps
