concise and nearly complete steven stavropoulos has chosen some of the most well known quotes of the ancient greeks for this book , and some which are more difficult to find . this is an excellent reference book for anyone who would like to quickly look up a quote on `` love '' , `` virtue '' , `` justice '' , etc . i can see where his translation is slightly diffent from others that i have read , but the message is still transmitted very accurately . this is a must own for anyone who enjoys reading about greek philosophy , theater or culture
