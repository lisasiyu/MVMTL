so good , it should be illegal ! ! ! impress your friends . intimidate your enemies . buy this book ! ! ! i must echo the sentiments of an earlier reviewer . i was a returning college student in my late twenties . i had to take several remedial courses just to bring myself up to speed in math and english . between the techniques in this book ( mainly mind mapping ) , meditation and subliminal memory tapes ( the last two are not in this book ) i finished my second semester with three a 's and two b 's . also , i made the deans list . the section on speed-reading was so great ; college was the first time in my entire life that i could read so fast i actually had time to go over my answers and check for any possible errors . i rarely found any . if you are in a super hurry to improve your memory for testing , i suggest skipping to the mind map section . however , you really should go back when you have more time and read the whole book ! !
