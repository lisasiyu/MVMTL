an amazing book - one of kosinski 's best i have read most of kosinski 's works of fiction , and i must say that this is one of my favorites . it is more along the lines of steps or the cockpit , but it is a little more experimental in its story telling . there are different narrators , both first and third person , who tell the story of a very wealthy young man 's journey through life . like the characters in steps and the cockpit , waylen is very self absorbed and often performs horrifying acts of revenge on those who get in his way . i would recommend this book to anyone
