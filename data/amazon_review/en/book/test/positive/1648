beautiful pictures and words i have a 6 month old daughter and she loves this book ! the colors are bright but not too busy and the words flow easily . i love the fact that the narrator is chinese-american and is able to blend traditional chinese culture with contemporary american culture . i ca n't wait until my daughter understands what it is saying and can begin to pick out shapes
