the best book in the universe bar none except no substitutes numero uno etc ... . yes , this is my all-time favorite book , and it begins my all-time favorite series . can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of herriot ? i will try . first of all , this book takes place in england , and i am a committed angliophile . it is warm and compassionate without being soppy . it is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever . prior to herriot , i exclusively read fiction . not just any fiction , but science fiction and fantasy fiction , both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite ( eeuurggh ! ) . reading herriot made me realize that the old saying `` truth is stranger than fiction '' left out something . truth is better than fiction . enjoy wiht my compliments
