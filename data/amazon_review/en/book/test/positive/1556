highly educationaly i found the book very useful for any budding entrepeneur . one can learn a lot from mistakes from mr. winn . also one gets good insight into how these top company execs think and operate ( i.e not as well as you would imagine ! ) i have the audiobook and the narration by kuo is excellent , very real and humorous
