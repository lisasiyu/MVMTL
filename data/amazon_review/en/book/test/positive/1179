do yourself a favor and read it ! this novel got great reviews and then got forgotten . that is a shame . everything you know is funny , sad , moving , and utterly convincing . ms. heller did a superb job of getting inside the mind , body and soul of man just past his middle age . it 's quite a feat and quite a book
