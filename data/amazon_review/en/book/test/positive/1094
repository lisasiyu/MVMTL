excellent this is an excellent book for actually trying to understand this difficult subject . firstly its not bogged down with obsolete american units , though it does cover enough examples for anyone who really wants to go that way . secondly there is a wealth of tables and properties in the index , which alone makes this book worth the money as a reference tool , ( and all in simple si units ) .third , there seems to have been a determined effort at getting the message across . the one shortcoming i have found is the lack of a list of symbols/abbreviations used throughout the book ( hence the lack of the fifth star rating ) , though they thankfully are pretty standard . my tip - if you read this very worthwhile book , jot down the symbols as they crop up then you wo n't waste any time having to track them down again . these comments do not apply to the identical version that comes with a software supplement ( i tried it but couldnt be bothered to get up to speed with the mathcad its written with )
