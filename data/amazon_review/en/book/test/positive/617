oh , eve ! book # 23 in the in death series . this book had the potential to be the best in the series . but eve 's ever increasing sensitivity issues made ruined it 's perfection . as the swisher family is brutally murdered in their sleep , their is a lone survivor and witness , their young daughter nixie . in the beginning eve embraces the child reluctantly when she finds her in the home hiding . you feel eve can relate to her terror . then when eve brings the child into her home to protect her , she does everything she can to alienate the kid . come on ! i thought eve was growing and then she takes a giant leap back . it was just a little to over the top for me . too much lack of compassion . thank goodness for raorke and sommerset . the mystery is top notch , and peabody is back on the job . i just wish eve would take some sensitivity classes . other than that another excellent book .
