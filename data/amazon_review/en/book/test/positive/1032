amara awakenes the late richard laymon 's book `` to wake the dead '' is about a mummy who comes to life to terrorize the los angeles community that is housing the egyptian exibit . also there is a strong side story about people being kidnapped and held as sex slaves somewhere . that is actually the creepier story . but the mummy one is really a dandy too . the mummy story is not my favorite horror theme ( and i did not like the stephen sommers/brenden frasier movies , either ) , but then it had never been presented like this . actually a lot of it was very h.p . lovecraft influenced ; mentioning of the evil ancient snake god set , the museum is named after charles ward , starting to see the resemeblence ? the characters were less than i expected . after reading `` in the dark '' i thought he would have some richly developed characters ; but i guess there were just too many to juggle to give them all proper time to mature . there were the kidnap victims , the blind woman , the runaway teenagers , the hedonist egyptian , the museum curator and her boyfriend ; i guess too many subplots and not really tied up effeciently . but this is still a great book , and i think any fan of horror will enjoy it
