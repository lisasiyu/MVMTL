van gogh cafe was magical to read . the book i am reviewing is the van gough caf√© by cynthia rylant . i think book is great because it 's so imaginative . this book is about a cafe where things happen . there really is no problem in this story . it is more about everything magical that happened in the cafe . i would recommend this book to everyone in my reading class . another book cynthia rylant wrote is wedding flowers . this story deserves five stars ! emerson , nj ; fifth grade studen
