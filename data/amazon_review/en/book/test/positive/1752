must reading for a better sense of the man i had been familiar with the kenny book & quot ; wittgenstein & quot ; and & quot ; wittgenstein 's vienna & quot ; but after having read monk 's vol 1 on russell knew this would be an excellent read . oddly enough it left me with the question , & quot ; are geniuses born or made ? & quot ; much of what monk did for us with this book was give us a solid feel for the life of the person within which the philosophy could make sense . why did wittgenstein write the way he did ? answered . what issues drove him ? answered . i would say this book is must reading for a better sense of the man
