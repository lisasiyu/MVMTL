cleansing the mental palate of political correctness it is a crime that the founders of america are dismissed because they are represented as failing to meet our present pc standards of faux morality . this terrific book takes on every pc misconception about them and sets the record straight . while never presenting them is marble pillars of morality , the author puts all of the issues in their proper context and demonstrates clearly the intelligence , morality , and rightness of our founders . one of the most famous of the old canards that you will still hear is that the founders only considered slaves to be 3/5 of a human being because it says so right there in the constitution . how sad that misunderstanding and misrepresentation is . because each state was given a number of representatives based upon the number of residents , the issue was whom do you count . you have to first ask yourself whom the representatives from the slave holding states would represent . the slaves ? of course not ! so , if the rights of the slaves were not going to be protected , to give their slaveholders the ability to count those slaves as people and thereby become over-represented in congress would actually work against interests of those people trapped in slavery . those opposing slavery wanted the slaves to remain uncounted for representation . the slaveholders wanted them to count as a full person ( does that mean the slaveholders cared about the human rights of the slaves more than the abolitionists ? ) . the compromise was to count them as 3/5 . however , it is essential to remember that those who wanted the slaves counted as a whole person were uninterested in the rights of those human beings and those that wanted them uncounted actually had the interests of the slaves more in mind . professor west also takes on the issues of property rights , who had the right to vote and why , women and their rights at the time of the revolution , poverty , and immigration . a good and informative read . every student should read it as an antidote to the misinformation they get during their indoctrination at the public schools . this book will actually aid their education and help them develop a solid understanding of what is really at stake in our country . and it might spark some lively debate when they go to class armed with some information the teacher will likely find inconvenient or even bewildering . one of my daughters actually had to go to the blackboard and explain the 3/5 issue carefully to the teacher and class . the teacher commented that she had never thought of it that way before . which , of course , means , that she had always taught it as a political tenet rather than history .
