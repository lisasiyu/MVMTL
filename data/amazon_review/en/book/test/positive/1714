worthwhile elementary text . this book covers a lot of ground , so if it starts with some awfully basic stuff , that 's okay . the only real complaint that i have is that the authors are a bit too rah-rah for my taste when discussing marketing , but then , that 's probably par for the course ; everybody who is into marketing tends to go overboard on the bubbly , fake energy . that , and the fact that they demonstrate an astounding lack of understanding of basic arithmetic when they assert that `` while saving 2 % by paying a bill early may not sound like much , doing it over the course of a year will save you 24 % '' .
