welcome back , ms . plum after the letdown of the previous book in this series , it is nice to see stephanie plum back at her real occupation , ace bounty hunter . well , maybe ace is not the right term , but let it be . the characters are fine and funny , as in the first ten books . the gritty streets of new jersey are not exactly scenic but they are very real . and there is an actual plot , rather than a series of humorous sketches that wear thin when not attached to anything . as for dialogue , that 's why janet evanovich 's fans keep coming back for more . she has a real knack , an excellent ear for the nuances of street dialogue . i can now rest easy for a while , knowing the writer has not run out of material . my greatest hope is that she does n't have a relapse in the 13th episode , that triskadecaphobia does n't do in our heroine . p.s . this is the very best of the twelve books in the plum series , and stephanie holds the record for the most times a central figure is tasered in all of fiction
