please see my review [ mistakenly ] posted to volume one i accidentally posted my review of vol . 2 on the vol . 1 site . & quot ; reader from dc & quot ; seems to have deliberately done the same even tho ' he 's attacking something from the intro to vol . 2 , hence my confusion . will post an actual review for vol . 1 once i 've read it..
