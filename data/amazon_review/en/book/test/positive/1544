very good expose randi does a good job exposing geller . the only problem is that sometimes randi does n't go all the way and reveal the magic trick for fear of giving away magician 's secrets . this book is out of print , since no one pays attention to geller anymore ( partly due to randi 's efforts ) . having said that , i would also like to point out that randi is n't always fair in his tests of psychics . i 'm not endorsing psychics mind you , i just think randi should give credit when it 's due . for instance , when randi was on the `` ron and ron '' radio show on wynf in 1995 ( ? ) , he asked psychic gary spivey what he would be doing on wed. night . spivey correctly guessed randi would be flying on an airplane , to which randi , who was obviously flustered , spat and sputtered and finally said `` well , anyone could have guessed that ! '' later , host ron bennington pointed out , if `` anyone '' could have guessed , why did randi ask it in the first place ? randi should have just laughed it off and said `` ok , let 's see you do that again ! '' so , how do i know randi is right about geller ? when faced with the alternative of uri geller being given psychic powers by aliens or using magic tricks , i would take magic tricks as an eplanation .
