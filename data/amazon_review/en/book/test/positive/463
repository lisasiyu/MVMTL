he knows what he 's talking about in the spring semester of 2004 , mr. rubinstein was my trigonometry teacher . for those of you in new york state , that 's the equivalent of the last term of sequential math iii or the last term of the math b curriculum . being a tenth grader at the time , i found his methods of teaching to be one of the best . not only did i enjoy being a student in his class , but i also enjoyed learning math and because of him , i continued to pursue advanced math classes . when he made a mistake , he was never afraid to let us correct him . he is a humble man and is able to connect with his students on a personal level . there was never anything fake about him . now that i am a senior in stuyvesant hs , i look back and see that i never had a math teacher , or teacher of any subject , quite like mr. rubinstein . there are only a few teachers like him and i feel lucky to have been taught by him . if his book is anything like the way he teaches , then many people will learn from him by reading this book
