excellent , practical advice i made the mistake of buying the first edition of this book ( published in 2001 ) , but found it to be an excellent guide to the legal issues involved with public domain textual material . i have already published one book which relied heavily on public domain materials , and am working on a second , and when i bought this book i had several specific questions that i was trying to answer . this book answered all of them , as well as some that i had n't thought of ! i 'll probably end up buying the second edition , just to see what has changed in the last few years
