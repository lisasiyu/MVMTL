an all-inclusive encyclopedia of the academy awards this book is not a history in the since of most history books . it does not detail how the academy began , or how it changed over the years , or give you any kind of insider view of its workings . instead , it is a complete listing of every nominee and every winner in every category since the award ceremony 's inception in 1927 . there are plenty of photographs of the nominees and images of scenes from the nominated films for each year , so it is not dry in the way many reference books are . in fact , mr. osborne 's love of film and its history really shine through in the book . it is interesting to look through this book and see what we consider to be films that have withstood the test of time versus which ones were rewarded by the academy at the time . for example , in 1939 , the academy did recognize that `` gone with the wind '' was the best picture of the year , which people were lining up to watch in movie theaters until its television broadcast premiere in 1976 . however , in 1941 , `` how green was my valley '' won best picture , which is a film that hardly anyone watches anymore , while `` citizen kane '' was completely ignored . it 's also interesting to see how the academy compensated for past oversights by awarding performances that were less than stellar in subsequent years . for instance , in 1934 bette davis was overlooked in her performance in `` of human bondage '' . this caused a huge public outcry . the following year the academy gave her the best actress award for her performance in `` dangerous '' - a move that has largely been seen over the years as a consolation prize for what happened the year before . this book is full of little insights such as these , and it is a fun book that gives hours of entertainment for film history buffs . i bought my first copy of this history by mr. osborne back in 1987 when he was then detailing the 60 years of the oscar , and i enjoyed it so much i have been updating my copy every time he releases a new edition . highly recommended
