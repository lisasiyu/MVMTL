more than just a thriller this is a terrific book on several levels . first , just the love that these two women have for the people of afghanastan and the picture they paint of life under the taliban is interesting in and of itself . in places it reads like a thriller , especially when they are arrested and their daring rescue . finally , just the incredible faith that these women exhibited under such trying circumstances is an inspiration to me . not that they are perfect , and they are the first to admit they struggled at times in those dark hours in prison , even bickering among themselves at times . but in the end , their deep faith prevailed and a miracle occurred . i felt like i was with them before , during and after their imprisonment , and that is a tribute to the great writing of this book . and , by the way , much of the negatives reviews i 've read here sound a lot more like anti-christian bigotry then thoughtful criticisms . ignore them , and buy this inspirational , wonderful book
