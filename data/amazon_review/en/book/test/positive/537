the tears of my father and mother a superb literary work ! when i read carlos 's writings , it brought tears to my eyes . he was writing about my father and mother 's hardships and triumps in the 1950 's livermore and pleasanton area of california . we were one of the first filipino families of that area and my parents worked hard through all the hardships to graduate five children from major california universities . as filipino americans we owe much to the manong generation . many of the manong generation are buried with full military honors . many have fought and died alongside their brothers from the midwest , the south and all over america.it 's a tribute to a proud segment of the greatest generation of america , the wwii generation
