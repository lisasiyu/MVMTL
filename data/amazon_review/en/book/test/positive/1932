'' for me , the most remarkable and beautiful aspect of this book is how it is , itself , a perfect example of `` aloha . '' it 's a memoir , certainly , and much that the author shares is distinctly personal , but her stories are starting points and illustrations - the book immediately expands beyond her own experiences to include many voices . missionaries , journalists , ancient rulers and taro farmers are all heard from . so is the honolulu phone book . every specific recollection opens up to broader thinking : the glamorous rita hayworth pays a visit to the coco palms lodge , or is it the goddess pele incarnate ? this fits right into a discussion of the ancient ways , always right beside you in this place , and delivers us naturally to ideas about the contemporary globalization of traditional hawaiian religion . the book is about life in the 1950 's but it encompasses what came before , and provides a way to understand what came after . for a memoir , this is a very unselfish book . the author has shared her stashed-away candy with us , and it 's a treat
