find out who she really is and get some false media stories corrected ronald kessler has given us a book that is quite pleasant on several levels . first , it is nice to get to know more about the first lady . while all of the wives of the presidents are admired by americans , laura bush is particularly admired and loved . she projects a warmth and intelligence that draws admiration and affection . kessler gives us just enough about her origins to let us know that the calm and strength we see has been there from her beginnings and what her early life was like . her friends recall instances of her calming influence and strength that resonate with what we see in her public appearances . second , we get to see the truly loving and mutually supportive marriage of george and laura . the stories of how they came together , the struggle to have kids and the birth of the twins , their finding their way in life as part of the bush clan , and much more is quite engaging . the picture we get of them as people is quite different than the phony images the media paints of them ( i.e . george likes to read ) . we also learn a couple things about laura that we might find a bit surprising ( i.e . she is still a `` stress smoker '' ) . third , just as we gain a more real image of their marriage , we also get corrective information about false stories about each of them that were touted so loudly during the election . the fatal accident that laura was involved in as a youth , her supposed drug dealing , george 's supposed drug use at camp david , and many more are all cleared up quite specifically . it is great to get the real story from the people who actually know and go on record rather than the gossip and innuendo put forward by kitty kelly and her ilk . kessler has given us a book that reads easily , is not overly fussy in detail , and gives us a portrait that we feel good about and comfortable with . there are several pages of interesting pictures for laura 's life . we come away feeling comfortable with our admiration for her and realize that she is an even better person than we had suspected . good book and one that you should read in order to get a more accurate picture of our first lady and the president
