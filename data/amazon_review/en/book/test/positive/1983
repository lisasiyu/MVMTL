thank you karen houppert ! by page 7 , i was hooked , by page 49 , i was ready to write tha author a letter of thanks . this is not a `` how to be a military wife '' book ! if you want to learn how to read an les , go somewhere else . but , if you want to put the modern military wife into a historical context and see how , sadly , little has changed since the 1940s guides , this is an amazing book . the author starts with a woman who has lost her navy seal husband , and the casualty notification system . then she moves into stories of living on post/base , long deployments , the expectations put on spouses and their behavior , the economics of military life , domestic abuse , ptsd and the struggle for any form of `` outsider '' or person who may not share the views of the majority in the military . this book was a welcome breath of fresh air for any military spouse who gets frustrated with the limitations that a military career can often cause for the `` dependent '' . the stories of women are interwoven with research and statistics effortlessly . again , this is ... well , it is an anthropological study of what it is like to be a woman married to an active duty military member in this day and age , with frequent deployments to the middle east , with the political atmosphere in the us being what it is , and the struggle that comes between the three ends of the triangle described in the book . we 're supposed to step aside and let uncle sam come first in our marriages ... but at what cost ? i think every commander and nco should have this as required reading before they schedule their first frg meeting .
