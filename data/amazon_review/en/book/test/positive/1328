life and death in a virginia colony i first read martin 's hundred when i was in the hospital waiting to give birth to my first child . i managed to stay interested between my labor pains , and that says a lot about mr. hulme 's writing ! i 've re-read it four times since . the archaeological details and interpretations are utterly fascinating , especially those of the pointed-roof coffins and poor & quot ; granny 's hairdo. & quot ; the colonists who inhabited the carter 's grove site really came alive for me . this is an all- time favorite book of mine
