the dark side of the croon a wonderful portrait of the dashing , romantic columbo . virtually forgotten for the last half-century , columbo was as popular as bing crosby in the early 1930s and considered a heart-throb on a par with actor rudolph valentino . but at age 26 , he was shot and killed by his best friend in a freak accident , ending one of the most promising careers in music and film . columbo was the archetypal 1930s `` crooner , '' who gave `` an impression of emotional restraint , of power in reserve . '' despite the co-author credit , the book was in fact written by lanza , a master wordsmith ( and author of elevator music , the cocktail , and gravity ) . penna supplied the copious archival photographs , letters and news clippings that beautifully augment the text . lanza , who calls columbo `` an enigma wrapped inside a press release , '' treats his subject with respect , yet with a proper historical detachment that avoids hagiography . columbo was as talented and charismatic as he was troubled , flawed , ambivalent , and stubborn , and lanza makes no excuses for him . at the same time , the chronology is authoritative , and there 's abundant humor , even when considering columbo 's inner torment ( referring to columbo 's pet name for his adored carole lombard , lanza refers to the singer 's despair at not getting enough `` quality pookie time '' ) . lanza describing columbo emerging from a swimming pool : `` ... a sight no less mythical than venus rising from her half-shell . his dark eyes sparkled as the refracted sunlight grafted a halo around his wet hair , the water pouring like pearls of amniotic effluvia from a chlorinated incubator . '' such vivid images tantalize on every page , but the book never bogs down in literary preciousness ; it represents solid , well-researched journalism . columbo 's love letters to lombard are revealing in their pathetic desperation , demonstrating that the adoration of a million wistful female fans can not allay unrequited passion . an excellent read , and the cast of characters are richly drawn
