offbeat , satirical this book struck me as unique on several levels . first of all it is a serious , thorough examination of the 21st century mafia and stock scams , through the eys of a serial swindler working for the mob . but what really appealed to me about this book was its writing style , which was unique among the mob books i 've read in being offbeat and satirical . it is very unusual to read either a mob or a business book , and this book falls in both categories , that approaches its subject in that manner . you practically have to go back to jimmy breslin , and his gang that could n't shoot straight , to find a less reverential view of the mob . the difference is that breslin was working in fiction and this is a true story . in business , the only parallel is michael lewis ' liar 's poker , which of course delved into an entirely different side of wall street
