one of the marketing classics ! for an student or practitioner of adverstising and marketing , this is a `` must read '' and a personal library staple . yes , the examples may be dated , but the concepts are still operable . you should read their `` positioning : the battle for your mind '' first . though based on von clauswitz ( set piece warfare ) , there is much to be learned . include sun tzu the art of war in your library as well . not that i have an opinion
