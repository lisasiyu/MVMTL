good advice overall this is a great book for anyone in advertising or who is in a lead role or is an entrepeneur . that is what the author is : the head and founder of a leading advertising company or at least what he used to be until he sold the company . i find most of the advice to be legit because i 've been working in corporate america for a long time and i have come across good and bad managers , but mostly bad ones , unfortunately . there are some ideas or values that are obviously his personal preference or it may be just talk so he stands out from other people . i think it is a must-read for anyone in advertising or thinking of starting a business as advertising is a major area if not the most important area that will help drive your business in the right direction . my only caveat about the book is that it is too long . this is somewhat not surprising since the author is not a writer and the writing is not as concised and well-written as if written by someone more professional in the craft
