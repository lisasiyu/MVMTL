wonderful , wonderful , wonderful ! history has not been kind to this man . perhaps it is because he was interpreted as being a `` penny pincher '' or maybe because he was a friend and admirer of adolf hitler . whatever the reason , even though he was at one time the world 's richest man , his triumph seems to have faded into the books . this book is one of them . if i had to pick a favorite book written by a successful businessman , this has to be it . does it tell you how to become a billionaire ? no . what it does teach you is how to succeed , not only financially , but as a person . it explores the creation of his own wealth , as well as valuable lessons from the construction of his vast oil empire . also , it covers the things that are greater than wealth , such as health , charity , and personality . towards the end , it also becomes a sort of social commentary , on man 's degradation of morality and kindess , on the disappearance of art and classical music from the mainstream , and on his general dissatisfaction with similar affairs at that time . it would be difficult to write a thorough review as to why you need to buy this book , because it is so unlike what you have read before . but take my word for it : you will be a better person for reading this book . it may not make you rich , but it will make you wealthy
