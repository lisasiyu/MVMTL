an absolute classic written by frank miller and hauntingly illustrated by david mazzucchelli , year one was serialized in batman # 404-407 . it tells of the first calendar year in which batman emerged in gotham city , beginning with bruce wayne returning to gotham after studying martial arts abroad . wayne becomes a vigilante , at first without the batman outfit , at first fumbling a bit . the sequence in which he conceives of the outfit takes the old clich√© from batman history of a bat crashing through the window and transforms it into a moving moment ; year one gives similar treatment to flashbacks showing the murder of wayne 's parents . in a city dominated by gangsters before the ascent of insane costumed criminals , batman encounters catwoman , here depicted as a whore who takes to the street with frustrations about gender , her sadomasochistic elements heightened . james gordon becomes a fully-realized character for the first time , adjusting from his move from chicago to gotham , where the police force is dominated by corruption . he investigates batman , suspects wayne , has an affair , and ultimately has his child kidnapped and rescued by the vigilante he sought to bring down . in a tough city , he goes from crusader against batman to the first stages of his relationship with batman . a masterful work , batman : year one possesses a level of realism greater than perhaps any batman tale and , with a breakneck pace , does the hard work of describing the humble beginnings of batman 's career , performing in the process a remarkable process of infusing bruce wayne , james gordon , and selina kyle with true character , personality , and history . this is the second best batman story ever made , second only ( perhaps ) to the dark knight returns . -- julian darius , sequart.com ( for sophisticated study of comic books and graphic novels
