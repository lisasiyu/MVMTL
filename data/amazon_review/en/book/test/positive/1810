you ca n't go wrong with nabokov and chess this early nabokov novel is not of the mindbending genius of later works like pale fire and lolita , but it is still better than even the best work by many other writers . nabokov is a brilliant stylist and imagines the world of his protagonist brillantly . the phrasing is sparse and compelling , but as the main character 's mind starts to disintegrate , so does the book . the last third is a bit of a disppotment . a disappointment only because its a nabokov novel , and i 've come to expect such great things for him . its worth the time , especially if you have an interest in chess , but i 'd read his later works first
