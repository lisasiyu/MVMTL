great book ! regardless of some of the negative reviews i found that this book contains some of the best advice you can get about internet marketing . some have their opinions about his book about `` how to get rich by telling other people how to get rich . '' although that has some truth to it , there is so much more to it - if you think of how to apply it in your industry or niche ! what some of these reviewers fail to understand is that this book gives you the strategies on how to market your particular business effectively through using the internet , not just `` teaching people how to get rich . '' and the subtitle to this book accurately says it all , `` making money online using e-mail '' in my opinion that 's what this book is about and is accurately communicated in the title . i highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to start an online business . although you could get most of the material for free on the internet , it 's much more convenient and saves you a lot of time to have this book around .
