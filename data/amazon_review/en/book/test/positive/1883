universal , accessible , and powerful ! i thought this was an absolutely beautiful book . hansberry had such a gift for writing about the human spirit . i hope that the students who say they got nothing from reading this book come back to it as adults and give it another try . i found it to be inspiring . it will definitely join my list of favorites
