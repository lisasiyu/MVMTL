negroponte agrees ... `` and so ? i know : extrapolating bandwidth , processor speed , network dimensions , or the shrinking size of electromechanical devices has become truly tiresome . moore 's law , first expounded by gordon moore in 1965 , is indeed a stroke of brilliance , but one more mention of it should make you puke . terabit access , petahertz processors , planetary networks , and disk drives on the heads of pins will be ... they 'll just be . face it - the digital revolution is over . '' -- nicholas negroponte , 12/98 maybe this will silence some of the recent critics who 've been tearing into this book . yes , this stuff was actually interesting at one point , but we 've heard too much about it at this point . i own the book , and enjoy re-reading it occasionally ( *very* occasionally ) when i have nothing better to do , just to get some perspective on how things looked in 1995 . seems like a century ago , does it not ? things change so fast in the digital age that books like this are doomed to obscurity 6 months after they 're published . but in my opinion perspective on the past can be priceless , because knowing where we 've been helps us figure out where to go next .
