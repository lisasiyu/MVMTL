great book about great books for an avid reader like myself , it 's often tough to know what to read next . in this book , nancy pearl helped me get quite a few suggestions . the book is helpfully broken up into little chapters about different genres or subjects , such as action heroines . i found it great , because if i 'm not interested in that particular subject , i can just skip to the next section . the only thing that prevented me from giving this book 5 stars was that the summaries about the books are way too short . i really could n't tell whether i 'd like the book or not until i had come and read a few of the book 's reviews on amazon . all in all , this is a marvelous book , chock full of great suggestions for the casual and avid reader . i recommend it wholeheartedly
