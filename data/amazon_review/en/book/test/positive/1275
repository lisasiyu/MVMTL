great overview of the industry , but ... dr. dichter gives a wide range of examples based on real experiences that expose many of the pitfalls of development assistance as we know it . unfortunately , while his descriptions of the problems are quite comprehensive , his proposed solution ( i.e . drastically cut development assistance in favor of private development ) lacks much in the way of logical support . for instance , there is no contrasting presentation of examples of privately-funded projects that have succeeded where charity has failed , nor any mention of to what extent business relies on government-funded infrastructure improvements , etc . in addition , the topic is best addressed in two stages -- i.e. , is it desirable to encourage development in other countries ? and , if so , are our current tactics the most effective and efficient ways to achieve this goal ? dr. dichter addresses only the second question , but seems to conclude that because the status quo is ineffective , the entire pursuit should be abandoned . but in general the book is still highly worth reading if you 're the least bit interested in development assistance -- it is both deeply enlightening and generally accessible .
