this was my favorite story when ... this was my favorite story when i was a child . i love how it tells of a young girl who chooses to give up something she loves for her family and people ... i read this book whenever i could in school . now that i teach pre school i get to share the beauty of this story with my class and they love it too ... in texas you see them everywhere in late march to early may . i use to think it was funny but now i have to wonder why , when you see a bluebonnet an indian paintbrush is n't that far away
