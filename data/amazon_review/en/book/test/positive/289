a well written memoir of the horrors of war . i find it quite interesting the one reader who slams le ly is also the only reader in all of these posts who neglected to leave a name or email address . also the following statement was included `` the viet congs lied , tortured , and killed numerous innocent people to get what they want . '' hmmmm that sounds like the exact same things the americans did ! also the following statement is made `` it 's pathetic how low she would go to make a buck off the same capitalist system that she and the communists despised do much that they had to engage in a war that turned many people 's lives upside down , to drive the americans out '' that 's kinda funny accusing the vietnamese of starting a war because it 's likely there never would have been a war had americans stayed in america . the vietcong were no more worse human beings than the americans they were fighting against . the vietcong were true patriots no different than american patriots and visitors to vietnam today will find many ex-vietcong are friendly and civil to american visitors . a good book with one more account of how innocent people are effected by the war
