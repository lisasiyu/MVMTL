great so far i have only read 60 or so pages so far , but as other readers have accounted , i have a difficult time putting the book down . it reads like a hollywood movie , i have to snap myself to attention every-so-often to remind myslef that these accounts are true to life , that these things actually happened , which makes it even more gripping . the way the author goes from the experiences of the ghost soldiers and the prisoners on the death march is perfectly mixed . nicely done
