very mysterious ! dr. alex delaware is invited to take a job on the island of aruk , by the mysterious dr.moreland . shortly into his assigned tasks , alex discovers some very odd cases that the mysterious dr. has treated in the past . one of these cases was a man who claims to have seen `` worm people '' . as dr. delaware tries to unravel these mysterious cases , a brutal murder occurs on the island of aruk . alex inquires of dr. moreland about the islands history , and dr. moreland is very vague in his response . as the climax of this novel approaches , alex finds cryptic messages left for him by the then missing dr. moreland . robin is very much a main character in this story . however , if you are a big fan of milo ( as i am ) , you may be dissapointed because his character plays a minor part in this novel . i give this story 4 stars , because it is not one of my favorite kellerman stories . i thought the ending was a little silly
