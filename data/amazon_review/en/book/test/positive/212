inspirational i was given this book recently and have to say it is probably the most inspirational travel book i have seen for many years . as a founder of an adventure travel company ( intrepid travel ) i see many books of this ilk - but this is altogether different and better . the pictures are fantastic and the copy very rreadable . it looks at 40 destinatiions - some mainstream , some off the beaten track . it makes you want to travel
