three thums up ! while browsing aimlessly at a local bookstore , this title caught my eye . just coming off of an enjoyable & quot ; wandering hill & quot ; read , i was primed for more hardscrabble , tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning . that 's exactly what i got . this book is very & quot ; readable & quot ; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning , brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge . do i care if it is historically accurate ? no . my only gripe is that the book should be longer . then again , any more page volume would have killed hugh glass before his time , so maybe it is the right length ! get this book and enjoy
