i was awakended with this book ! dolores did a great at job interviewing phil in her studies , i found myself realizing that it all makes sense . the historcal gaps in history seemed to be filled with his recounts of earths of civilization thousands of years ago . not a typical abduction case , but a true eye opener . i related to many things in the book and feel that so much has been confirmed with me . i ca n't wait for a follow-up with phil . personally i ca n't wait to read it again
