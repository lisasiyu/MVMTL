good overview for the uninitiated . the book is not intended for students of akkadian as there is no cuneiform or transcripted akkadian . everything is in translation . the book centers around the enuma elish ( the biggest creation account ) , but has many other smaller creation legends . there is a synopsis of the elish as well as various theories about its dating , composition , etc . there is also a lengthy ( 58 page ) article showing parallels to the old testament creation account . the author does a good job of being objective , but leans toward showing the uniqueness of the genesis account and contrasts it quite a bit against the remaining semitic literature
