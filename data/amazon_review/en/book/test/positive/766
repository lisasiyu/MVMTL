silly ( satirical ) look at a very serious subject . when i first started reading this book , the story seemed so outlandish that it all seemed too silly . soon , though , i realized that it was a satirical look at a serious subject ( censorship ) and that the humor was actually a very effective way of getting the point across . the story is told in letters , predominantly between 19-yo cousins tassie and ella but occasionally in letters from or to their parents , neighbors and the nazi-like town council that begins prohibiting the use of letters of the alphabet as they fall from their hero 's statue ( nollop , inventor of the sentence `` the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog . '' -- of note because it contains every letter of the english alphabet ) . the idea that a government , especially one in a society as literate and as committed to honoring the english language as this one , would strangle its citizens with such laws is ludicrous ; it is not only interesting but amusing to see how the community deals with the laws and their effects . first , like sheep being led to slaughter and , later , taking charge of their own destinies . i found ella minnow pea a very quick and enjoyable read . it is light and funny but yet gives you something to think about . if you are a fan of language , you will likely enjoy it . it is rare that i come across a book that has a word in it with which i am not familiar ; this book contained many words unfamiliar to me -- a truly impressive level of vocabulary ( though some words were , i think , coined by the islanders as a way of dealing with the prohibited letters ) . i recommend this book -- especially for those who , like i , are concerned about the direction our society is taking in terms of censorship
