a quick read , but not her best i 've read almost all of danielle steel 's books and i do n't think i 've ever bought one brand new . i usually get them at half price books for $ 2- $ 4 . this one caught my eye at the store when it first came out and after reading the summary in the back cover , i bought it . its a quick read , i got through it in only a few days . its a more diverse storyline than she 's presented in the past , but the ending just was n't believable . most of steel 's books end with a `` happy ending '' and although most of us want that , sometimes it just does n't make sense . the `` meat and potatoes '' of this book revolves around the tragedy that befalls a once-wealthy family . the introduction of the 'bad guys ' , the buildup of the plot , the execution and then finally the resolution . it seems that with 100 pages to go , steel wants to toss in a romance . does n't work ! she does n't build the romance at all , not in a believable way anyway . it seems one minute she 's talking about a cop who 's been with his wife for 17 years and `` he 'll never leave her '' and the next thing you know ... a week later he 's in love with someone else ! did n't like the ending , does n't make sense . this book could have taken about another 100 pages to draw that out , and that 's something we did n't need . wait for it in the bargain bin
