excellent summary of studio casting techniques this book , like mccreight 's other books on working metals , divides the subject into easily digestible portions and treats each topic separately ( often on a separate page ) with a short discussion . line drawings help clarify important points . the focus is on the tools , materials , and techniques of lost wax casting , but also covers sand casting , the use of flexible molds , using the services of a foundry , and other topics of concern to the studio metalsmith . it 's a great reference tool if you need to look up the proper sequence to use in a particular technique , or a formula for making your own crucibles . learning to cast almost requires hands-on instruction , and this book alone can not provide that . but if you 're already familiar with casting , it 's a wonderful reference
