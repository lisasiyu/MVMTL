planning , not just plans unlike most business plan guides that focus on producing an impressive document , this book actually helped me plan to run a company . it anticipates and explains virtually every potential pitfall for a company-builder . the book transforms the business planning process into something that you can and should use every day . it touches all aspects of analyzing your business and deciding where to go next . i highly recommend it
