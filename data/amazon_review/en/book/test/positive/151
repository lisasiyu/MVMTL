captivating global spy thriller - but ludlum died in 2001 ; who 's actual author ? this is as exciting and convoluted as any of the master 's thrillers ; prior reviewers have detailed the story sufficiently . i 'll only add that the plot 's twists , turns and surprises continue right on up to the final paragraph in the epilogue . although i enjoyed the story immensely , i had the sense that the action scenes lacked the `` ludlum strategy '' of realism and credibility [ after all , how can many times can one super-agent overwhelm four or more opponents singlehandedly ; or one untrained woman knock out two professional killers ? ] . on checking the book 's front pages , i learn that the 'ludlum estate ' ( the author died 12-mar-01 in naples , fl ) commissioned a `` qualified author and editor '' ; the unanswered question remains whether this book -- prominently displaying ludlum 's name -- is an updated previously unpublished manuscript , a thriller developed from a premortem story outline , or whether the commissioned author wrote this book singlehandedly . if this is indeed an original de-novo piece of writing , then the true author deserves not only a great deal of credit , but ought to publish under his/her own name rather than remain anonymous ; s ( he ) would make a genuine contribution as an independent , skilled and accomplished writer of thrillers . i have the uncomfortable gut sense that this ship may be flying under a false flag ... unless and until the authorship provenance is more fully clarified
