one of my favorites i recently became interested in gardening ( now that i have a yard in which i can plant ) . this is one of my favorite books on gardening and landscaping . great resource for those of us living in the northeast . full of wonderful photos , explanations and illustrations . it gives many ideas for addressing certain areas of your yard ( i.e . front entryway , patio , rock wall ) . explanations are excellent ; i learned a great deal from this book . very well written . highly recommended
