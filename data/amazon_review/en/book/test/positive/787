not my favorite perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is the reaction to it by various readers . those who detested it said it was because of the violence . those who like it apparently liked it because it was by nora roberts . there are the usual nora roberts fixtures here : a beautiful , independent , tough heroine ; r-rated sex scenes ; handsome and talented lovers ; flowers , etc . it has been touted by some as a mystery of sorts , but there 's nothing very mysterious about it . anyone who does n't know who the arsonist is after the first fire has n't paid much attention . in fact , i kept wanting to tell reena to wake up and go get him . perhaps the biggest departure from ms. roberts ' previous books ( for me , at least ) is the rather humdrum atmosphere . ambience is the writer 's strongest suit in other works -- alaska in winter , an island off boston , chesapeake bay , ireland , louisiana etc . old baltimore neighborhoods and a pizza shop are n't quite the same . still , the writing is mostly good and i kept reading . a second-rate nora roberts book is still more interesting than most other novels being published today
