i 'm a big margaret coel fan i find life among the arapaho as she describes it infinitely fascinating , and wish she would spend more time on that than she does . she 's very good in her description of the setting , also , and i can easily imagine myself on the wyoming reservation . this is the umpteenth book in the series ( 10th ? ) in which a jesuit priest ( who is with the st. francis mission ) and his friend , an arapaho attorney , solve mysteries on the reservation . the plot in this series is two-fold ( turn of the 20th century and early 21st century ) and revolves around an old photograph by curtis on display in the mission 's museum . the photo depicts a staged attack on a phony arapaho village . in the course of shooting that photo , a woman was killed , so some chapters describe the events around this historic murder , while others describe some present day crimes that appear to be linked to the curtis photographs in some way . a woman is murdered and her husband is the chief suspect , but on the same night , the newly-hired curator at the museum disappears . then there 's the visit from the senator who may be declaring himself as a candidate for president -- how does that tie in ? coel is an excellent writer , although she makes some blunders that a fact-checker or good editor could help her with . like all the other states , for example , wyoming has two senators , not a sole representative in washington , and it is highly unlikely that a person who has only been curator for a month would have had time to mount an exhibition , particularly one that involves borrowing materials from another collection . these things take years , not weeks . so -- i think perhaps ms. coel is under pressure to keep turning these best-selling books out and that 's a pity , because this is quite a good book in other respects . coel is a great story teller . i 'm also happy to see that the unrequited love theme between the priest and the lawyer is being downplayed
