a resource for true students of tolkien the variety of material available in 'the war of the jewels ' is what makes this volume of the history of middle-earth series one of the best . two things stand out . first is the extensive writings on hurin after his release from angband . in an extension and more fully recounted version of his tale , hurin 's character and the consequences of his release are more fully explored , giving greater depth to the account given in 'the silmarillion ' . the other is the essay 'quendi and eldar ' . this is a treasure-trove not only for the tolkien linguist but anyone interested in the history of the elves . through an examination of the different words used by the elves to refer to themselves and their different divisions , the look at their history as they themselves saw it is priceless . other parts of the essay and accompanying material fill out references found in 'unfinished tales ' , etc . 'the war of the jewels ' has many stories worth reading on their own that are great examples of the depth and the layers of the legendarium
