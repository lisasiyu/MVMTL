all history is biased these concerns about this historical account of mao being biased are naive and foolish . all accounts of past and present events and people are biased because that is the nature of how the controlling / ruling elite record what other members of the elite have done or are currently doing . very little of the truth can be widely distributed , otherwise the elite would be ousted before dawn . this reminds me of a quote by bush sr. in 1992 where he says that if americans ever knew what the bush family had done over the years to america that they would be chased down in the streets and lynched . exactly . thus , most outlets for information ( especially book publishing , and especially books used to teach history ) are censored with a fine tooth comb . in point of fact , historical accounts that are closer to the truth will always come across as bizarre , horrific , and unbelievable to all of us who have been conditioned by our `` education '' . for example , any book on hitler and the nazis that does not delve into the blatant satanism , occultism , `` bull '' homosexuality and fascination with the ancients ( ie . egypt , atlantis , and others ) is way off course , especially in trying to piece together what happened and why . of course , this constant throwing us off course is intentional and very well thought out . also , people like hitler , stalin , mao and others are not `` self-made '' , or randomly evil , or `` in the right place at the right time '' like this book claims , rather they are bred , groomed , trained , and then placed into positions of power in order to achieve specific agendas ( sometimes unknown to even them ) . hard to believe ? there is one place that all of the above mentioned mass murderers can be tied to : the tavistock institute of london . research this yourselves . these monsters are created , and although they may be born of flesh and blood in small towns in china , austria , russia , texas , arkansas , etc. , they quickly become nothing like the rest of us and do not consider themselves patriots of any nation . so , killing us is enjoyable to them , raping and causing us misery is sport to them , and lying about it in the history books is hardly an after-thought . therefore , does this book go over-board with brutal details ? i would think not at all and i am sure there are many stomach retching accounts of depravity that were not told . i have read other accounts of breeding children specifically to sacrifice and then eat ( yes , i am refering to canibalism ) . sometimes , children were / are eaten alive after having been sexually violated and skinned so their terror is at an absolute peak . this was in mao 's regime and many others historically . what is really going on here ? ! just coincidence ? my major critique of this work is not recognizing mao as a well made product by the hidden hands that control this planet . he was no random peasant who cut his own swath through the masses and then appeared on the world stage at just the right time . human history does not unfold that way , regardless of what you may have read .
