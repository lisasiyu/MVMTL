ok for starters . a good beginner 's book for those interested in building their own speakers without getting into heavy mathematics , passive electronics , complex woodworking , or folded horns . the book explains some the rudiments of speaker theory , and barely enough to design your own simple crossover network . the book has several economical projects which the author already debugged and are ready to build , including : the make and model of the speakers , list of passive components , schematic - which usually include extras like a zobel network , and the cabinet dimensions . their are several two-way projects and one three-way with a ten-inch woofer . most designs use a soft-dome tweeter , if that 's what you like . there is a list of raw component vendors in the back of the book . the designs for the ported boxes use the thiel method , and i am finding that this may be conservatively sized toward the large side with respect to a flat bass response . the prose is a bit wordy , but still easy to read . overall , i have learned a few things from this book
