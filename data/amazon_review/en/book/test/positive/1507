great book this was a great addition to the series . i love the way anne bishop writes i could read her books over and over . the book had a great blend of humor and suspense . i wanted more storyline on some of the characters but the book seemed to drop them . ari was not in this book much which was too bad , i like her character . the book left an opening for another book or a spinoff . if there is no plan to write another book i will be disappointed because there are some characters i would like to follow up on
