unanticipated anne shirley back in action ! red haired with a flaming temper , the phenomenal anne shirley is back in her 2nd book ! marilla , a kindly old maid who had set heart on bringing anne up ( when she was an orphan ) has decided to also adopt two adorable little twins , davy and dora keith . anne is absolutely thrilled but adopting these twins causes big trouble . davy is really a good boy at heart but always finds himself into scrapes : like making his sister dora walk the pig fence ! davy ? ? s idea of fun includes violence and humor ? v but only for himself . the girls have to teach davy manners , which is a difficult task for such a cheeky little boy . anne ? ? s problems grow even more as she takes up responsibility of being a schoolteacher and suddenly feels very timid again , but she has to pull up her socks and jerk herself back into the adult world . at school , she regains her impertinence temper and broad imaginations as she shares happy times with her students , especially paul irving , this sweet little kid with brown hair and the most delightful face she has ever seen . he brings her flowers and calls her ? ? sweet teacher ? ? . her friendship with striking gilbert blythe ( ex-enemy for calling her hair ? ? carrots ? ? ) has grown , but what is gilberts real reason of being so sweet and pleasant ? has diana ( her bosom friend ) finally grown up ? i really enjoyed this book because it talks about anne growing up and finding her place in the adult world leaving her wonderful childhood behind forever . i simply couldn ? ? t put it down because after every page , anne has another adventure so it is like a cliffhanger . my mom keeps telling me to go and do work but i can not stop because this is the most wonderful book ever written . i like the others in this series also.thank you l.m . montgomery for bringing a bright light into my life ! ~~ referring to the special collectors editio
