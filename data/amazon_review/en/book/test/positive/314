a must-read this is , without doubt , the most incredible book i have ever read . it may completely change your opinions on foreign policy or may reinforce what you already believe , but it is sure to generate some response and some discussion . sharansky respectfully tells it like it is : when politicians have been wrong , why they 've been wrong , and what they should have done differently . his governmental criticism transcends party lines , and even sharansky himself , a jew and a member of numerous israeli cabinets , says that a palestinian state is the only way israel will have peace . this book is everything you 'd expect with everything you would n't - read it
