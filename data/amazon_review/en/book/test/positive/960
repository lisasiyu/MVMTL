boy the way glenn miller played , books that are a hit today ! i thought while reading this book how thoroughly done it was . i thought about how much i loved all in the family , how connected i felt to each character , how i identified with mike , gloria , edith and even archie . how real it was to me . when a piece of literature , brings back all of those feelings and memories , it is something to remember . pictures , stories , archie-isms and an episode guide are just a few things that make up this book . i recommend it to all archie bunker fans and haters alike . this book is one of the best documentations of characters you love to hate , that i have ever come across
