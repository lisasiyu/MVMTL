laffertarian bedtime reading the best take i 've read on lafferty is from john clute 's encyclopaedia of fantasy . he echoes the view that r.a. lafferty is his own man , and you 've got to read all of him to even start to know what he 's about . someone new to lafferty would be better off starting with fourth mansions or past master or reefs of earth or the many volumes of short stories . those books make some concessions to the general reader , while this one decidedly does not . thanks to wildside press for making this novel available . i had looked for a long time for a `` new '' lafferty novel and could only find more short stories . nothing against those ; i read his stories avidly before ever cracking the cover of a novel , but i enjoy it when lafferty stretches out in a full-length work and invites us into his universe . serpent 's egg takes place in the indeterminate future of 2035 when all sorts of experiments are taking place between animals , humans and humanoid computers , resulting in various hybrid offspring . these mega-persons all reach maturity at ten years old , but should they prove to be a serpent 's egg , a threat to the `` floating world '' , assassins are sent after them by the kangaroo court , seen as a portent in the sky of a kangaroo . the offspring of four experiments join up to form a magic twelve , including in their number a psychic python , an unborn elephant , a wolverine , a bear , a computer , and a few humans . it 's all very laffertarian and it probably does n't give anything away to say that the epilog ( written by a whale ) claims that half the book is lies . i had a copy of wildside press ' collection of lafferty stories , iron tears , which had a lot of typos in it . it may have since been edited , however , since my edition does n't have the introduction by michael swanwick included in the newer edition . regardless , this book has few typos and is well-produced . it 's also as much reading as a whole book of short stories , just right for laffertarian bedtime reading .
