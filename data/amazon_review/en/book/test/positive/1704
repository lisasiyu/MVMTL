the best book i 've ever read ! before i read this book , i was a fanatic of the movie bambi . i still am , but it 's very different from the book and it seems like 15 minutes after you read the book . i could see everything that was described in the text of the book . it really has an effect on emotions . some things are lighthearted , some things are truly heart breaking , there 's even a few laughs . everything is described in much detail . i felt like , at one point , that i was bambi running for the first time in the meadow , drinking in the warm air . i could hear the dogs barking , the hoofbeats , and the gunshots . i highly recommend it to nature lovers and fans of the film . now i just need to read bambi 's children
