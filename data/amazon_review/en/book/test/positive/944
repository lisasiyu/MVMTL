a good book on fencing this is one of the best books on fencing writen by an american . it 's major weakness is that it often attempts to teach both foil and epee and the same time . the author does address modern fencing , a subject often ingored . this book is good for the person that knows how to fence and wants some pointers ; not a good read for beginners . a good book but kept me wanting more , for example the author tells nothing of how she took up the sport and what it 's done for her . close only 4 of 5 stars
