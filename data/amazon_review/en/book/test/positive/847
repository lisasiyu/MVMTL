why care about the future ? postrel forces you to think explicitly about the future . i have 10 children . thus i have more invested in the future than most people . the future my children and grandchildren inherit and create be mostly shaped by people with dynamist views . after all , it is the dynamists who created civilization . to be sure , history is full of examples where the forces of stasis won over the dynamists , sometimes for centuries . however , i think the future is with the dynamists . i 'm betting this book will be considered a seminal classic 100 years from now .
