literalism vs . essence `` the tao can be told is not the eternal tao . '' so you see , mitchell goes about the impossible task of translating and telling us about something that ca n't be told . if you understand this , you understand why rather than a literal interpretation , he chooses instead ( and succeeds , in my opinion ) in capturing the essence . it 's hard for me to imagine anyone not liking this book but to each his own . as for me , i rate it as excellent without any qualifications
