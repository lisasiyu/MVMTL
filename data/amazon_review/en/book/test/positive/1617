if they take you in the morning i remember the first time i realized that james baldwin was a genius . i picked up one of angela davis 's autobiographies . i found one of the most beautifully crafted letters ever exchanged from one writer to another . and with one five page letter , i fell in love . i am certain that the price of the ticket must be one of the greatest collections of essays ever bound into a single volume . if someone would like to challenge that , please be my guest . and , i believe that james baldwin is probably the second most widley quoted african american writer in epithets , speeches and dedications after martin luther king . i admit , i have no statistical data to support these claims . i have no quantitative proof . just keep your eyes and ears open and you will understand what i mean . whether it was the text many thousands gone i read in an african history course on slavery , or the article entitled the price of the ticket that i discovered in my art history course . baldwin has left an indelible mark on history . james warned us that , `` it is very nearly impossible , after all , to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind . '' ( the ca n't turn back ) he proved to us that , `` freedom is not something that anybody can be given ; freedom is something people take and people are as free as they want to be . '' ( notes for a hypothetical novel ) long before morrison & cose explanation of the envy of the world we knew , `` alas , that to be an american negro male is also to be a kind of walking phallic symbol : which means that one pays , in one 's own personality , for the sexual insecurity of others . '' ( the black boy looks at the white boy ) before mumia reminded us baldwin informed us , `` what passes for identity in america is a serise of myths about one 's heroic ancestors . it 's astounding to me , for example that so many people really appear to believe that the country was founded by a band of heroes who wanted to be free . '' ( a talk to teachers ) and years later we still have not grasped the fact that , `` guilt is a luxury we can no longer afford . '' ( words of a native son ) perhaps genovese was smiling when baldwin wrote , `` we won our christianity , our faith , at the point of a gun , not because of the example afforded by white christains , but in spite of it . it was very difficult to become a christian if you were a black man on a slave ship , and the slave ship was called `` the good ship jesus . '' perhaps the scarriest thing that baldwin has showed us , is how seldom things change . any writer , i suppose , feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent . talent is not to be ignored . dreams are to be followed , challenges are to be faced and art is to be created .
