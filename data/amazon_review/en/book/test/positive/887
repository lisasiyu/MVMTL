my favorite harry potter volume ... after purposely avoiding the entire harry potter frenzied bandwagon , i finally gave in . my curiosity was peaked following a news story i saw in regards to some folks burning harry potter books in protest . i had to find out what exactly the fuss was about . knowing nothing about the books i randomly picked up the prisoner of azkaban , actually the third book in the series by j.k. rowling . the minute i picked it up , i could n't put it back down and read the entire book and continued on to its two predecessors . i had joined the potter bandwagon . the story starts the same as each with harry spending the summer at his dreadful aunt & uncle 's house before returning to another year at magic boarding school - hogwarts - where he is learning to be a wizard . in this , his third year at hogwarts , harry , now 13 , is a teenager and all the complications that accompany that stage of life on top of discovering there is an escaped prisoner from the wizard prison azkaban rumored to be pursuing him . of course , the story is n't as simple as that . for the first time , we get a real look into harry 's past and the greater , darker story unraveling of harry 's connection to the evil lord voldemort that will run the remainder of the series . even with the impeding moments of doom , life saving time travel and frightening shadowy dementor 's lurking about , the story is n't entirely angst filled . there are plenty of humorous moments originating from normal awkward coming of age relationships and experiences . from harry 's two best friends constant bickering to discovering girls and a map of secret passages that leads to plenty of trouble and humor along the way . when harry is warned escaped azkaban prisoner is after him , harry prioritizes like most normal teenagers by focusing on what is really important - sports ! whatever lofty expectations the surrounding wizard community puts on him , harry does n't view himself as that hero . his story is much like cinderella 's story or the little princess by frances hodgson burnett . like sara , harry finds his fortune , who his parents were , and his new guardian , but his troubles are not solely with his wicked step family or a money hungry orphanage keeper . throughout harry & sara stay true to the people who have stood by them thru hardship . they remember the true friendship and mercy from the few that bestowed it . as a result of harry being rather new to the wizard world , he is naï¿½ve to the fear inspired by lord voldemort or rather `` you-know-who '' as the magic community refers to him as . this allows harry to speak with a boldness that challenges the adults in his world to face a fear they do n't wish to acknowledge . harry sees the truth of what is to come , what they refuse to see ; lord voldemort 's return . in the secret garden , also by burnett , mary lennox comes to mind . while she was not as humble or endearing initially as harry or sara , with her obstinate & stubborn curiosity she helps the adults in her world to face the fears literally crippling the one thing they were trying so hard to protect . as harry unravels his parent 's death , in the process he brings to light the truth of those comfortable deceptions the adults in his world have chosen to believe ; but understanding and acceptance does not come quickly . and as with all the harry potter series the magic jargon and side stories fabulously set the stage and draw you into its world . harry 's world is n't the idealistic fairy tale where everyone lives happily ever after . becoming a wizard does n't give harry a perfect life nor does it return his parents , which is the one thing his heart aches for . it is what makes harry a relatable and loveable character throughout the series . there are seven books total in this series by rowling , not including a few fictional hogwart 's text books written as supplements . six of the books are currently published with rowling working on the final book due out in 2007 . you wo n't find me in line at the midnight release for the highly anticipated finale , but i will be preordering ! it is a great fairy tale with boundless imagination and humor for all ages
