i was hesitant ... i was hesitant to read this because of it being on the supernatural side , but my friend encouraged me to read a couple of chapters befor making up my mind , and i am so glad she did . it is one of the best books i have read . even if you do n't buy into the whole ghost thing , i think that most will still love this book . before you know it , you are totally wrapped up in it -- i could n't put it down !
