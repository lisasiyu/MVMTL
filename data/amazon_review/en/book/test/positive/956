a look into the impossible life of a preacher 's wife ... . an unhappily married and mistreated preacher 's wife lets us in on the sad and lonely existence of a pastor 's wife . king did a good job of showing how pastors ' wives are expected to please and perform at inhuman levels . i was n't happy with the ending ( dean 's tawrdriness seemed out of character ) ; i wish she could have left on her own terms , rather than being basically run out of town . her behavior lessened the reader 's pleasure in seeing pious , ambitious , ben 's probable career nomination nix . augusta 's manic personality was enjoyable and needed for the story ; sometimes it takes a `` big '' personality to help us break old habits and get out of ruts and she did that for dean . a good read , just wish dean could have finally told ben and the church what she really thought of them , left town , and then figured out her relationship with maddox ... in an above-board kind of way . dean deserved to leave that snake pit with her head held high , not running with her tail between her legs
