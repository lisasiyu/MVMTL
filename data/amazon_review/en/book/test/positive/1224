delicious ! well , lmb did it again . she completely beguiled me ! she has created yet a third universe , after the vorkosigan nexus and the world of chalion , and it is a really plausible fantasy . she introducted the notion of `` ground '' , a mysterious life-force that pervades everything , from humans , through mosquitoes and fireflies , down to rocks , glass bowls and shards thereof , and can be perceived by the lakewalkers `` groundsense '' . and this notion is very central to the plot ( `` ground '' comes so early that mentioning it is not a spoiler ) . so certainly the book is a fantasy , and quite a well-constructed one . it is also romance , and a very sweet romance it is . of course , it is not a book , just half of one . the ending is not an end , you really are left waiting for the second half . but the cutting point is well-chosen , i think i 'll survive till `` legacy '' comes out on july 1st . but just barely..
