american zen begins brad warner is truly an inspiring young man . i have read his book , recommend it to others ; met him , recommend him to others , and wonder how long the cobwebs will remain in american zendos with this book flying around . zen is a lived and envolving experience . warner shows us how we can take a culture and integrate it with another , finding value in each , yet creating a new culture in the process . zen is icoloclastic reverence . on the floor are pieces of the trappings of zen . the zen remain and is vibrant as a result . the best recommendation ? my daughter , the ph.d. scientist , loved it . so daiho-rosh
