the very best carol berg , in my humble opinion , is the very best living writer of `` dependable '' fantasy ... i.e . nothing that offends my sensibilities , but transports me to a place i 'd like to be , filled with people i 'd like to know . while i consider each of her books i 've had the privilege to read as safe territory , her characters are anything but safe , each generally beat to a pulp one or more times in each story line . some would consider this violence excessive , but it always moves the story forward and promotes the philosophy of pain and hardship 's place in selflessness . a lost concept in the cocoon of ease and comfort in which most of us dwell . daughter of ancients delivers all the promise of the preceding bridge of d'arnath books . it is satisfying , suspenseful , rich and so very human ... with the delightful tendency of carol berg to often surprise us thoroughly and tie her plot lines together without the too-tidy endings that so many authors fall into . thank you , carol , for the gift of your imagination and the concise nature of your beautiful writing
