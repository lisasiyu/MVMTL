what can i say ... . i purchased , `` a second treasury of knitting patterns , and is most pleased . the book is thorough and well written . i love how barbra walker 's guides you through some of the more challenging stitches . this book is the definitive on stitches . some people complain about the black and white pictures . it does n't bother me a bit , it allows me the creativity to imagine what my color selections will look like . every knitter should own the book . i am so glad that the book was re-released . thanks to the publishers
