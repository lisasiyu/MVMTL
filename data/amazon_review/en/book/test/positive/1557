one of her best ! could n't put it down ! i have read several of barbara michaels ' books and have to say that this may actually be the best one i have read ! i borrowed it from the library and was so entranced by the story that i read it in one day . now i plan to purchase a copy from amazon for a place on my bookshelf - which is n't that easy to qualify for ! only the very best books gain a place there . and this book is a great one
