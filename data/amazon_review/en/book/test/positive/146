awsome ! ! ! ! ! this was the first nora roberts book that i had read and it is now , i think , my most favorite book i have ever read . i have never been interested in reading a romance before , but this struck me as being different and it was ! it has romance in it difinately ... very good romance i might add ... but it is a thriller ! i could n't put it down and i 'm not kidding ! i read this book in a week and it normally takes me close to a month because i just do n't have that much time to read . i found my self making time to read this book ! it is very graphic with the murders , rapes and animal killings , but reading that kind of stuff does n't really bother me . it 's seeing it in a movie that i ca n't handle . but i think nora roberts knew what she was doing by making it so graphic . you just want to kill this guy , and you find yourself prying your eyes open even when your exhausted and want to go to bed just to see if maybe on the next page you figure out who this guy is . not only is the suspense awsome , but her characters are great . you just really get involved with them and really feel what they feel . i loved reading about the girls learning to run a ranch , ride horses , and heard cattle and stuff like that . everything about the book is just awsome !
