an excellent book for indians born in usa i saw this book for the very first time , while browsing through a book store in london heathrow airport . honestly , what caught my eyes is the name of the book . unlike all other books i read about hinduism , this book is very simple . i read the whole book during my flight from london to new york . this book answered all my questions i had about my culture my culture as well as my religion . i also learned so aspects of christianity also from this book . the book also helped me to answer all type of questions my christian friends ask me . now when they ask me , `` why hindus worship many gods ? '' i can answer them , `` hindus worship the one and only god - brahman which express itself in many forms . '' when they ask me , `` why hindus worship idols ? '' i can answer them , `` like every one else , including christians , hindus use idols or icons to concentrate on god who has no name or form . '' i can also tell them that hindus believe that every person who search after truth will attain salvation [ self-realization ] irrespective of whether he or she is a hindu or christian or moslem . am i a hindu ? is indeed a book for indians born in the west who are desperately trying to learn about their faith . in short , am i a hindu ? is a great book for anyone who wants to know everything about hinduism . an amazing book without any dogma or demagoguery .
