if you are interested in early american furniture , read this having been sent this book as a present by a friend in the us , i felt i must tell others just what a treasure trove it is . it has been written by someone who not only obviously loves his subject , but who has written a clear , easy-to-read amd well-illustrated guide for those of us who have developed an interest in early american furniture but who lacked expertise . it also tells you how to care for furniture . i ca n't recommend it highly enough
