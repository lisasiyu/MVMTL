very interesting mystery this is the first molly blume mystery i 've read , and i really enjoyed it -- enough that i will probably go back and read the earlier ones , to find out how molly got to where she is . as an orthodox jew , i 'm impressed with the accuracy and understatement of ms. krich 's depiction of modern orthodox jews -- it 's so accurate , without painting the lifestyle as the source of all ills or the source of all happiness as a lot of other writers try to do . i 'm also looking forward to the next book . there are some hints in this one of molly 's possible infertility , and i really hope the author delves into that -- having her deal with fertility issues and treatments rather than just providing a miraculous baby . it 's such an important topic , especially within the orthodox world . i would love to see how molly deals with it
