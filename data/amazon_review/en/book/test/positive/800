pretty good read . leaves out lots of the details . i like the overall point of this book . i also agree with a lot of the stuff he teaches in regards to using real estate and owning your own business as the only true way to get superb rates of returns . however , he does make one huge assumption in the real estate section that is not clear : that you can rent a house for the same cost as your expenses . this may work in some cheaper areas , but in the places where houses have skyrocketed in price , expecting to get a high enough rent to cover all the fees is not realistic for some major areas . also , he makes it sound like getting 150k is easy for a salary . unfortunately for those of us in stable `` normal '' fields like engineering , nursing , accounting , etc ... asking for a 30 % raise would get you a lot of laughs at best . nonetheless , i would still recommend it to other new grads
