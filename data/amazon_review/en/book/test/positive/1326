loved it i bought the book after reading a shorter tolstoy story , years ago . at first i was intimidated by the length of this story and couldnt get into it to start . finally , i picked it up again and was dissapointed i waited so long , it definitely doesnt seem as long once you get going . its an amazing book and has become one of my favorite
