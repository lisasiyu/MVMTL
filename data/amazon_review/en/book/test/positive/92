definitely not just for children ! this is one of the most beautiful pop-up books i have ever seen . as an adult without children , i have to say i would not want them handling it , as the work is so intricate and fragile . i would n't give this book to a child under 12 or so . that said , this book is truly a delight and a wonder and well worth owning . i do n't know how the authors do it but they 're amazing ! do n't hesitate to buy it ... just keep it away from your two-year-old . r-r-r-i-i-i-p ! !
