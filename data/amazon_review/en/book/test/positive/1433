useful study of academic bias american academic ido oren started his research by looking at the common idea that democracies do not fight each other . he shows how studies only support this idea because our concept of democracy is produced by the same historical patterns against which the claims are `tested ' , a history partly shaped by the usa 's international rivalries . so , before world war one , woodrow wilson , the political scientist , described imperial germany as an advanced constitutional state , a model for administrative reform . yet when he became president , woodrow wilson took the usa into war against germany , and described it as an autocracy . oren looks at american political science as an ideology : its claims to uphold the ideals of liberal democracy , as expressed , for instance , by samuel huntingdon , a past president of the american political science association . yet the apartheid government used huntingdon 's writings , as when he backed it against `the worse alternative ' of a government led by `the revolutionaries of the anc ' . he advised the apartheid government that increased authoritarianism might be necessary for reform , rationalising its repression , and he backed its `centralization of power ' . typically , the cia funded some of his research . oren studies american political science 's characterisations of the usa 's chief enemies last century , its concomitant characterisations of the usa , and its involvement in the wars against imperial germany , fascist italy , nazi germany and the soviet union . `` i document a systematic pattern of change in the portrayals of these enemies before and after their conflicts with us . '' also , he shows the pattern of concurrence between us wars and transformations in political science 's visions of the usa . the soviet union was seen as all state , no society , the usa as all society , no state . he chronicles the growth of intimacy between the political science profession and the state department , especially during the us attack on vietnam . oren asks whether `american political science might be more attached to america 's regime than to democracy ' . he concludes that it indeed works from the us state , not an objective , perspective .
