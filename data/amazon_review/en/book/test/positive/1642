de bono will make you think every so often you read a book that is so obvious that you are amazed you did not see it before . for me , this is such a book . yes , i could argue about the slow nature of the book , about the style or choice of phrase . however , the very simple idea ( singular ) at the core hit me like a billiard ball between the eyes at three paces . de bono takes the idea of thinking , and breaks it down into six different aspects , and proposes that all should be allowed at appropriate times in a meeting . the key is not that ( say ) raw emotion can be expressed unjustified , but that where necessary such feelings are not only encouraged , but that it is an everybody thing . participants are allowed to express a simple yes / no to an idea with no further comments . this , by the way , is `red hat thinking ' . each aspect of thinking is given a colour , so participants will wear the same hat at the same time , to view topics from a similar perspective . there is no compelling reason to have physical hats , but presumably this may help initially . examining each proposal in a critical way is allowed , but not all the way through any discussion - only at `blackhat ' time . this is a short , easy-read book . it would be possible to give a summary here of the six hats , and their meanings - however , it is better to let de bono do that . chapters are small and bite-sized , with an introduction and summary to each coloured hat . you do not need to read the book in one sitting , but it is probably advisable to tackle the 170 pages within 2 or 3 days . the author has written a number of other books on `thinking ' , and these are referred to in the text of the volume . for me , the references were about right - neither too many ( a sales pitch ) or too few ( not giving readers the opportunity to get further information ) . what did irritate me was the summary chapters for each hat , where the majority of sentences seemed to begin with e.g . `` blue hat thinking ... .. '' . at the end de bone gives a possible framework for using the principles within a meeting . this is helpful , and adds to the comments and examples throughout the text . the overall feel is that this is a book about thinking that is based in reality . my final thoughts concern interminable meetings i have attended , and national flags . use of the core idea of this thin volume would have saved man-months of my time , sometimes concluding that a meeting was not necessary . the national flag theme ? take a south african flag into meetings with you . this will remind you of the thinking hats , for the colours are the same . buy it , learn it , practice it , and do it . peter morgan , bath , uk ( morganp @ supanet.com )
