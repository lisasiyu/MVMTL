a different world it had been way too long since i picked up a heinlein title : `` stranger in a strange land '' being the last time i ventured into his densely written world 15 years ago . the book touts that this is `` science fiction 's most controversial novel '' ... and i can see that since it was written in 1964 . however , the disturbing elements of slavery , incest , and cannibalism cetainlty transcend time . as for the storyline , it is inetersting and well put together . this book seemed to me like two stories in one . the first half could be entitled `` the survivalist guide after the complete destruction of the world as we know it '' and i shall be certain to take this book with me for reference in the ( un ) liklihood i ever find myself in a bomb shelter or lost in the woods . the story finally takes a turn halfway through when we are introduced to the inhabitants of this future earth . the `` color war '' has taken a turn and now dark skinned folk are the masters and the light skinned people are the slaves . this new world is explained in detail as well as how the caste system works . our main characters adapt as best as they can according to their individual personalities . i do not entirely agree that there is nothing to like about farnham 's clan . it is a cross section of the kind of personalities that make up the world : leaders , fighters , followers , cowards , dependants , etc . the strong survive and the weak get sucked into and accept their lot ( even learn to like it ) . the time travel twist is one of the only features that make this title `` sci-fi '' . other than that , it can be looked upon as any other interesting work of fiction . if you can muddle through the first half of the book , dense with dialogue and technicalities that will make your head spin , you 're in for a good read . this book will make you think and consider how different a world can be if roles were reversed and democracy was no more .
