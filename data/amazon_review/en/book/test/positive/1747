excellent for world-themes in the classroom ! i have taught a couple of summer schools with prek and kindergarten students and we had soooo much fun with many of these songs . the absolute favorite is the first song `` hello to all the children of the world '' , which teaches children to say hello in different languages . we did half sign language , half movement which made it not only fun for the kids , but also for the parents when we sang this song to them . the other favorite songs : `` brown girl in the ring '' and `` going over the sea '' . if you are a teacher or even a parent , your kids will love this cd and will learn a little culture in the process
