't is pity so few people know about this play ! this is a highly emotional and well-written work that explores a very taboo subject matter . the play revolves a case of forbidden love , in this case , giovanni 's incestuous love for his sister annabella . it 's pretty easy to figure out after the first few pages that the play will have a tragic ending , but there are several major surprises that happen along the way , and the final scene is unbelievably violent . i 'd love the chance to stage a production of & quot ; tis pity & quot ; one of these days ... from a directorial standpoint , the script is filled with many interesting possibilities
