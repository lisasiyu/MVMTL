yea ! good book ! i really liked this book . it was funny and well-written and all those things that you like in a book . however , all of the reviews i read of this book said that mary anne was to blame , but i think dawn was a little , too . what i mean is , she was n't very sympathetic to mary anne . poor mary anne was moving into a brand-new house with a new family-a whole new lifestyle . and even though she had wanted to live with dawn and wanted their parents to marry , any big change is hard . i wish dawn had seen that . oh , well . great book ! perfect for a funny read
