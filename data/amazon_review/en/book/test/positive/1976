a fast read that is both informative and concise . i read the book on a flight from phoenix to denver with time to spare . the chapters are well organized and the material is reinforced to the reader by the use of worksheets and a self-test . though the depth of each of the topics covered is not extensive , the scope of the topics and the logical way they are presented allow the reader to develop a good grasp of the gist of project management . i am looking to make this book a mandatory read for employees going through our company 's project management curriculum
