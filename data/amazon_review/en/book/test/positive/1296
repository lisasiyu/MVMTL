it 's a long path the book is written in a way that does explain the japanese karate training experience very well . i 've done it for 35+ years and his book sums up a lot of things that take a long time to figure out . i was trained by a former jka kumite champion who came to the u.s. with little english and a goal of teaching karate as it was taught to him and figuring out what he was n't taught . he is still a great teacher although he has not reached out for the commercial aspects of karate . the book goes a long way in helping students understand the jka and what is the essence of the karate training . it will be interesting to see if the author can write another book in 10 more years about what else he has learned
