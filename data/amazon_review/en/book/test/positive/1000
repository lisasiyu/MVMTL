wow ! until now , i 'd not been not all that familiar or appreciative of graphic novels . i gave this book a try because i was interested in its jewish content . after reading it , i was surprised to learn that this was the first graphic novel in book form and that will eisner was a pioneer in his field . eisner 's drawings are magnificent , and the book 's content noteworthy and familiar . i like the idea of taking everyday characters and telling a story with pictures and dialogue . i especially like the tidbits of history that preceed each chapter and the amazing detail in the sketches of the tenement buildings and the scenery ( especially the falling rain ) . perhaps comics are not just for kids after all
