well done ! great ! it was about time that the biggest monster of them all was exposed . `` biggest '' , not simply because of the unprecedented number of deaths that he caused , but because he was so utterly trivial . as jung chang/halliday show , he was n't ideologically inspired , he had no liking for his own country and its tremendous culture , and he could n't sustain mature relationships with other human beings . his motivation was apparently selfish , spiteful and capricious , like the school bully who finds himself running the school . he let the chinese people starve , while pumping resources abroad to pay for military technology or win the approval of third world tyrants and `` liberation movements '' . again , great ! because this book may remind us in the west just how foolish many of our bright young people were back then . on the political demos of the sixties , the maoists stood out for their brutality and brainlessness , and total lack of any sense of humour . many of the intellectuals of the time seem to have been either fooled by maoism , or bought . they did dirt on the values of their own culture while ( figuratively or literally ) waving the little red book . most of them have moved on , but this book might just remind them of creepy behaviour that they 'd prefer to forget . finally , two criticisms that have been made of jung chang/halliday by some reviewers . firstly , the lack of balance . well , was there anything remotely attractive about mao or the things that he did ? he `` reunited china '' - yes , but that does n't mean that without him it would never have happened , in fact some of the political opponents that mao destroyed along the way might , given the chance , have presided over a far less monstrous regime . secondly , the journalistic style of the book . true , occasionally it lapses into cliche , but the text remains accessible and easily readable for anyone who wants to know more about mao . compare this with mao 's own turgid platitudes , or the incomprehensible screeds of marxist intellectuals . let mao have the last word . in 1940 he wrote the following , and one might stop to consider how he lived up to this commitment to the chinese people , and at what cost to them : `` it is not hard for one to do a bit of good . what is hard is to do good all one 's life and never do anything bad , to act consistently in the interests of the broad masses , the young people and the revolution , and to engage in arduous struggle for decades on end . that is the hardest thing of all !
