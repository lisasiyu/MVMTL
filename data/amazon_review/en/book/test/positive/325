the best poete maudit ! reading a poem by baudelaire is like sipping chardonnay on the quayside in paris . formidable ! i always return to this book , and i buy as many translations of it as i can . this one i think is the best . as a poet , baudelaire was the master of describing the `` dark regions '' of the human soul . he was the edgar allan poe of poetry .
