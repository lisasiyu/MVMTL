great educational resource ! i bought this book for our store reference . my staff became hooked , the information is solid and written in a way that reads like a book built for leisure . one critique ; there could be more pictures in her book , although a cliche - a picture is worth a thousand ( descriptive ) words . i will buy more books from ms matlins , she has established herself as the definitive writer for gems and pearls . thanks for the great reading material . veronica , ali'i jewelry - hawai
