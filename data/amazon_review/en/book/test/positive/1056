good advice for teens i purchased this book for a niece who is almost twelve and has recently lost her mother because of a traffic accident . this book offers good advice to young people who wish to make wise , godly choices . i , like dr. dobson , value the bible-based teachings that this country was founded on . secular people will not like this book .
