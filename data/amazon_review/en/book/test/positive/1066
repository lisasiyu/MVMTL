clear and concise i was impressed by this clear and concise guide . as an undergrad , i took a legal writing class . we had no textbook , but we could have used this one . now , i 'm in law school , where i found this book on my own . half the work is trying to figure out what legal types are saying . judges and lawyers could make my job easier by reading this book . as a student , i find it a good resource to help avoiding such pitfalls
