book you 'll enjoy in a guilty pleasure sort of way ! heard the cassette version of jackie , ethel , joan : women of camelot by . j. randy taraborrelli and enjoyed it -- in a guilty pleasure sort of way . it is a tell-it-all about the three kenney wives and listening to it helped me relive some days of my younger days when john , robert and ted kenney were alive and running for various political offices . for some reason , i never followed too closely the dirt behind their respective careers . . . yet this book more than made up for anything i may have missed . if everything in it is to be believed , i now know that joe kennedy offered jackie $ 1 million not to divorce jfk and jackie allegedly replied , `` the price goes to $ 20 million if jack brings home any venereal diseases . '' . . . also , that bobby had an affair with actress lee remick who actually called ethel to tell her that they were sleeping together -- only to be told by ethel that he was home in bed ( when he was actually with remick ) . . . and that ted once showed up for drunk with a prostitute for dinner with the king and queen of belgium , whose priceless antique coach ted 's date ruined by wetting it . overall , the book left me feeling sorry for the kennedy women . . . although they appeared so glorious from afar , how they were forced to live their lives because of the constant spotlight made life anything but easy for them .
