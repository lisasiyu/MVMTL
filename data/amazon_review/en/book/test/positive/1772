a view into how intelligence works it appears the the release of previously secret information from world war ii will never end . in this book , the authors have examined the files of the british air intelligence ( ai ) for every scrap of information they could find on every airplane that the germans had . then they organized this information so that each airplane has a chronological report of what the british learned , when , and from what source . the main sources are photo recon ( pr ) , prisoner interrogation , and examination of crashed planes . from a standpoint of studying the planes themselves , there are only a few tidbits of new data ( and some of the things that the brits learned were wrong and did n't show up until later ) . from the view of trying to see what the british were learning and how they learned it it is a fascinating piece of work . it gives an insight into how intelligence is gathered . it makes it much easier to understand about how big intelligence lapses ( pearl harbour , 9/11 ) can happen . a specialized book , but very interesting
