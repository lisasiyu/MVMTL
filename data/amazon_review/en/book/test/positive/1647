for the politically-oriented teen david levithan 's newest novel , `` wide awake , '' is a political novel set `` in the near future . '' here 's the set up : `` the greater depression happened . the events of 3/12 and 7/23 happened . the andreas quake and hurricane wanda . the president launched his war to end all wars , which only managed to create more wars and the tragic events of 4/5 . the greater depression deepened . millions of people died , and there was no way to erase their faces from the more renegade open news channels , which wanted to remind everyone how bad the government had let things get . the decents and their program of denial education reached their peak . '' the hero and narrator of `` wide awake '' is a jewish , gay teen named duncan who is engaged politically for the first time in his life . after all the troubles of his childhood and the generation ( s ) before , it seems as if a new era is on the horizon . his presidential candidate , abraham stein , a jewish gay man with a partner and children , has been elected . people are behaving differently , celebrating their ethnic , cultural , and sexual differences . and supporting them all is a sizable group of jesus freaks . `` for the jesus revolutionaries , the answer was clear : jesus would not be out waging `` preventative '' wars . jesus would not be withholding medicine from people who could not afford it . jesus would not cast stone at people of races , sexual orientations , or genders other than his own . jesus would not condone the failing , viperous , scandal-plagued hierarchy of some churches . jesus would welcome everyone to his table . he would love them , and he would find peace . '' sounds like a utopian novel so far , right ? but there 's a hitch . a hitch in the form of kansas . stein 's election is being contested . to the tune of 1,000 votes . ( sound familiar ? ) stein calls all his supporters to kansas and duncan and his friends head to topeka to support their candidate . while `` wide awake '' is a political novel , levithan does not abandon the everyday . duncan struggles in his relationship with gorgeous jimmy , teachers can be kind or belligerent , parents are sometimes more conservative than you 'd like , and friends take sides in everyday breakups . but , in the end , levithan 's message is one of hope . people can be good and good people can change even the worst-case scenario into a better present and future . `` wide awake '' is for older teens , ages 15 and up .
