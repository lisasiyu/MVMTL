a thinking horse and his man this is an excellent and accurate account of a horse that learned to spell and do simple math . it is also an amazing story of the emancipated slave who trained him . it gives an excellent history of the time after the civil war . it changed my view of what is possible . i was taught in psychology 101 that the horse gentle hans was a fraud and that he had learned to pick up unconscious cues from his trainer , that he was n't really able to think . beautiful jim key proved without a doubt that he was able to spell and do math and make change . wonderful history
