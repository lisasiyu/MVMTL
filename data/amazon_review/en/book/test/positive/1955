an 18th century essential i agree with the reviewers who 've described this as a slow read . no argument there . but it 's also a very important 18th century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period . if you read the book with an ironical slant it 's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations . granted , it may not be laugh out loud humor , but it is there . the poor vicar is modeled on the biblical job , to a very exaggerated extent . it 's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes , i know . if you 're looking for tight plot and fast pace this wo n't be your book , but those reading 18th century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now . you do n't read the vicar of wakefield for the plot . you read it for the study . it remains an important book
