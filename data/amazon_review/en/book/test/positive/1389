finally an accurate account ! the author has taken his time to present all sides of this important event in south carolina history . by taking a dispassionate look at the contemporary accounts as well as later oral histories he allows one to make up his or her own mind as the the true events . i found no evidence of any political slant . not a novel for light reading , but easy to read . makes a case as a good text , not only in the realm of black history , but in how one event can be looked at from numerous eyes . gives one a perspective on how the history we come to accept can be changed and minipulated depending on ones desires and point of view . highly recommend this in any student of south carolina or black histories library
