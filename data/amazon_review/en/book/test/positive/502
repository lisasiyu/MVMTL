my first dicken 's experience one word of caution to people about this book . there are many abridged versions out there so be careful to find one that is not . i originally picked up one at a used book sale , got it home and was astonished to find that it had only 400pp . i thought this was odd , so i searched about on the internet and realized that others were over 1000pp . long . needless to say , i went out and found an unabridged version to read . thankfully i realized my mistake early on . as far as the story itself goes , i was pleased with my first experience with dickens . i like a good 19th century novel filled with the ornate language and customs of the day . i very much liked dicken 's overtly satirical and even subtly derisive way of writing about issues like courts and aristocracy . even after almost 150 years , his views still ring true . i look forward to reading more of his books .
