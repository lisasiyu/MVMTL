the seminal defence of globalisation martin wolf , noted financial times columnist and professional economist , has written the most readable , empassioned and convincing defence of the new global economic order to date . wolf 's approach assumes little knowledge on the part of the reader , while at the same time demanding a keen intellect to follow all of his arguments through to their conclusions . most effective are his relentlessly convincing counters to virtually all of the objections raised by the rag-tag `` anti-globalisation '' crowd , as wolf clearly demonstrates that globalisation increases economic output and wealth everywhere and for everyone , and that without globalisation , poor countries are destined to remain poor . wolf 's main thrust is that the world needs more globalisation , not less , and he remains critical of western countries who themselves contribute to `` limited '' globalisation by continuing protectionist agricultural tariffs and retaliatory tariff and dumping practices . in all , a complete tour-de-force , and utterly convincing that the path we are on as a world is the right one , and that the arguments of the critics are more sentimental than real
