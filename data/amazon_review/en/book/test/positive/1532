the truth alot of reviews are saying the edgar rice burroughs did not actually write `` john carter and the giant of mars '' . the truth is that he did . this is what happened and what causes confusion : a childrens publisher wanted a short version of a edgar rice burroughs ' novel . mr. burroughs was concerned that he could not keep it short enough for the publisher so he asked his son to help craft a shorter story . at the same time , amazing stories asked edgar rice burroughs for another mars novel . a full lenght one to serialize . edgar took the short story and stretched it to a full novel . this is confirmed by several sources and by edgar rice burroughs estate . it explains why some of the novel strays from the rest of the series . so , yes his son was involved , but it is wrong to say that edgar rice burroughs did not write it . he did . especially the novel version . anyway , all of the mars books are exciting and i recomend all the books in the series
