this book really is definitive and realistic i have programmed in applescript for many years , but this book really helped to clarify a number of issues . this is no starry-eyed , applescript-can-do-anything fluff job , but a down-to-earth comprehensive description of a powerful , sometimes quirky , tool that will make your mac even more useful , if you are willing to invest some time to learn . i highly recommend this book for anyone thinking of using applescript , or anyone already using it
