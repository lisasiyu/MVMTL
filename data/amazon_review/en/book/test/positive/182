the roi of magic according to the authors , `` this book tells the inside story of justhow disney 's success was achieved -- not by epiphanic flashes ofcreative insight that produced a pinocchio or a dumbo , but by the forceof a much-considered , carefully wrought process of managing innovationand creativity and by an adherence to a firmly system of beliefs . `` the material is organized within 11 chapters , followed by an epiloguein which the authors observe that the integration and interplaybetween and among the ten principles they have examined can be ofsubstantial benefit to other companies . the `` dream , believe , dare , and do process '' does indeed have all manner of potentialapplications for companies in industries wholly unrelated toentertainment . there must be dreams to believe in and courage topursue those dreams . those who share my high regard for this book areurged to check out warren bennis ' organizing genius , one of whosechapters focuses on the disney team which produced snow white and theseven dwarfs .
