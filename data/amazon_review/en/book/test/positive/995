pcos this book has given my daughter and me more info on this disease than any doctor has been able to do . the book has given my daughter encouragement that she can live with this syndrome and that she can make her life better if she takes the metformin and gets her body moving . the info on food has helped sooooooo much . thank you for this book ! ! ! ! !
