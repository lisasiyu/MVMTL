kind of neat ... very , very interesting . i found this book by way of another pet communicator who , after doing a reading on my pets , recommended this book . i ca n't say i learned how to communicate telepathically with my pets , but ... hmmm ... what penelope smith says makes sense : quiet mind is the first step for so many other things , from good health to artistic creation to , yes , it certainly seems possible , telepathically communicating with animals . the trouble is , sorting out the junk from genuine communication . so , in all , so far , i have n't gotten all that much from this book . but i 'm very glad penelope smith wrote it . i know i will come back and re-read it
