jill sutcliffe vs eden & cedar paul i love this book , & i carried it wherever i go . stefan zweig is the greatest writer i ever known . his stories are so intriguing it 's hard to put it down . his writing skills are so lively that even though his books are translated , they are still extraordinary works . but i must point out that in the case of `` letter from an unknown woman : , jill sutcliffe translated & brought stefan 's work to life so much better than e & c paul . i have the 2 translations & i have to say jill is a much better translater in stefan 's work . i love all the stories in this book , & i hope jill will translate more of his work . his books should be the must read books in class .
