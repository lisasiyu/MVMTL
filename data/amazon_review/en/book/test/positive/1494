not an easy read , but worth it this novel was difficult for me to get into . the noir speak of the book presented itself as a barrier to entry . after training myself to think in terms of the language , i found myself so engrossed in the story that i moved through it at a steady pace . definitely a darker novel but the character development was outstanding
